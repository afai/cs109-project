    "#         {\"comments\":[\"Cohen is a great lecturer and provides great lecture notes that are easy to follow and edit as you do so, during class.  Thought-provoking assignments that are not difficult or frequent.  Thorough study info provided before midterm and final, which feature a very clever \\\"non-essay\\\" section in which you get to put down an outline of important info rather than slave over constructing an essay!  Good sections too!  A great class that's not hard.\",\"Be careful with your sections.  The expectations vary considerably section to section.\",\"I really enjoyed this class! Prof. Cohen is a very good lecturer and I feel like I learned a lot.  Don't be intimated if you have very little prior experience with the Bible.\",\"the judaism part was taught well because the professor was knowledgeable in that field, but the christianity part was neglected and taught in a biased way. although the professor claims that he tries to be as unbiased as possible, he really isn't impartial.(he knows about christianity only based on texts. i could tell that he never went to church, for example, because he didn't even know the fact that the Apocrypha are not included anymore(since early 20th century) in the Bibles of most Christian denominations. only Anglican denomination or some few denominations include Apocrypha in their Bibles along with the old and new testament.) every christian can tell that he believes in either judaism or modern scholar's view and makes christianity sound like a religion in which no sensible person would ever choose to believe. it seems that everything he says and thinks is based on the assumption that christianity can't be possible because science says such miracles as those in the Bible can't happen and thus  Jesus could never have resurrected. I guess that's what most people think... and that's fair. but if a professor really wants to be unbiased as he claims to be, he should agree with the fact that the history about and the resurrection of Jesus may possibly be true, because without that, one can never present Christianity in an unbiased way.\",\"A fine class in terms of a gen-ed, but not great. It's good in the sense that you don't have to put much work in, but you also probably won't get much out of it. The topic is pretty interesting and the course may have an impact on how you see Judeo-Christian relations or the Bible itself, but the lectures seem a little narrow and at the end of the course, you will probably just have memorized enough of what Professor Cohen specifically wants you to know in order to pass the final.\",\"This class was made great by Shaye Cohen. Shaye Cohen is a professor, author, Rabbi, and my personal hero. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo what was so great about Shaye Cohen? He made lectures awesome. Do you like professors with a sense of humor? Then you'll love Shaye Cohen. Do you like professors who remind you of more-Jewish and more-neurotic Larry David? Then you'll love Shaye Cohen. Do you like professors who are Shaye Cohen? Then you'll love Shaye Cohen.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaye Cohen has many mannerisms that made the class great. For instance, if someone would ask him a question he'd press his fingers to his mouth, make a kissing sound, and then proclaim \\\"Great Question!\\\" He would do this all the time. I would laugh every time he did it, it was just Cohen being Cohen. 'Classic Cohen' I would say.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaye Cohen would always joke that he might teach a class called 'Introduction to the New Testament' because one is not currently being offered at Harvard. Great idea! But why stop there Rabbi Cohen. I want to take 'Introduction to Buddhism' by Shaye Cohen, 'Introduction to Multivariate Calculus' by Shaye Cohen, or 'Introduction to Being Awesome' by Shaye Cohen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one factual error in the class. On the seventh day, God did not rest. On the Seventh Day, God created Shaye Cohen. And God saw that it was good.\",\"Great course! not too hard!\",\"This course is awesome! Shaye is the man!  Professor Cohen makes this class low-stress yet incredibly worth it!\",\"This class provides an excellent and objective start to Bible studies, especially for students who have never studied anything of the like before.\",\"Professor Cohen is a great professor and the class is interesting and very well run.\",\"Why would anyone not want to spend 2 hours a week listening to Shaye joke about interesting and relevant material?\",\"Although lectures can be boring sometimes, this class is overall very interesting. You will gain knowledge that will definitely give you a better understanding and appreciation for people of different religions. The workload is very manageable and the TFs are very helpful.\",\"If you want to learn about the schism in worship that caused Judaism and Christianity to become what they are now I would take this class. It's a fun and relatively stress free way to take care of a gen ed.\",\"Take it!  This is a great opportunity to study with a professor who is preeminent in his field.  A great (easy) gen ed where you can actually learn a lot without putting in a lot of effort.  Professor Cohen is also incredibly insightful and funny.\",\"Such an enjoyable class. The material is fascinating and essential for modern intellectual debates, the professor is hilarious and engaging, the workload is very light and the grading is kind. You will not be sorry you took it.\",\"Shaye is adorable. Take this class\",\"This course is only easy if you have a prior knowledge of the stories of the Old Testament, and can avoid writing from your own religious bias.\",\"Such a great class. Cohen is a great lecturer. I learned a ton about the Hebrew Bible and I'm thinking about taking his other class next fall. Can't recommend this one more!\",\"Great professor, great course.\",\"It does not require an overwhelming amount of effort to pass this class, and at the same time you learn a great amount of material in engaging lectures and fun section meetings.\",\"This course exams how both Judaism and Christianity diverged from a common Israelite religious ancestor.  This helps to explain the source of many interreligious misunderstandings.\",\"Take it. Cohen is amazing, and the TFs are great too, which is something you'll rarely find in a Gen Ed course. The papers are fun, and the readings aren't excessive. You'll learn to think differently about an important topic, too.\",\"This is an amazing class and the professor is very engaging. You definitely learn a lot on the subject matter.\",\"I really enjoyed this class. Cohen is a great lecturer. Definitely learned a lot of interesting info in this class. I had a pretty good foundation of Christianity, but I think non-Christians and non-Jews could succeed in this class fairly easily. I wish I did more of the reading because I would have learned more, but it was pretty easy to do well without doing a lot of it (as long as you know the passages for the passage ID's on the tests)\",\"It's a great way to learn about Judaism and Christianity with a relatively light workload. The instructors are experts, so it's really easy to learn from them.\",\"Take this class.  There is not much more to say.\",\"this class is great, especially as a gen ed. wonderful for people with and without experience in religion. both yoni and shaye are fantastic. and as a gen ed, it's interesting and you get a lot out of it, but it's not difficult or a lot of work.\",\"Great class, if you've never read the bible this will give you some insight into the bible in a nonbiased way from the viewpoint of Jewish and Christians. You'll also hear the opinions from your classmates. Never in this class did I feel pressured to take a certain belief at all. To be honest I expected more talk about Jesus but it's fine.\",\"This a great course with a light workload where you will learn a ton about the differences between Judaism and Christianity, which is really useful to know.\",\"Shaye Cohen is great!! The course is very enjoyable, but keep in mind that if you are a Christian, you'll probably feel differently about some of what is taught than your professor\\/TF's will.\",\"This class is an extremely interesting introduction to the Bible, and it makes you realize how differences in interpretation lead to two completely dissimilar religions while both are based on the same book. Prof. Cohen's lectures are engaging (and he will definitely improve your vocabulary). Not very demanding and you learn a lot -- the perfect Gen Ed.\",\"Great class that is very interesting!\",\"Really great Gen Ed.  Totally manageable workload and very interesting subject matter.  It's probably not great if you're looking for a survey of the content of the Hebrew Bible\\/Old Testament  However, if you come in having a pretty fair grasp of the stories, characters, history of the text, this course will have you contextualize your knowledge with a critical eye in a way that was almost certainly never demanded (or encouraged) of you in Sunday School.\",\"This is definitely an easy GenEd. The TFs and Professor Cohen truly want their students to succeed. However, I would have rather taken a more challenging and engaging class. Towards the end of the term, lecture got boring and the readings were pretty dry.\",\"This a tremendous course that will reveal much of the basis of cultural differences that are linked to faith.\",\"This course is a gem. You learn very interesting and relevant things, but the course is not burdensome in any way. I highly recommend taking this course.\",\"The saddest thing about this course was the students.  I recommend this course because the work isn't much and the assignments aren't hard but PLEASE only do it if you have interest in the material and take it seriously at least.  It ruins the experience for everyone when no one cares and is just doing it to take an easy course.\",\"Interesting material, and the assignments aren't too strenuous. Deadlines were very flexible and exams were straightforward. A great way to fulfill a GenEd.\",\"This class has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard. The material is very engaging and Professor Cohen does a great job in lecture. If you're looking for an easy yet interesting GenEd, then this class if for you!\",\"This class provides a fairly non biased representation of Judaism and Christianity, and you will definitely learn a lot.\",\"This class is one of the best I have taken at Harvard. Everyone needs to take this class...it is so important to be able to question religious beliefs in a society that is often much too politically correct. Professor Cohen is AWESOME and hilarious. I'm a devout Catholic and I loved him and this class. It made me into a better person, honestly, by making me thinking about things I had previously just accepted as true without a second thought. I'm still as Catholic as ever, but much more knowledgeable about religion and literary\\/historical interpretation in general. Take this class!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\"This a pretty easy Gen Ed with not too much work or reading. Definitely one of the best Culture and Belief.\",\"This class requires very little work and I'm really glad I learned the material taught in this course. I knew very little about the Hebrew Bible before taking this course and now I have a good base of knowledge to draw from.\"]},\n",

There is a decent amount of reading but the material is very interesting and not too difficult to understand.\",\"Classes were thought provoking and sections were informative and fun.  Unfortunately though, I could not help make the Thanksgiving sweet potatoes for the first time in a decade because a major essay was due midnight before Thanksgiving day.\",\"Great Gen-ed!\",\"Take it! I feel like every educated person should know the material in this class. As someone from a Muslim country, I had no idea about the history of Judaism, and ended up liking every minute of the class! Also, Professor Cohen is a fascinating lecturer.\",\"The professor is a lot of fun and lectures are enjoyable. If you know Judaism, Christianity and OT well then much will be review.\",\"Great gen-ed or elective to take! Prof. Cohen is a great lecturer and chooses very interesting topics to discuss.\",\"This class is extremely fascinating!!! TAKE IT\",\"A great and painless way of doing the Culture and Belief Gen Ed. Exams are very fair, and there are two 4-5 page essays total. Readings are light, and TFs are good. I went into the course hardly knowing what Judaism and Christianity were, and I came out of it with a solid understanding of their foundations and the differences between them. Really worth taking (though I could picture the course being too basic for people with a thorough knowledge of these religions).\",\"This class is everything a gen-ed should be. It is interesting, taught well, and straight-forward. The professor and TFs all want you to learn, but also want you to do well. The course offers a lot of materials: lecture videos, lecture notes, etc. in order to help you learn and study. Also, the essays are not incredibly tedious to write and interesting. Ari is a great TF.\",\"Take this class for an easy and rewarding gen ed requirement\",\"Everything you want in a Gen Ed. An interesting topic presented by an engaging lecturer, with friendly and knowledgeable course staff and not too much work. Looking back, I learned a whole lot because the assignments were meaningful.\",\"Professor Cohen is a delightful lecturer and for someone who is illiterate in the bible, the course material is very interesting. The class is on the Hebrew Bible but it covers a lot about the New Testament also.\",\"CB23 is awesome. Shaye Cohen is great and sections are engaging. The subject matter is very interesting and the workload is pretty low. There are two papers along with a midterm and a final. Take CB23 or a similar course with Shaye Cohen depending on what is offered next year.\",\"It's helpful to have some knowledge of the Bible and to have some knowledge about Judaism or Christianity, but certainly not necessary.\",\"This course has a bias AGAINST Christianity that is evident through Shaye Cohen's teaching style. He presents weak cases for Christianity and thus makes Christianity seem non-sensical and fails to present modern Christian views on the historical events of the Old Testament.\",\"Incredible\",\"This class will make you a smarter more worldly person with a higher GPA.\",\"With minimal work put in, I feel that I have learned a lot from this course. You absolutely do not need to come from a religious background, although you will probably be able to relate to the course more if you're Jewish or Christian. I came away from this course with a much deeper understanding of both Judaism and Christianity, and the work load was quite light.\",\"If you're looking for a culture and belief course, I highly recommend this course. If you're looking for an interesting elective to take, this fits the bill as well, and since the workload is pretty light it also works as a fifth class. The professor tries to make the course easy and enjoyable while trying to make sure that you get something out of the class.\",\"This class was disorganized, and I did not get as much out of it as I had hoped. For the first half of the course the lectures skimmed over the material because last year's lectures were already posted on iTunesU and Prof Cohen expected students to watch the lectures online before actual lecture. This did no work out very well, as the class was FAR too big to facilitate discussion in a lecture setting, making the whole course just feel disjointed and confused. Then for the second half of the course Prof Cohen started doing more cohesive lectures again, which improved the situation slightly, but things still felt very disorganized and hard to follow.\",\"This class isn't too demanding and it is very interesting.\",\"This course is great. You'll luck out if you get Josh for section. He's a phenomenal TF and a cool dude.\",\"This class is very easy. There isn't much of an incentive to engage very much in lecture or with the readings, which is a bit of a bummer.\",\"A lot of people criticize this class for being too easy. I believe it is a straightforward class, but you learn so much that applies to the real world. For someone like me who didn't know too much about Judaism or Christianity and their relationship, it was super useful and interesting highlighting the things you wonder about like what Yom Kippur means, what's matzah bread, and the list goes on. I really enjoyed it - Cohen is a hoot.\",\"Very interesting material. Great lectures. Light workload.\",\"This is a great gen-ed, and you should take it. Shaye Cohen is such a great teacher: witty, sarcastic, and knows everything there is to know about the Hebrew Bible! Section discussions are very interesting, and the material is pretty engaging if you get into it (which you should! it's so cool!). You feel totally prepared going into the midterm and final, cause the teaching staff gives you all the terms you need to know and holds great review sessions, which are so helpful. They want everyone to succeed and learn about the Hebrew Bible, and they work hard to make this happen! I learned so much that I didn't know before, and really feel that I could say a lot about Judaism and Christianity after this course. TAKE IT!\",\"C&B 23 is a good and interesting way to fulfill the Culture and Belief requirement. Cohen is realistic with his expectations which is extremely important not only in that it makes the class more do-able, but you also learn more as you are not overwhelmed and therefore better able to synthesize the material.\",\"This class is a must! Hopefully it is offered again next year!\",\"Take this class if you are interested in the Bible! You will learn a lot in a relaxed environment.\",\"Fantastic class. Smart, cool professor. Teaching staff really just wants you to learn and enjoy the material. Not too much work and you learn a lot. I highly recommend it (from a science concentrator).\",\"It's a very manageable course and actually way more interesting than I ever anticipated.\",\"Take this if you are interested in the subject material.  Cohen is a good man and is pretty entertaining in lecture if you interact with him.  The workload is very manageable.  The tests require a good deal of learning ids, so curiosity in the subject helps.\",\"It's a good class if you don't know much about Judaism or Christianity, and it isn't too challenging.\",\"Good CB gen-ed. Not too difficult but you learn a decent amount and exam and essays are fairly straight forward.\",\"Class is awesome.  Take it!\",\"Great, easy gen ed! Prof. Cohen is a very engaging lecturer, personable and funny.

You put in very little investment but learn a LOT. It's a low investment-high return class. You get to read a lot of ancient works and important Bible passages. In addition, you get to know about how Judaism and Christianity connect with each other in terms of interpretation and reinterpretation. It provides a lot of insight. I would recommend this class with great enthusiasm. Especially when the texts are all important and provide context in daily life.\",\"It's definitely an advantage to be Jewish or Christian.\",\"I learned so much in this class about the differences between Judaism and Christianity, which is something I've always wondered about. The only assignments in this class are two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final, and they give you everything you need to know for the final. Take this class!\",\"This class is really amazing! It's not too much work but you will learn SO much about Judaism and Christianity even if you identify with one of these religions and already feel like you know a lot.  I wish that Harvard had more classes like this!!\",\"This is a good CB class. Professor Cohen is an interesting an engaging lecturer. Nothing revolutionary but if you go to lecture and do the readings, you'll learn a lot.\",\"make sure you're actually interested in the subject material aka the Bible\",\"Take the class. It's a low-stress, rewarding course that might inspire you to reshape your religious beliefs.\",\"Everything a gened should be.  Staff does a good job inviting people to engage, you learn a lot about something important, the A is there provided you do some work\",\"Christianity and Judaism are so important to Western Civilization that one must take this class to understand them.\",\"Solid Class. Very easy. The teaching staff is intelligent and understanding.\",\"This class was awesome. I learned a lot about both Judaism and Christianity. The lectures were balanced and interesting. Shaye is an engaging lecturer.\",\"This class is great. Not too overwhelming and fairly graded. The best culture and belief you can take.\",\"Great way to fulfill a gened. It's a really interesting class.\",\"TAKE IT. Rabbi Cohen is such a great lecturer that I watched 12 hours of his lecture videos for FUN even though I (and all my friends) had a 98 average going into the final. The paper topics were actually fun to write, and section revealed mind-blowing secrets of the Bible. This is not a class on Jewish history or Bible study, it's about showing how Christianity and Judaism grew out of the same roots and influenced each other as they developed. Really fun, total gem, I loved it and so will you.\",\"this course is very informative and useful for understanding the christian and jewish faith. It is very easy and requires minimal work. Everyone should take this class\",\"awesome class, great and very nice staff. however, lectures and sections may often be (understandably) biased toward the Jewish perspective.\",\"A great way to get your Culture and Belief out of the way. Exams and papers are very reasonable and straightforward. Some religious background makes it easier but isn't necessary.\",\"This is an extremely easy class to fulfill your Culture and Belief requirement with. It can be interesting if you really want it to be and you engage with all of your readings. But you can also get an A without really doing anything the entire semester.\",\"If you're Christian, expect to be challenged, but remember that a man with experience is always better armed than a man with just arguments.\",\"Great course! Super interesting material, you learn a lot about the Hebrew Bible and the differences between modern and classical Judaism and Christianity. A great 5th class, gen-ed which is both relatively stress-free and extremely interesting.\",\"a very fun and interesting primer on two religions you should really be aware of\",\"Great if you want to just learn a little about the bible\",\"It's a perfect class: you actually learn\\/retain important information that is important for so many millions of people and you experience it in a non-aggressive\\/difficult manner. I felt comfortable learning.\",\"Absolutely Great Class. Great introductory class on Judaism and Christianity.\",\"This class is easy and incredibly interesting. If you choose to engage with the material in a lot of depth, you will come out of the course with a great repertoire of knowledge. If, on the other hand, you want an easy class with a minimal workload, this class will also suit you. It caters to a wide variety of students. I strongly recommend it.\",\"Shaye is awesome, and the class is interesting without being overly consuming.\",\"Take this class if you want to learn about Judaism and Christianity without going to lecture or reading.\",\"It's a really painless way to fulfill a gened if you have some background in christian or jewish theology. However, at the same time, even though I had a good christian background in the material this class was covering, I realized that I still learned a lot from this class at the end. It was really interesting to see a Jewish perspective on a lot of the things I had learned and definitely made me think a lot more.\",\"Its a pretty easy, light course with some interesting material.\",\"Great introduction to differences between Judaism and Christianity. I knew nothing at all and still was fine.\",\"pay attention do the readings, youll be fine\",\"Incredible class- definitely take this if you have the opportunity. Little to no work required and amazing TFs.\",\"I loved this course. You'll learn a whole lot about the differences between Judaism and Christianity and their origins. As a hard science major, it's nice to have something to actually talk about rather than integrals. At the same time, this course is incredibly low-stress, one of those gems in the gen-ed department.\",\"Professor Cohen really cares about the class and the students, which is good. The lecture style isn't really my favorite. I think the material of the class is so captivating that lectures could have been a bit better - the style kind of felt like we were going down the class topic, stopping a lot with jokes and for participation, and sort of reviewing things seeing them for the first time. Professor Cohen is though very knowledgeable about the material, approachable, and generally pretty funny. The course isn't hard, just make sure you put in some work in your rough drafts to get helpful comments, and outline before the exams and you'll be fine. It's a good way to fulfill the CB gen ed, will teach you some very relevant and interesting material and works well as a 5th class.\",\"this class has been one of my favorites at harvard.  it's easy but not an insult to your intelligence but you have to put in the work which is totally manageable.   the professor gives awesome lectures, it's interesting material, the tfs actually want you to do well and are so helpful\",\"The class is interesting, but you have to choose to learn what Prof. Cohen has to teach. Fairly easy, but not ridiculous.\",\"This is a wonderful class- Judaism and Christianity are obviously immensely important to the world, and this course will help you understand both of them better.\",\"TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Cohen is hilarious and a fantastic teacher. The TFs are also super nice. The material is really interesting, and it's good to have knowledge on the Bible. I honestly loved this class. If you miss a class, the notes are online, and they're really easy to understand (which is good if you maybe don't feel like going to a morning class occasionally!). I have 0 complaints about this course. Take it. Also, very low workload.\",\"This class was very interesting. I am Christian and I learned a ton through the class (lectures, readings, section). The workload is definitely manageable (2 essays, 1 midterm and 1 final), and you get the questions for the exams beforehand (IDs and \\\"non-essays\\\"). This class go through many topics and the point views in both Christianity and Judaism. I now see my religion under a new light.\",\"This is a great and easy class if you have Jewish or Christian background. If you don't, it is a lot harder of a learning curve and might not make it worth it if you are just looking for an easy course. Shaye Cohen is hilarious and a great professor, although his lecture style doesn't work for some. The course materials are super accessible and you don't necessarily need to buy any of them, which is also great!\",\"The course is a good first step towards some level of biblical literacy. Regardless of whether the student has any religious affiliation, some knowledge of the Bible is important in a world in which a third of its population is Christian or Jewish.\",\"I highly recommend CB23. If you take this class, take advantage of Professor Cohen's really wonderful teaching. He does an amazing job of helping you navigate the Hebrew Bible, but you can't benefit from it if you haven't laid eyes on the assigned passages. You can skip the readings and still get an A, but if that's your style, you're wasting a good education that other people would die for.\",\"If you go to section and study for the exams this course will be straightforward\",\"This is a great class for two reasons. 1) It is an easy GenEd that will ease a heavy workload. 2) The content of the course is very interesting especially if you're not very knowledgable about Judaism and Christianity.\",\"A great, great Culture and Belief Gen-Ed. It presents really interesting material, the entire historical background of the break between Judaism and Christianity, and it really wasn't that much work at all. Notes\\/videos are all online, so going to class is not an absolute necessity (although it's definitely helpful). Make sure you study the passages before exams: the ones that popped up on the final were kind of hard, and ones that we hadn't really gone over at all.\",\"You should DEFINITELY take this course because of the fascinating subject matter (even if you're Christian or Jewish, you'll take a way a great deal from this class) AND the wonderful professor, Shaye Cohen, and his teaching staff. Do not take it because of the reviews it has received, especially because it looks easy. Yes, you will not struggle in this class as much as you might in other classes, but if you put in a good deal of time into it, you'll come away with a lot.\",\"I would tell them that is an easy class, but also a class that you learn a lot from, which is an unusual combination.\",\"YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS COURSE. Prof Cohen is really knowledgeable and actually pretty funny. I absolutely loved the class and while I did already have interest in the material, I can imagine that even if you don't it wouldn't be too painful--plus there's tons of ways to relate it to current events even if it isn't pertinent to your life. The workload is light as well. Basically this is a class that you'll learn a lot from and it will make you feel smart because the grading is pretty easy.\",\"Fascinating. I learned so much about theology, history and my religion, as well as Christianity. I feel far more informed about religion having taken this course.\",\"If you come with no or little Judeo-Christian background, this is a really wonderful course to learn about how these faiths grew together and in contrast to one other.  If you are rather familiar with the Hebrew Bible already, in whatever context, the course may not be extremely intellectually stimulating, though it is certainly well-taught and generally enjoyable.\",\"This is a great introduction to the Hebrew Bible, and the foundation of Judaism.\",\"This is an amazing class. Professor Cohen's lectures are fun and engaging and so is section. The material is fascinating, not to mention the midterm, essays, and final are easy and painless.

EVERYONE should take this class - absolute best way to fill your C&B req. Yes, it's easy, but it's the farthest thing from boring - if you put in just a little bit of effort, you will get a LOT out of this class.

I learned a ton of interesting things, wrote papers about interesting topics, had a great experience with the teaching staff, and really enjoyed lectures.

Take advantage of it.\",\"As long as you put effort into the assignments, you will do fine\",\"Shaye Cohen is an AMAZING lecturer. He never lets any of his lectures get boring and he tries his best to make difficult-to-understand information very digestible for his students. The sections are optional, which is great. I learned A LOT in this class and I would definitely highly recommend it to future students. This is definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.\",\"It's a good, interesting class.\",\"No preparation or background necessary, but you will be expected to care about Judeo-Christian theology.

Shaye is awesome, as are the TFs. It has really changed the way I view my life and religion in general. Such a breath of fresh air, and the material is so interesting.\",\"This is a class with a low workload. However, it will drag on unless you're actually interested in this stuff. Be warned.\",\"great class for understanding religious concepts\",\"The most straightforward class at Harvard. There are no surprises on the midterm or final (which are amazingly easy), and the papers are graded fairly. Aside from that, legitimately interesting and very well taught by Professor Cohen and the TF staff.\",\"Yes, this class has a reputation for being easy.  And yes, it generally is.  But be careful to keep up with the work and to go to lecture.  It is easy to push this class aside, but doing so will come back to hurt you when you have exams and papers.\",\"Easy but you may not get much out of it; easy to do very little.\",\"This class is not particularly difficult or time-consuming. The lecture notes cover all of the material from lecture, so it is not necessary to go to lecture. That being said, Shaye Cohen is an entertaining and helpful lecturer, so it is possible to enjoy and learn from his lectures, though it may not be worth waking up for a 10:00 AM lecture to do so. Along similar lines, it's possible to study for the exams on the day before, though it takes quite a bit of work to do so.\",\"I loved this class. You put in way less work than the amount of knowledge and learning you get out of the class! Great senior spring class!\",\"It is light on work.\",\"Prof. Cohen is very entertaining and this class presents interesting concepts. Beware, though, it does seem to belittle actual belief as seems to do a lot of modern biblical scholarship. Overall, though, this is an exceptional way to get your gen-ed requirement done.\",\"This class is not very difficult, but it has many problems. The lectures are not very engaging and the sections are disorganized. Despite this, the material is quite interesting, but the course needs to be restructured before it can be very effective.\",\"Objective study of Christian and Jewish faith\",\"So easy. Don't have to go to lecture or section. Just do the reading. You'll be fine.\",\"Great.\",\"Great discussion on the Christian and Jewish faiths. The argument for Christianity is not strongly presented, but a good number of points are raised.\",\"Take this class. One of the best and easiest classes you'll ever take. It's awesome.\",\"This course is a very interesting way to delve into the bible in a very accessible way. The class is not difficult, but that does not mean that it is not rewarding. It does an excellent job of fostering a new thought process and method for viewing interpretation and divergence of religions. It is a worthwhile class and Shaye Cohen is a funny, enthusiastic professor.\",\"This is a great class. Well-structured.  Well-taught.  TFs and Professor are awesome.\",\"I chose to take this class because I found the subject interesting and it promised to be easy. I was not disappointed with respect to either. It was a great choice as an easy 5th class. If you are interested in Christianity or Judaism, this class is really informative. I am Christian and I thought the class helped me think about what I personally believe in for religion in general as well as organized religion. My one disappointment is that I felt that the seeming lack of effort\\/attention made section not worth my time.\",\"Very interesting class. I learned a lot about religion.\",\"A good class.  You can get from it what you put in.  If you want an easy class where you can skip lecture and section, this class is nice.  If you choose to go to them, you can learn a lot of interesting stuff.\",\"This class is extremely interesting, and with the right amount of effort, it is easy to do well!\",\"Professor Cohen is such a fantastic person!! Get to know him during his public office hours right before class begins!\",\"Class is super easy. Not being religious I thought I would be at a disadvantage. I did all the studying for the final in a day, after not attending a single lecture after the midterm. On both the final and midterm they give you the possible essay topics and tell you how to answer them. Somehow though the course actually taught me a lot\",\"It's an easy class, not one that you can blow off, but if you just go to lecture or watch the videos, you're totally set. A painless way to get through the CB requirement.\",\"Prof. Cohen is an awesome lecturer- In addition to being clear and structured in his lectures, he slips in jokes and sometimes bursts into song, and obviously enjoys teaching the class! All of the material included in his lectures is well thought out and important to know in order to understand the subject matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo all of the readings before lectures and take notes on them- this will help tremendously when exams happen! Exams are manageable so long as you take a few days to reread the Bible passages, fill out the lists of vocab, and prepare for the essay questions (which are provided in advance).\",\"Great way to fulfill gen ed or as an elective. Interesting material and not too difficult.\",\"Prof. Cohen and the TFs are fantastic. A great course for anyone interested in how the Hebrew Bible and its interepretations ramify in Judaism and Christianity, both through history and today\",\"I've never had a more perfect class at Harvard. Awesome course material, perfect and engaging Professor who genuinely cares about his students. And plus, the course was set up in a way that you essentially had a section with a close knit group of people who were really interested in learning about the course material. This allowed for interesting, passionate, and informative discussions.\",\"to participate in the sections\",\"It's a fairly easy class that's also quite fun, I'd recommend it. Also Prof. Cohen gives reaallly engaging lectures - so you don't fall asleep even though it's 10am!\",\"Despite being easy (as I'm sure is why you're looking at these reviews), you actually do learn a lot in the class, and Professor Cohen is the best.\",\"Easy course\",\"This is a great class; the classic painless Gen Ed. Just two 5-page papers, an easy midterm and final. Essay topics for the exams were provided beforehand, and we only needed to write outlines for the exams, not actual essays. Plus, section is optional! Also, Prof. Cohen is a pretty funny guy, and if you pay attention you'll learn a lot.\",\"Certified gem. You can literally not do any work for this class the entire semester except for 4 days--the days before the midterm, final, and when the two papers are due.\",\"This is a great was to fulfill the CB gen-ed. Doing the readings \\/ going to section will make the class easier when exams come, but they are probably not necessary to do well in the course. Lectures are interesting.\",\"If you are looking to fulfill your culture and belief requirement, and have any interest in religion, this class is for you.\",\"This is a fantastic class - it is almost the ideal gen ed. Professor Cohen knows that people take it because it is easy, and he seems fine with that as long as people are absorbing the materials. Lectures were all filmed and came with lecture notes, so it is not a huge deal to go to lecture (although if you fall behind there is a lot of ground to cover). The class is extremely interesting, and you really learn a lot about the history of Judaism and Christianity. Cohen presents a pretty fair split of the Bible between both the Christian and Jewish viewpoint. The papers are pretty fine - you get feedback on a draft before you submit your final draft. The midterm and final are very very fair, and he gives you everything you need to know beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat introduction to the topic, don't take if you're looking for something very in depth. \\r\\n\\r\\nTake this class if you know nothing about religion and are interested in learning more!\",\"It is definitely a reasonable work-load.\",\"Fascinating\",\"If you have no previous knowledge of the Bible it may be a little trickier than you think. A lot of people in the class clearly have a basic understanding of general concepts, and so have a bit of a head start on you. It's still straightforward material, it just feels like you're a little behind the game.\",\"A very good course for people with busy schedules that are looking for a gen ed that will teach them something without becoming annoying. Expect that some of the people taking the course however will really just not know or care about what is going on. This can make section and the online piazza tool painful.\",\"Painless and I learned a lot! Prof Cohen is very engaging.  I had no interest or knowledge in religion before this class, but very much enjoyed it.\",\"This class is definitely not an automatic A but it is relatively easy, especially if you put in a little work.\",\"Learned a pretty good amount for the little work I put into it. Easy.\",\"I was not raised religious nor did I know much about the Bible before taking this class, and I loved it! It's an easy C&B gen ed, but at the same time extremely interesting. I now have the tools to really talk to my religious friends more seriously. At the same time, I would caution against taking it if you are very religious because this is a class that somewhat lightheartedly discusses the Bible from an objective, modern scholar point of view.\",\"Shaye = awesome\",\"CB23 is really interesting and well taught. I had 0 knowledge of religion\\/religious background going in, and I am definitely grateful I took this course. It is pretty easy, but mostly because the class is just so straightforward. There's no beating around the bush\\/guessing what you are supposed to know.\",\"Great class and professor! Learned a lot without having to do much work.\",\"If you need the CB GenEd, take this class. If not, it's still a great way to learn about the subject. Here's what's good:\\r\\n1) Teaching staff. Tr\\u00c3\\u00a9s dope.\\r\\n2) Course materials. Well-written, digestible, solid amount.\\r\\n3) Lectures available online. #nevergoing2classever\\r\\n4) Review session covering the essay questions right before exams. Hella helpful.\\r\\nAnd like nothing bad. So you gucci.\",\"This is a great senior spring class. You will actually learn useful things about the bible, Judaism, and Christianity without having to pull any all nighters.\",\"Fun easy yay ya learn about topics that come up every day and has caused so much turmoil in the world\",\"This class is interesting, but to a certain extent you need to be active in trying to learn. It's possible to do well enough in this class without any effort, but you can also learn a great deal.\",\"It's definitely a good gen ed if you don't like going to class; everything is pretty much optional because the lecture is video taped and section is optional. (Though this may change.) I will say, as someone who didn't attend section, it probably would have been helpful, especially for exam prep. Also, do the readings. That would have also helped...\",\"Would do it to fulfill Gen Ed requirement, and it's a great class if you enjoy the material and devote time to it. But you can get lazy and stop going to lecture, and quickly loose track of the class.\",\"AMAZING - Professor Cohen is the best, he is so engaging and will make the effort to get to know you if you show up 5 minutes before lecture. The class is well organized, covers interesting material, and the teaching staff is amazing.\",\"This was by far one of my favorite classes at Harvard! Easy assignments and very interesting material to learn.\",\"This class is a gem. Take it to fulfill CandB-no question. The reading is all very quick and easy. There are only 2 5 page essays all semester, a midterm, and a final exam. It'll be even easier if you are familiar with the Old Testament\\/truth claims of Jews and\\/or Christians. In short, the perfect Gen Ed.\",\"The course covers interesting material that is extremely important. The workload is minimal, and the grading is extremely generous. All you can ask for in a gen ed.\",\"Super easy, great TFs, lots of study guide material, excellent feedback. Best gen ed ever!!!\",\"The class is pretty straightforward. However, keep up with the readings as it's easy to fall behind. Go to section and pay attention during lecture.\",\"This course is fun and interesting. Great introduction to both religions and very applicable for knowledge about life.\",\"It seems that the teaching staff and professor do not take this course very seriously. The free-for-all unstructured sections reinforce this. The material itself is interesting and could be more thoughtfully engaged in the course.\",\"You should definitely take this class if you need to fulfill your CB requirement, or just need a fun class that isn't super stressful!  Professor Cohen is really fun and really cares about the class.  His effort and enthusiasm for it makes it hard not to enjoy lecture (when you go).  This class is also nice because you can miss a lot and it's all online and there are nice lecture guides that Prof. Cohen types up so you don't even need to take notes.  There's not a lot of work (just 2 short essays) and so studying is all you really need to do.  It doesn't take long to learn all the terms, and you feel pretty accomplished after.  You should definitely take this class!  It's easy, but fulfillig.\",\"Great, stress free class to take if you want a general background in Judaism and Christianity without doing a ton of work.\",\"Minimal work; not very engaging. Didn't read much of the bible.\",\"The professor does a good job of reviewing material that students don't quite grasp on the first go around.  If you attend lecture and section, you should be on top of the material.\",\"This class is a gem.  Professor Cohen is the man, and he is always willing to meet with students before class to review material.  If you are at least moderately religious or have some sort of background in religion, this class will be a breeze.  You'll also learn a lot about the origins of Judaism and Christianity.\",\"If you do the readings you can't go wrong.\",\"stay on top of readings and lectures... exams can sneak up on you\",\"Don't just get by with the material but use it to learn!\",\"Great class and great professor! I really feel like I learned about the Hebrew Bible. As someone with very little background in religious education, this was very helpful and interesting to me.\",\"Professor Cohen is a great lecturer. Lectures are fun to go to; it makes the class worthwhile . The readings aren't really necessary. I think the tfs have a good sense of humor. Light class leaves you w a lot of practical knowledge. I really enjoyed it.\",\"Highly recommend the course. Taught me a lot about Christianity and Judaism that I did not know prior. Professor Cohen is a gem.\",\"This is a good course to fulfill the CB requirement. Shaye Cohen is a fun lecturer, and the class isn't too demanding. I learned a lot about how Jews and Christians justify their faiths, and I'd recommend the course.\",\"An easy course that is also very informative and interesting.\",\"This course is super chill. The papers are very doable and the coursework is almost non existent. If you have some back ground in the Bible, want to hear interesting lectures, and don't want to overload on coursework, this is the way to go.\",\"This class is very manageable and enjoyable if you put the work in.\",\"take it take it so easy but still interesting. only studying i did was before final and midterm. lectures interesting even if you don't go to all or most.\",\"They grade essays very arbitrarily.\",\"you MUST take this course!\",\"Even though section isn't mandatory, go to section! It helps so much.\",\"Great course where I got to explore key questions pertaining to my faith as a Catholic.\",\"Go to the classes, the subject matter and Professor Cohen are very interesting\",\"Take it. Great class.\",\"This class cultivates the perfect learning environment\",\"This was an amazing course.  Professor Cohen is so passionate about the class and his students and makes every lecture interesting.  The structure of the class makes the workload extremely manageable, with typed lecture notes, taped lectures, online readings, etc.  The material is interesting and unique, different from various other courses at Harvard, and it is quite refreshing to understand both the Christian and the Jewish interpretations of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament.\",\"This is a great, fun, relatively painless course.\",\"This class is the perfect combination of interesting and easy. It teaches you about religion in a way that made me feel like a more educated person. Great class!\",\"Best gen ed course at Harvard. Incredibly well taught, interesting and valuable course material, all in a not-so-demanding course. I would take this class even if it didn't fulfill C&B.\",\"Great class. Prof Cohen is a legend.\",\"Very low stress class that covers a very interesting topic. If you're interested in understanding the differences between Judaism and Christianity, this is a great class to learn about it without stressing too much about work load.\",\"This class was one of my favorites I had ever taken. It is the perfect difficulty level and you get a lot out of the class. I learned more from this class than from many others at Harvard, simply because this knowledge was so relevant to the world around us. Professor Cohen is so great at breaking down very complex material into much simpler, easy-to-understand themes, and the course follows a very logical and organized structure. While studying for the final exam, it was so exciting to see how all of the material connected to each other, too. I also came into this class with no religious background (I had never been to church or synagogue before), and was worried that I would have a hard time in this class. But no prior knowledge is necessary- if you do your assignments, you will be just fine! I learned so much. However, if you DO have prior knowledge, this course can still be equally as rewarding- especially because you go back and forth discussing Jewish and Christian material.\",\"This class is great! Requirements are very clear and the material is really interesting. You learn a lot but the workload is manageable.\",\"This is an awesome class if you put work into it, but if you treat it like an easy gened you won't get much.\",\"Go to class and do the readings and you'll learn a lot!\",\"Professor Cohen and the TF's work extremely well together to develop a fair and interesting course that they are passionate about. The TF's are extremely interested in getting to know the students and helping them to engage in the subject-matter. The course is important for understanding western civilization.\",\"This class is easy, but unlike a lot of other easy class at harvard it's really interesting\",\"Great way to satisfy your Culture and Belief requirement.\",\"This course is really interesting and really easy.  You can never do any of the readings and show up to lecture and really enjoying the lecturing and learn something new and interesting.  You can tell the professor is really excited about the material and that makes the lectures really enjoyable.  The professor is also pretty funny.  And all you need to write the papers and study for the tests are the lecture notes - btw the lecture notes are super helpful both for following along in lecture and for study for tests and writing papers.\",\"Wonderful class to fulfill Culture & Belief. You really get what you put in. This class is very manageable if you just go to lecture and do the readings. You could certainly get by without doing the readings, but doing them allows for you to attain a much more thorough understanding of the material.\",\"great course!\",\"Coming from a non-religious background, I would say that this class is not as easy as one may think. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s probably a lot easier for those who come from a Christian\\/Jewish background. There isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t a lot of work in the sense that there aren\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t too many readings, but you still need to do them in order to prepare for the exam as the exam tests you on passages. There are a lot of course components: 2 papers, 1 Midterm, and a Final, so it can be burdensome throughout the semester. However, I really like how there is guidance with the papers in the sense that you turn in a draft before the final to get feedback from your TF. That was really helpful. Section is optional, but it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s probably a good idea to go as they go over the readings. Lectures are recorded, but you should attend lecture anyway as it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s quite easy to fall behind in this class. It was a pain catching up on all the lectures, readings, and defining all the ID terms right before the exam day in order to prepare. All in all, as long as you keep up with the material, you will be perfectly fine. And if you\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re interested in the topic, that will help a lot. For those who aren\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t so interested, it may be a struggle getting through the material. Overall, though, I feel like I have learned a lot and am able to carry a conversation about the religions and their differences to those with religious backgrounds.\",\"GREAT class!! I came into this class not knowing anything about the Bible, and I learned so much! Definitely a rewarding experience. Professor Cohen is great - super engaging lecturer who cares about the students. Same with the TFs - they're all really helpful and want you to learn and succeed. The essays were pretty short and fun to write, and the midterm and final are extremely fair. They tell you exactly what you need to know so there are no tricks.\",\"I loved this class, and it was a great way to fulfill culture and belief. Many people take it because it's easy and lectures and sections are essentially optional, but I'd recommend attending because the topic is really interesting. Everyone should take a course about the Bible at some point in their college career, and this one is essentially stress free (although you will have to study for the midterm\\/final).\",\"This class is incredibly slow and boring. The papers and exams are graded harshly as well. If you do not regurgitate what you have been told EXACTLY, you will be marked down. You can definitely learn some interesting things, but the class requires patience.\",\"Take a course because you are genuinely interested in the material, not just because its a \\\"gem\\\"\",\"It is known as a gem but there is actually a lot of material that is covered.\",\"An excellent way to fulfill one's culture and belief requirement.\",\"A good course to take if you have a few other very difficult classes.\",\"Blah, blah, blah it's an easy course. It's also simply amazing and brilliantly taught so take it! Professor Cohen is incredibly knowledgeable about the material but also makes it accessible to people who aren't as well-versed. One of the best courses I took at Harvard and I'm truly sad that I can't take some of Professor Cohen's other courses as I'm graduating.\",\"This is a pretty good class, although since section is optional and it's hard to pay attention in lecture, it is hard to learn that much.\",\"It is a gem.\",\"Take this course-- it's super chill, and you'll learn a lot. Challenge yourself in it and you'll get  a lot out of it.\",\"It is a great class if you put the work in and you can get something out of it too.  I learned a lot and loved my TF.  He was always more than happy to help me with any issues that I had.\",\"This is a great, informative, and relatively simple course to fulfill the C&B requirement. Professor Cohen is a great guy and takes great interest in his students' success.\",\"Amazing class. I learned so much with minimal work and did very well.\",\"It is not very exciting, but it is easy.\",\"The class is really interesting, go to lectures (or at least watch them)\",\"This class exposes you to religion from the point of view of a historian, which is extremely value just for general knowledge. It's not time consuming and has a great staff to take advantage of. It's a clear good choice.\",\"go to lecture\",\"Prof Cohen is pretty cool, not too heavy a course load. As far as a CB gen ed it's great\",\"It's really really helpful if you want to better understand religion, especially how Judaism and Christianity diverged.\",\"Painless way to fulfill CB requirement. Take with a friend if possible\",\"This class is great! Section is not mandatory but very helpful in preparing you for the exams. there are helpful review sessions before the exams-- basically telling you everything you need to know. lecture is very interesting! i feel like I've learned so much in this class especially because i had zero knowledge of any religion before taking the course. awesome class, definitely take it!!! the 2 papers are not hard at a llllllll.\",\"An interesting and easy course!\",\"CB23 is a great way to fulfill the Culture and Belief general education requirement. You learn a lot, and it is very pain free! Minimal work for maximum reward.\",\"This class sucks everything interesting out of studying the Bible. The professor is competent but is clearly worried that the class can't understand myth interpretation. Thus, he overgeneralizes and brings the class back to spark notes Jewish or Christian interpretation whenever any interpretation seems to be getting too particular or weird in its details. The problem is that the interesting things about different interpretations *are* their fine details, and by omitting these he leaves the class almost unbearably boring.\",\"This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Professor Cohen is the absolute man. Make sure you get to class a few minutes early to talk with him! 2 papers, midterm, and final. So many resources for you to do extremely well in this class. Very interesting too! TAKE THIS CLASS NOW. I am a Spring Senior saying this!\",\"Total gem. Do it. But don't get Deborah as a TF, she will destroy your grades.\",\"If Cian is still TFing the course, try and get into his section. If section is optional, GO.
