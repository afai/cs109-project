Instead, take it with patience and ease, and fully devote yourself to learning the material and perhaps more importantly the way of thinking and methodology which Professor Chamberlain introduces. It is a very unique and rare experience, yet if you are willing, you'll be surprised at how much you learn of economics and econometrics.","Chamberlain is super-smart and makes a lot of effort to think pedagogically about the class.

It's not worth taking, as you can learn the material much more effectively on your own.","If you need a basic graduate course in the econometric toolkit, there's nowhere else to go, so take this one.  Just don't expect to be wowed.","The class covers a lot of useful material, but at a very theoretical, abstract level.","takes time and is somewhat difficult but rewarding in the breadth and depth of knowledge gained","This course is said to be much, much better with Gary Chamberlain.

DO NOT TAKE!","Don't take it from Dale.","Do not take this course if you can avoid it.","The unlikely to recommend comes more from the teaching than the material (understanding econometrics is essential, but this class doesn't provide you with the knowledge you need any more than just studying it on your own. In fact, a lot of people used Chamberlin's notes instead of Jorgenson's to study.)","This class is terrible. Professor Jorgenson is a poor teacher, and you won't learn much from him (he actually makes things more confusing and econometrics more boring). He also teaches a very antiquated class that does not teach you much about modern technique. Exams are basically regurgitating large formulas and proofs from the homework, which are taken from the examples he does in class, so you won't learn how to apply the concepts you are taught beyond a few narrow problems. Do yourself a favor and go take the version from Gary Chamberlain, which is supposed to be a lot better. Otherwise, buy a copy of Hayashi and a copy of Wooldridge and learn from the books. Really the main value of the course is that it forces you to spend time working on econometrics on your own."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This is a good course to get an introduction to the theory behind econometrics.  I appreciated the effort to make it applied, as it brought several topics to life.  \r\nHowever, I did not fully understand topics by the end of lecture and often had to review the material on my own.  This was especially true in preparation for the exams, which we structured poorly in my opinion.  You are not allowed a cheat sheet for exams for this class, and I feel that I wasted lots of hours memorizing equations that I will always be able to look up when needed.  As well, previous exams were distributed, but solutions were not.  It felt almost like a trick - - why not distribute the solutions to enable better learning?","Take the class from Dale.  I have sat in on Chamberlain and Dale is a much better lecturer. He provides great intuition.","This is a challenging course.  To succeed in it you will need to devote a lot of time reading the books and supplemental material.  The lectures will help clarify the concepts but are not self-contained to be the primary or final sources of information on any concept.  Nonetheless, Professor Jorgenson is very supportive of his students and is willing to spend time inside and outside of class to discuss course topics and how students can best succeed in this econometrics course and throughout their career.","huge workload. if you dont spend 10 hours on the psets and 5-10 hours on revision per week you wont be able to follow if youre not a star at maths"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The approach to econometrics, and the inclusion of Bayesian inference, makes this an excellent introductory course.","The only reason to take this class is if you want a very deep understanding of a handful of Econometric concepts.

Prof. Chamberlain is extremely nice and the notes he provides are thorough.  You will need to go to section, however, to put the concepts together (which is fine).  Expect to work a lot.","It is not very easy; prepare to deal with long and complicated matrices.","If they can take econometrics anywhere else, they should.  This course is a lot of work for very little value-added.","It depends what you are trying to do. If you want to be an economist, you should take this class, even though it's a slog. If you don't want to be an economist, then you have a choice of several perspectives on statistics. I think the Economics perspective is a rigorous one, but others might feel differently.","Useful and necessary for students who want to do new work in econometrics or do thoughtful empirical work, but too theoretical for those who just want to do basic quantitative work in field like poli sci, policy, and even econ.","It's not the most fun course, but it teaches you to think about econometric problems in a structured, insightful way.","The class was helpful, but at times it was difficult to keep up with the material.","Take it only if you have to for your career","I thoroughly enjoyed the class: not only is the material interesting (there are these sorts of hidden connections between topics you cover), but the professor is also extremely friendly and helpful.  I found his office hours invaluable in terms of reviewing the material, and he is happy to spend as much time as needed to make sure you understand the material.  All in all, an excellent class.","Be prepared to work hard. It's not an undergraduate econometrics class anymore. You have to accept it and really dig into the concepts and methods, not just \"what are we using this for?\"","This is a course that every economist should take, no matter their prior level of sophistication in econometrics. Prof. Chamberlain's approach was eye-opening to me and provided solid answers to questions that I never knew I had.","This class is extremely difficult.

For those doing extremely applied work, taking 2140 and just learning to implement estimators might be sufficient, but in most cases I think the deeper understanding of how to model and derive results given by 2120 is worthwhile, though the course is more demanding.","Study it very hard because it is one of the last opportunity to study seriously econometrics!","My reservation in recommending this class would just be that it is very challenging and probably not worth the effort for someone not pursuing a very quantitative degree\/dissertation.","If you have any interest in econometric theory, you should certainly take this class; it is demanding but more than worth the effort, and I think it will be invaluable in preparing me for future research. I also think it's very useful for applied work (I'd recommend taking it no matter what), but 2140 is also an option for those who are more interested in just using these tools without necessarily fully understanding the derivations.","If you're looking to understand what econometrics is actually about, this is the course to take.","Gary is certainly one of the best professors I have had at Harvard - do not miss an opportunity to learn quite a bit of very useful and engaging material from him!","This is a great introductory theoretical base for any economist to build.
