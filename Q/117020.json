The tests are hard.","It's excellent to be aware of how the images you are constantly bombarded with in daily life function and to be critical of how they manipulate information and affect viewers.","This is a great class to learn about the history of photography.","This class is interesting and requires little concrete work (the readings are usually pretty light), but essays and tests are graded harshly.","I would tell them that if they can handle the intense jargon\u00e2\u20ac\u201cand obnoxious crit theorist namedroppers in section\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthat it's a relatively painless way to fulfill the Lit B core.","Prof. Kelsy is great and the lectures are quite interesting.  He's entertaining and makes the course enjoyable.  Also, I really enjoyed the material.  It isn't too much work either.","Until it works out the kinks subject-wise, I would hesitate to recommend the course as it is not really about photography theory like I had hoped.","CB30 was a fun and interesting class that expanded my views of photography and its historical significance. The class is great for visual learners and Professor Kelsey is passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the course material. However, the lectures can feel a bit long and packed with information, so students who have trouble paying attention in lecture should avoid this class. Furthermore, readings are not required to get by week to week, but necessary for exams, so less dedicated students will find themselves having to complete 1000+ pages of reading in preparation for the exams. All in all, I enjoyed the class and had a positive experience and would recommend it to everyone, granted they are proactive workers and capable of keeping up with Professor Kelsey's quick speech during lecture.","A really great class!","This is an excellent course that will actually give you insight into photography. It isn't just useless knowledge, you will actually learn about topics that can you later converse about in real life. Additionally, Professor Kelsey's lectures are extremely interesting.","lectures were really hard to follow, but the class had a light work-load and the project was fantastically enjoyable","Kelsey is a great professor and makes lectures so enjoyable because he knows how to teach the material. It was a very interesting course especially for those with an interest in photography.","It was an interesting class, but the assignments were difficult to understand, and should be improved.","lectures are really interesting, and the artists you're exposed to are great, but there's very little grounding in reality (esp during the modernism unit) and exams are very difficult","I think it's one of the most fascinating classes I've taken at Harvard.","Take this course but realize that the readings are not optional.","Going to lecture is both worth it and necessary to get a good grade without working really hard.","Photography is something that is so ubiquitous that we often do not consider its impact on the way our society functions and what it means about truth, time, law, family, and many other things. This course covers them all.","Cool class. Very history based which was a bit of a turn-off for me, but very informative. The information will stick with you.","Robin Kelsey is a gifted and enthralling lecturer, and genuinely cares about education and his students. The reading is relatively short and painless, and the assignments, too. Which is great, so you can focus on digesting all the awesome photos! I never appreciated visual aesthetic media before this course (I was always the antisy-est at museums), but now I can really look at a photo and sincerely find beauty in it. The feeling is SO RAD!","It is extremely interesting subject matter taught by a wonderful professor; the course's kinks will most likely be worked out over time.","This course, as interesting as it was, is NOT a painless way to fulfill a Gen-Ed requirement.  Speaking as someone with no background in photography going into the course, I found it a struggle.  This obviously cut down on my ability to enjoy the class.  With that said, Professor Kelsey is absolutely phenomenal.  If you have a background in photography (or want to take this class pass\/fail for non-Gen Ed purposes) I would highly recommend it.","The midterms and finals were unfairly hard.","The lectures are great and there isn't much work during normal weeks, but the exams are difficult.  On the whole, the whole idea behind the class can seem sort of artificial and insignificant, but it definitely makes for good cocktail party conversation.","It really helped me to be more critical of the images that are fed to us on a daily basis. It changed the way I look at advertising and press photography.","Do the reading and go to office hours. Also, don't multitask in lecture. let your mind wander and really look at the images presented. slurp coffee and go a little crazy if you have to. but focus and put yourself in the space of the image and you will see new things.","It is a great class, especially if you have a great TF like Maggie Gates.","If you attend lecture and take good notes, you can usually get by pretty well without having to do the readings, at least in the first half. In the second half the readings are a little more in depth, and it helps to stay on top of them. I found lectures to be a calming and relaxing learning environment and would highly suggest them.","Lectures are absolutely amazing. Readings can be long and unpleasant. If you're the kind of person who is irritated by humanities \"fuzziness,\" you will hate this course. If you're okay with a little bit of that, you will learn a lot.","It is really enjoyable!","Professor Kelsey is an excellent lecturer, and he presents a thoughtful argument on every topic. The class is a great introduction to photography and doesn't require any previous experience.","You should be interested in photography and comfortable with theoretical material to enjoy this course.","The readings are helpful when it comes to test time.  Do them, even if it just means skimming them for meaning.  Also, make sure you absolutely know which author said what, because that is absolutely necessary for the tests.","This course will make you a more literate viewer of photographs, but it will probably not change your life.","The class covered some very interesting topics, but was not cohesively structured and a little all over the place.","Writing assignments are vague and poorly explained\/guided. Lecture is very interesting, but taking this class for a requirement is difficult because you must already be able to think in a very (sometimes outrageously) abstract way about art interpretation.","The workload is light but the exams are really difficult.","It makes you think about pictures in a whole new way.","It's not for everyone, but if you think you might like an HAA course, take it. It's fun, it's informative, it's actually real world practical in a surprising way. It's not an easy core though.","I would tell them this class makes you really think deeply about art and you should be prepared for that.","If you're looking for an easy way to get rid of a gen ed class, this is definitely not your class.  If you're looking for an absolutely fascinating look at the way that photography and human history have interacted with each other, this is a great class for you.  If you're willing to work hard and you want to take a stab at art history and hear from a fantastic lecturer, this is a great class for you.","This course will change the way you look at photographs. You will always be entertained in lecture. There is not too much reading but the assignments are strictly (and fairly) graded.","This is the worst class I have taken at Harvard. If you like photography, run far, far away. It will make you doubt everything you ever liked about photography.","It's a good Core or Gen. Ed class, just some of the concepts would fly over your head, and the pace is extraordinarily fast. The final is difficult, and keep up with the readings, but pay a lot of attention when Professor Kelsey discusses them. Also, make study groups with your section - our section was particularly excellent at that.","This class requires a suspension of belief in many respects and often makes you question whether the images are just being analyzed for the sake of being analyzed. If you don't buy into the whole \"the light is coming from the right which implies....\" etc etc, do not take this class.","I think this course gives a great introduction to photography and its social impact. I have learned to read visual cues much better. This course has allowed me to understand the photographs around me better and has given me the tools to evaluate photographs critically.","Professor Kelsey is incredibly charismatic and a great lecturer. If you like photography, you will like the course. The new creative photographic project is a great addition and means that you can opt out of a research paper, which is a nice option to have.","YOU MUST DO THE READINGS!","This course is so interesting and fun to take. It teaches material that you normally would not think about. Also, the professor speaks very well and gives amazing lectures."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The lectures could be a bit dry at times, and the midterm and final exams proved to be a bit difficult.","too loosely structured","You would not believe how relevant the material of this course will become to so many other disciplines (biology, history, chemistry, geology, gender studies, etc). It will also help you learn not only how important images are in our society but also how to read them critically.","Keep up with the reading. It's easy to put it off because there's really no consequences for not reading each week. But at the end, you'll find yourself with a lot if you don't keep up.","it's a great way to fulfill a gened and learn about photography in a new way! do the readings - they're fun to read anyways. the photo project rocks","This course is amazing! I suggest anyone with even the slightest interest in photography or art to take it!","Overall it's a great class.  Professor Kelsey's lectures are good, the material is super interesting, and you'll definitely feel like you know a lot more about photography and art in general when you're done (I'm a CS concentrator, and I knew nothing of the sort coming in.)  It does get pretty artsy after the midterm when the class starts doing the more modern stuff, so watch out if you know your brain doesn't really work in that sort of way (mine doesn't).  There's a final project\/essay, as well as a final exam.  I feel like they should do one or the other, especially considering the format of the final - 6 half-hour essays.","I took this course as a senior, and it is one of my favorites.  There was just enough accountability that I kept up with the material and got a lot out of the class (section counts for a lot of your grade; it's really important to go to lecture because exams are open-notes), but the readings and workload were very manageable, and I never felt over-burdened.","This is an easy class if you pay attention and either go to class or review all the images and their photographers online after class. The final ended up being more serious then expected so make sure you make a good study guide. The final project was very doable and quite interesting, but make sure you start thinking of ideas right from the start because it creeps up on you. All in all, a very interesting class, especially (but not necessarily) if you like photography.","You can't go wrong with this class. It's one of the few Core\/Gen-eds I've taken with material that's just as substantive as what concentrators are reading. Lecture is truly unforgettable because Kelsey is just so good and the images you look at are so well-selected. Every lecture at Harvard could and should be this entertaining. Also, the course is \"easy\" in terms of workload, but it does so much with so little. I feel the class has changed me and made me more visually literate.","Readings are pretty important so that you aren't cramming before the midterm and to appear informed in section. That said, this is an awesome course. I feel like I see all images in a different light now.","This is an excellent course, grappling with photography's larger influence, which also provides a highly detailed introduction to a number of important photographers. Professor Kelsey is a very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and well-prepared professor.","This history of photography class made me really think about how the camera has evolved and changed our understanding of the world.  This is a history class that is quite open to interpretation, but provides a new lens for learning how the world changed and also provides new ways of viewing the current world.  Professor Kelsey is extremely insightful, funny, and very encouraging during lectures in hearing students' interpretations of the images he presents.  My section, led by Trevor, was one of the best sections of my life and acted as a forum for super interesting discussions about a ton of photographers and their visions.  You should really take time to do the readings because they become extremely important for both section discussions and exams, but they also really clarify lecture points. I enjoyed this class and recommend it to art history enthusiasts and students who want a generally painless but different class.","A solid class. Interesting material, good lectures, a great professor, and engaged TF's. I really enjoyed this class and the content of the course. Section was fantastic - I actually found it more enjoyable than lecture. It's not often you get to spend an hour on one photograph to discuss, engage with others, and puzzle out visual questions. The reading could be extrememly quick and easy or, more rarely, very complex and difficult to follow. Exams were also challenging. A great class all said.","grading is entirely subjective, exams are too long for the given time","This is a great course to take to fulfill the Culture and Belief requirement. While the workload is incredibly manageable, the topics covered in class are very interesting. Lectures and sections are very engaging, and Kelsey is a very entertaining professor.","This was the class I engaged with the most this semester. Very rewarding. Made me wish I had pursued a secondary in art history or VES.","Loads of reading, but interesting to gain a perspective on an artform.","If you enjoy photography and would like a creative outlet, this course and the substantial weight it places on the final project is perfect for you.","This class is awesome --the professor is really funny and quirky and the material is really interesting.  Trevor is the best section leader I've had in my four years at Harvard and section is actually useful and not a waste of time (rare at Harvard and even rarer for a GenEd).  The photography project is fun --this class makes a great elective or CB.","This class covers many topics in the history of photography and brings to your consciousness many of the important cultural photos that influence our pop culture.","Exams can be unstructured\/vague, but fine if you've done all the readings and can form well-supported arguments.","This class presents you a very interesting look at great photographs. However, the discussions in class and section are the most contrived I've seen in any class. Never have I rolled my eyes more at what the students, TFs, and even the professor have said about certain photographs. This class has completely went undermined the mission of the General Education curriculum in my eyes and has shown me that 90% of thought in humanities classes lacks any substance\/use.","Definitely go to all the lectures.","Good survey of the history of photography, and very easy to understand if you're not familiar with photography or art history.","This is a great class to take to fulfill your gen-ed requirements. You'll be surprised how widely applicable many of the insights are, and its really refreshing to have a class where you spend as much time looking at photos as text. Just make sure to learn how to write about art\/photos before taking the exams. In my experience, it was a different form than other humanities essays.","This course is great!  It is an especially great opportunity for students who are interested in visual arts but who are looking for something that will allow them to explore it a bit more.","Take absolutely ANYTHING that Professor Kelsey offers...","you should take this class if you're interested in learning how to interpret photography and put photographs in historical context.","This course is amazing. Professor Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer and does an effective job of engaging the class. He generates great enthusiasm for the subject material, makes wonderful connections between time periods, and really forces students to think and grow. Just know that we focus on Western photography.","Interesting but they ended up grading pretty harshly. and much better when you do the readings. Sometimes hard to catch the overall idea- found the layout of lectures hard to follow because it was only a series of about 30 pictures that we analyzed.","This course is a fairly easy Gen Ed that provides you with a good grasp on the major themes behind photography.  The lectures are interesting--you will actually want to go to them--and the photo project is a great alternative from a typical final research paper.","The course is delightful, and a wonderful introduction to art history (probably much better than HAA 10, in fact). Professor Kelsey is entertaining and engaging without being histrionic.","An interesting class. Be sure to take god notes, as they will be helpful on the exam.","I would definitely recommend this class as a way to fulfill the Culture and Belief Gen. Ed. requirement. You get the chance to look at and learn about a lot of photographs. I would also highly recommend, if you have any interest in photography, trying the photographic project for the final project, since it is a really cool way to fulfill a final project requirement.","The professor is a lot of fun and makes the class a joy to go to.","This class is a MUST. It is not too much work, and is VERY interesting.","The professor is amazing. Also, this course helps students to become well-versed in the history of photography and many of the big photographers, while also helping to sharpen their critical skills and see art and the world differently.  It gives students a new lens with which to observe the world.","There are better options out there.  It's an interesting topic, so if you need a culture and belief it's a fine choice.  But, just for fun, it's not worth it.","The class deals with interesting and important material in an engaging way.","Professor Kelsey is great, and the sections for this course were helpful and painless. But if you aren't interested in art history\/photography, consider taking a different course. This class double counted for my concentration and core, which is why I took it. I just found myself not interested in everything....there were some weeks, especially toward the end, when the material was great. But especially at the beginning, the topics can be dry.","Professor Kelsey is one of the best lecturers I've had at Harvard! He asks for audience participation so it doesn't feel like you're sitting there soaking in words being spit at you. Really great for people interested in talking about photography in an art history context!","Great way to fulfill Culture and Belief requirement, interesting course material, wonderful professor and teaching fellows.","Sometimes lectures are hard to follow along","One of t.he most engaging Core\/Gen Ed classes I've taken at Harvard.","The professor is excellent, and while the subject matter may be difficult to grasp sometimes, it is a history useful to have while analyzing photographs, especially in an age full of images.","This is probably my favorite class at Harvard. Prof. Kelsey is a wonderful lecturer - clear, engaging, and entertaining. The class is very well thought out: it's organized chronologically and each lecture focuses on a particular issue, artist or moment in the history of photography. There is not a huge amount of reading so it is easy to actually do all the reading (a rarity in many humanities classes!) and come to section prepared.","This is a great lecture course, featuring fascinating material that will change the way you look at images and think about photographs. Robin Kelsey is an amazing lecturer!","if you really like thinking about photography and are really curious about it's long history in detail, then it's a great class. i think of myself as interested in photography but i didn't know all that background about how photography evolved since its invention, so it's good knowledge to have. and you get to think about images in a complex, interesting way at the same time","Professor Kelsey is an excellent lecturer, and this is a great introduction to the major figures in the history of photography. If you've taken upper-level seminars and tutorials in the history of art, though, you will probably find this course very easy.","Readings could be more than a little boring at time, but it gives a good overview at the history of photography and the lectures are interesting for the most part.","Great lectures with interesting material.  Readings can sometimes be dense\/ confusing.  Both the midterm and the final are open book. It is nice to have the option of doing a creative final project rather than a research paper.","I think you should definitely take this class!  Professor Kelsey is an excellent lecturer and the material is very interesting.  The sections are also really well-taught, and so I've come away from the course feeling like I learned a lot about the history of photography.","If you don't like the artsy, abstract kind of thinking, don't take this class. If you must take this class, then make sure you do the readings because you need them for the exam.  If you speak up in lecture, be prepared to be told your observation is \"wrong\" in a roundabout way.  Honestly, find another CB Gen Ed class.","Robin Kelsey is a very engaging lecturer and I definitely learned a lot!","One of the classes that you'd not be bored at lectures at all.","This course is wonderful: the readings are enriching not just for those interested in photographic practice but also in photographic theory.","Really interesting subject, the lectures and section were both engaging and interesting. Covers a broad range of ideas that you would never have thought of before about photography, and the problems it faces with technology and representing the world."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Kelsey is a great professor and it was a joy to attend class. There are virtually no assignments except the project and the exams, which makes the class easy enough, although I loved the readings and feel like I got a lot out of the class.","An interesting class with good lectures! Not too much work outside of class, which is always good. Exams are funky though.","This class was incredibly awesome! It was probably my favorite class this semester. Professor Kelsey is absolutely amazing, and did an incredible job of making lectures interesting and engaging. Definitely, definitely recommend this class, not only as a gen ed, but just as an awesome experience.","It's a nice class to take. The photo final project is really interesting and rewarding.","I would tell future students that this course is truly inspirational and thought-provoking. It is not that easy for a Gen-Ed, despite stereotypes, so one should really be interested so that they are motivated to study for this course. In the end, an incredible course that I will never forget.","It is a great course about a creative subject, but unlike some courses on similar subjects, you actually learn a lot.","Painless gen ed.","This is a great class on photography. Kelsey is a wonderful lecturer, but the section component needs revamping before I can recommend it.","I enjoyed the class, but I felt that I didn't learn how to interpret or connect ideas the way the course intended. The course heavily weighs your ability to interpret, but doesn't really teach you how to do so.","There are a lot of readings that you can get away without doing week-to-week, but you'll end up trying to cram them in before the exams.  Section is pretty miserable, but a fair amount of the lecture material is interesting and Kelsey is a great lecturer.  I'm sure there are better C&B courses out there, but if you're at all interested in photo or art history, this class is at least worth shopping, but be aware that laptops aren't allowed.","Professor Kelsey is a great lecturer, there is a relatively low workload, and you get to produce a project of your own doing at the end of the year.  Overall, great way to fulfill the C&B gen ed, especially if you're interested in photography!","Great Culture and Belief. If you like photography, or even if you just want a well-taught survey of 19th and 20th century American and European culture, this course is well worth it.","Amazing lectures. Professor Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer. The photography project was an exciting and hands-on way to engage with the history, and a welcome break from traditional final paper assignments. We covered a huge breadth of material and history, and I learned a lot about social history through the history of photography because photography was so often a response to\/product of social and historical context. My TF Akili was a fabulous TF and really seemed to care about the material and the students, and showed a genuine interest in my project. Also, having the gallery installation specifically for our class was pretty cool. Great class, definitely made me smarter and more knowledgeable and exposed me to\/got me deeply interested in a really cool subject I previously had little interest in. Take it!","This class was certainly the best Gen. Ed. I've taken at Harvard--it's really interesting material, Professor Kelsey is a superb lecturer, and it also has a very low workload, making it easy to work around other more involved classes. I never wanted to miss lecture because they were always substantive, engaging, and well-delivered. I decided to take the class in part because of Professor Kelsey's professed philosophy of education, which was that a person should value it, and because of his strict ban of screens in lecture. I really appreciated his seriousness and clear dedication in both of those areas, and it was well worth it.","The lectures are incredible, and the readings are very fun. At times, the course felt like it was running low on conceptual material, and by the end it felt a bit redundant. You certainly learn a lot, and it isn't too challenging.","Lecture is very engaging, but the readings are about the opposite...photo project is a lot of fun and way better than a 10 page paper any day.","This class is great!! Definitely wish I had taken it back when it was open note, but generally SUPER interesting and engaging lectures that cover a wide variety of topics, painless assessments and the option to do a photography project instead of a final paper! Definitely take this if you're looking for an enjoyable Culture and Belief!!","The lectures were a bit dull, and the readings somewhat hard to grasp. Section was definitely interesting, but the exams are somewhat vague in what they expect from you.","Fantastic class, very interesting and enjoyable lectures, one of the best introductory classes I have ever taken!","Professor Kelsey is great lecturer and really does well with tieing in the readings into the lectures.","Professor Kelsey is awesome. If you're looking for an art history class that will open your eyes to the way photography has evolved and shaped the culture\/society around you, this is it. As far as GenEds go, this class gives you a chance for creativity and makes you think outside of the box. I loved this class and couldn't recommend it more!","This is a great class to learn about the various objectives that photographs have been used to convey.  This class will not necessarily make you a better photographer (it is titled \"A History of Photography\" after all), but it is still an enjoyable class to take.","CB 30 is a brilliant course if you have no background whatsoever in photography (practice\/history) as it traces very neatly several threads throughout history. However, given Prof. Kelsey's specialty (American photographic history), there's a conspicuous emphasis on American photography with European bits scattered here and there (such as the Soviet photomontage & Weimar Germany collage). If you are interested in modern\/contemporary photography more, I am afraid this course allocates very little time for post-1960's photographic practice, and it's a much better option to take Prof. Kelsey's Cold War Photography seminar.","Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer, and the lectures are paced and organized in a very interesting and effective way.  The photographic project is a great way to get your feet wet in photography.","The lectures are fantastic (do not be worried about not being able to use your comptuer to take notes!! You'd be surprised by how much you retain just listening and writing). Get Elizabeth as your TF! I heard that some TFs were subpar, but she is excellent!! My only reservation is the photo book project -- it is worth a lot. I took a risk doing it despite having no photography experience because the course heads said that our photography skills would not be evaluated, but when you hand in a photo book, no matter how ingenious or academic or well thought out your concept, TFs can only evaluate those photos. I had a much better understanding of the material than those photos may have communicated, and a three page reflection cannot do that understanding justice. If I had known the photos were be scrutinized, I would absolutely have written a paper. That said, definitely take this class! The work load is manageable and the material is interesting.","It's a very interesting class, but little artsy so be prepared to analyze photographs. You can't just do the reading, but do it. I didn't do it and had to study a lot for the final and the reading is also very interesting.","Interesting, good professor, a solid class.","This is a really interesting Gen Ed for sure. Though the lectures are a bit dry, the readings are really interesting and the photographers and photographs studied are amazing. The expectations for the exams are somewhat convoluted, but the final project is a great way to personalize this class to your views and interests. All in all, a really fun, not too tedious Gen Ed.","FAVORITE CLASS AT HARVARD. Minimal reading\/work besides tests and final paper. Get Elizabeth as your TF, she just gets it- so smart and runs section so well. Take this class.","The material can be interesting, but the course is overall too tedious to be really worthwhile.","If you want to be more cultured or want to learn more about art, this is the class for you! Really taught me how to appreciate photography. I also loved the history component!","The readings are fairly dry, and I think you have to be able to buy into some of the themes that occur in the history of photography even if you think they're just random.","Somewhat interesting; not the first class I would take in HAA.","This is a really interesting course that gives you a good overview of the history of photography. The lectures are fantastic and section can be as well (depending on your TF), but don't underestimate that amount of time and effort you'll have to put into this course to do well and really appreciate the material.","The professor is fascinating during lecture and his no-technology policy makes you focus during class. Sometimes exams can seem daunting and projects can seem unstructured, but overall, this course is interesting and fun.","I shopped this class for the past two years and was so excited to cap my senior year with a course I had heard such good things about - but it was such a disappointment and so unclear that I took it pass-fail, feeling even more frustrated as the semester progressed. This class is neither for novices of photographic analysis like me, nor for experts - by reaching neither group, it ultimately served no one. Expectations for student analyis were not explicit but unreasonably high on examinations. Lectures were scattered, superficial, and broad, and students were not allowed to use electronics as a further frustration to the learning process for those who take notes on laptops. Sections were a waste of time, without helping us develop our analytical techniques. This class was such a disappointment, and I hope Prof. Kelsey takes the time to revamp the course seriously in order to make it meaningful and really teach students how to look at a photograph and understand what to make of it, because I never learned that skill and it was my reason for taking the course.","Interesting class. Section was a bit on the annoying side. Lectures were great. Content was good but annoying to hear students give their opinions on it.","This course is probably a lot more historical than you anticipate; for me, that was cool because I enjoy learning about the groundwork and timing in addition to the art, but just know that the emphasis is equally on \"history\" and \"photography.\" There's a TON of information covered, which can be overwhelming, but by and large it's a really interesting class.","An ideal Gen Ed.  Low stress, high reward.  Hearing Professor Kelsey lecture twice a week is a treat, and the course really does make you think critically about the way that photography has changed over time and affected our understanding of the world.","It is a great GenEd course to fulfill culture and belief. The exams are a little difficult, but the readings each week is manageable and the photographic project was really enjoyable to do!","It's not a lot of work on a week to week basis but you need to do the readings and attend lecture to be prepared for section. The exams are tough so I wouldn't categorize this as an easy gen ed.","Robin Kelsey is a charismatic guy and also a great lecturer who points out insights that would be difficult to think of on one's own.","Don't wait until too late to start your final project or the last week of the semester will be extremely hectic.","I signed up for this course because it seemed like a pretty easy way to satisfy the Culture and Belief requirement and was about a topic about which I didn't know much. I'm so glad that I did. It was a low-stress, yet very interesting way to satisfy a Gen Ed by learning about something that relates to everyday life. The final project at the end of the semester let me put what I had learned to the test as I created my own photographic book. The teaching staff was encouraging and helpful. I wholeheartedly encourage you to take this course--it's a fun way to change how you think about the countless images that surround you at every moment of your life.","This class is definitely interesting and worth taking. Some of the reading gets a little heavy, but it all is definitely manageable. Professor Kelsey is an amazing lecturer, and the leaders of the sections are very helpful.","Wonderfully beautiful class!","A little more difficult than your usual Gen-Ed but very worthwhile. Really intriguing subject matter and Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer.","Many people wish to get their Gen Ed requirements out of the way as painlessly as possible, and for those students this is a class that isn't going to break your schedule. But I found the class very interesting and worthwhile in its own right and would encourage people to put some thought into their work, because I think this is really a class where what you get out of the experience is equivalent to what you put into it.","Probably one of the more interesting CB courses, but that's not saying much. The course is graded extremely subjectively with little justification for scores on papers and projects.","Go to every lecture! You'll be lost without it, but mostly go just because Prof. Kelsey is fantastic! Section can be frustrating, with a lot of people blabbering just to get participation credit. But if you're genuinely interested in art history and the context of photography, it's a great course!","This course doesn't have a lot of work per week and all of the lectures are pretty interesting. It has helped me to see photography in a very new way which is cool. The tests and projects, however, are pretty hard so keep that in mind if you are dying to get an A in this class","You should be very interested in comparative art and know how to write about it in order to fully enjoy this class. However, Professor Kelsey is very knowledgable about the subject matter and is a good lecturer.","This is a wonderful course and it's few weak points will almost certainly be rectified the next time it is offer thanks to ample efforts by the professor and TF's to gather student feedback. The material is really fascinating and a lot of fun to study whether or not you think you are interested in photography. It will really change the way you evaluate photography and art in general and Kelsey is a phenomenal professor","If you are at all interested in photography, take this class. It is superb. Professor Kelsey is a pretty engaging lecturer, but even if he's not jumping off the walls, he does such a wonderful job of organizing the course that you'll come out of each lecture with a strong understanding of the themes of the week and how they relate to other themes discussed throughout the semester. It's so easy nowadays to forget what an amazing, groundbreaking invention photography was in the 19th century, and this course is a fantastic way to explore how much it has evolved\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsocially, historically, artistically\u00e2\u20ac\u201dover the decades.","This is as good of an introduction to photography as you will get at Harvard. It is both expansive and really interesting, and I would definitely recommend it. Professor Kelsey is also fantastic. Some of the concepts are a little difficult, and the final photography project (if you choose to do it) is more work than it seems like it's going to be, so review material along the way and get started early on your project. Other than that, it's a pretty straight-forward course.","The midterm was graded harder than I thought, we'll see about the final.","A great class overall - the material is really interesting and the workload is quite relaxed. However, it does require commitment: lecture notes are not provided nor are lectures filmed, so you'll be left behind if you don't attend. I wouldn't recommend the class if you don't have at least some interest in photography and photographic theory.","This class is wonderful. Professor Kelsey is an engaging and knowledgeable lecturer. Just make sure that you are able to attend all of the lectures. If you miss class, it will be a lot harder to understand and recall some of the concepts that you will need later when analyzing the works presented in lectures during the exams. Secondly, going to lecture makes studying for exams (as well as taking exams) MUCH easier.","interesting and manageable material.  akili is a wonderful tf.  go to his section.  go to prof. kelsey's office hours--he's really fun to talk to!","Definitely a good class to satisfy the Culture and Belief Gen Ed requirement, especially if you are looking for something different. An interest in photography helps, as well as the ability to write and think critically. The readings do not take too much time. The final project, for which I did a photo album, was engaging and interesting.","This is an awesome gen-ed class, particularly if you're thinking about concentrating in art history. Its definitely not your easiest option for Culture and Belief, as there is a decent amount of reading, and some tricky theory that you can't expect to have encountered before in any other class. Regardless, the course is really well-run, and is really fantastic if you have any interest in photography.","If you have any interest in photography, this course is a great way to learn about its history and the factors that have shaped photography's progression.","Professor Kelsey can be kind of classic art-snobby at times but he certainly knows his stuff, and usually has very interesting, insightful commentary on the photos and themes in the class.  Minimal work load, don't need to keep up with the reading, tests are very fair and don't try to trick you, and the final photo project at the end is a great option.  I recommend this class for anybody needing a C&B gen ed without any hesitation, and if you enjoy photography, I'd take it anyway.","It's perfect to fulfill your Culture and Belief and is a lot of fun!","Excellent lectures, and exciting course material. The best class I have found for fulfilling Culture and Belief.","This is an awesome course, and a painless way to fulfill Culture & Belief. Professor Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer, and his \"no electronics\" policy in class is actually really nice if you buy into it - class becomes a kind of hour-long escape where you just get to look at pictures. With a midterm, project, and final, the workload is super light (you don't really need to do readings) and the class is interesting. You'll be amazed by how much photography can shape our lives.","It's a great class, and you really don't need any background in photography. Prof. Kelsey is a very engaging lecturer, and the reading load is not too heavy. Overall, a very enjoyable class.","It's a great gen eds. The lectures were very enjoyable, and the material is certainly interesting. I did not do most of the readings, but I definitely got by just fine, but do the readings if you are disciplined enough to do so. They are interesting and enjoyable reads.","This class is very manageable and interesting way to fulfill a gened. I truly feel satisfied with the new information I acquired about the history photography and the professor raised some compelling arguments about the development of photography. It is however ABSOLUTELY VITAL that you attend lectures and TAKE VERY GOOD CLASS NOTES ON THE SLIDES because hardly any information discussed in lecture is posted online, and only about half or less of lecture content is at all referenced in the readings.","Prof Kelsey is a great lecturer, the material is really interesting and the final project is very fun, during the semester not much work is required though you should definitely attend all lectures, the sourcebook is not worth the money and articles can be found online, and you learn a lot not only about the history of photography but also about events happening around the world between the early 1800s to today, sections are mixed between year levels so you can meet people outside of your class which is cool as well.","The only lecture in all of Harvard College that consistently keeps me awake and interested. Even at 10 am.","This was an excellent class, and even though they don't claim to present a survey of the history of photography, to me it was pretty comprehensive and most of my favorite photographers were covered. You get a real sense of the role photography played throughout history since its invention, as well as the effect of historical events and changing social climates on photography itself. The lectures are excellent, the readings are really interesting, and I'd recommend this class to anybody.","I would say that I was somewhat disappointed by this course.  This is not like a typical HAA class which I was expecting.  I feel like more emphasis was put on the readings than the actual photographs we were looking at.  Readings are very dense and the exams demand a lot","Pretty interesting course material with an enthusiastic professor. The topics sometimes felt disjointed from lecture to lecture and readings were pretty hit-or-miss, but overall a good gen ed class. The final project is a cool opportunity if you don't have photography experience.","Fun, easy way to take care of that pesky CB gen ed requirement. You get to learn about how photography has taken up different roles in society and cap it all off with the opportunity to put together a photographic final project.","The lectures in this class are fairly interesting, and they build to some pretty important implications about the way our society functions. It was also a good overview of the technological changes that enabled photography's role within society to become what it is today. That being said, it was not at all conceptually satisfying, and sections were completely awful. My TF seemed totally uninterested in whether or not anyone was learning from the conversations. We barely discussed how photography fits into the rest of art history, and if you know anything about art, you'll probably find the class less than satisfying.","The best CB you can take by far! Kelsey is a wonderful, wonderful lecturer, and you learn about photography in a way that will last you long past the course. Take it.\r\n\r\n[I also took Art and Thought in the Cold War, and Jazz, Culture, and Freedom- if you like either of those two courses, you will love this one.]","This course is so worth taking, if you can get a good TF. If you want to take it, I would be very attentive to your TF for the first couple of weeks and transfer quickly if it isn't working out. Also, know that the TFs do all the grading, so your grade is essentially in their hands, not Prof. Kelsey's.","TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Kelsey is brilliant to listen to, and Elizabeth is an amazing, knowledgeable TF. This class changed the way I view the world, and how I think about photography and its role in society. You also learn important skills like situation analysis, communication (both verbal and written), and critical thinking. So far one of the best classes I've taken here. \r\n\r\nThe readings aren't long at all (<30 minutes a week), and it's possible to procrastinate on them and catch up before the midterms\/finals. However, it's better to stay on top of the assignment, as it'll add more to your experience in section. \r\n\r\nGO TO LECTURE! DON'T MISS OUT ON PROFESSOR KELSEY!","The lectures and material are generally very interesting and the amount of work you do from week to week is very minimal, other than the exams and the project. However, the section component of this course becomes really tedious, with people just making things up the whole time. Because of that format, there is really no incentive to keep up with the readings. Prof. Kelsey is great though!","The lectures are great. Professor Kelsey is really passionate about his work. Be careful about the teaching fellows because I believe that can really make or break your experience in this course.","This class was extremely interesting and informative. Definitely one of the most interesting culture and belief classes. You do not have to necessarily do the readings though, for the exams as well as for sections, they do help in the overall analysis of the pictures and content. The final photographic project option was a nice divergence from the norm of writing papers and allowed more creativity than is typical for a harvard gen ed.","TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN ART AT ALL. Professor Kelsey is a fantastic lecturer and I came out of each lecture with my mind blown. There are so many connections and historical relationships that can be observed through the camera lens that we never stop to think about.","Definitely one of the best courses I've ever taken, and I'm a senior. Professor Kelsey is an unreal lecturer with intriguing perspectives to teach, and the whole course is an enjoyable trip into the world of photography, if you're willing to engage with it!","The class is very interesting, but also comes with reading that at times is lengthy. However, the material and professor are well worth the hours spent studying. Overall, it makes one feel smarter and gives you great skill at analyzing art at it's core.","This class is very interesting, but do not take it just for an easy A. Although you won't have too much work during the semester, the midterm and project are graded very subjectively and you will not know how you are doing until the very end when it's too late.","Good lectures, but the TF can make or break the class.","Low stress and very interesting. Lectures were a pleasure. Grading was a bit arbitrary on the exams.","Lectures are engaging and an effective use of time. At times sections were onerous and not particularly enjoyable.","This class is an excellent introduction to the history of photography. The lectures are incredible, and Professor Kelsey is really passionate about the material.  However, be careful about which TF you end up with- grading varies widely between different sections.","Great lecturer, interesting material. Shop the first couple lectures, and that should give you a good idea on whether you want to take the class.","The final project is great! Interesting class, but lectures don't always flow in a cohesive fashion.","A unique opportunity to learn about the photographic medium. Readings are varied and do not take too much time, and the final project is a unique opportunity to do a photographic project. Would definitely recommend.","This class is the most informative class that I have taken at harvard yet. From start to finish this class was really engaging. The lectures were incredibly interesting and so were the sections. The readings each week were fascinating and they were not too long as well. I really enjoyed learning about photography and I want to continue to learn about it","It is an excellent way to fulfill a difficult category of Culture and Belief, although content and readings can be slightly lengthy or contain advanced content, the class offers a great environment for learning about art and history.","Great way to fulfill Culture and Belief Gen. Ed. It helps to be interested in history. But even if you aren't I think the course would prove interesting.","This is a pretty easy class that has very interesting material.  Prof. Kelsey makes lectures very engaging.  There isn't a lot of work outside of the final project, and the midterm and final require a lot of memorization but are not that bad.  I took it pass\/fail, but probably would have ended with a pretty good grade anyway.","Second half really interesting. A lot of long readings that seems unnecessary and tedious.","You dont know how the midterms\/final are going to be like. The professor is great and the material is interesting, but it is very unclear what they expect from you on tests.","Professor Kelsey is an amazing lecturer and the material is incredibly interesting. Also, the readings are reasonable and relatively easy, and there is very little work required to stay on top of things. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in photography!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.85","workload":"1.58","difficulty":"2.66","recommendation":"3.99","enrollment":"169","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 30","course_id":"1945","cat_num":"5649","1s":"1","2s":"8","3s":"39","4s":"73","5s":"34"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 30","course_id":"1945","cat_num":"5649","1s":"7","2s":"47","3s":"93","4s":"7","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CULTR&BLF 30","course_id":"1945","cat_num":"5649","1s":"73","2s":"75","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
