'07":{"comments":["a fun and painless math class","I'd take them to take it because it is a nice change from the normal math class where the professor lectures the whole time and things go over your head and you're too scared in lecture to ask. In this class, you are not scared or feel intimidated to ask a question.","fun math class","If the class is with Bret, go for it!","If you want an easy course, this is for you.  But don't expect to learn anything.","Get to know Bret, he's awesome.","I would tell students that this class is very enjoyable, and that they should take it if discrete math is something they could use in their concentration.","Bret Benesh is outstanding.","Attendance is important.","Do not take this class if you are a serious math major and planning to take Abstract Algebra.","It's fun and easy.","for a senior, it's a great review of some past concepts, while approaching them from a new perspective"]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["If you like a lot of busy work and teaching yourself a lot of material, sign up!","It's a rewarding class, but it's alot of work.","The workload isn't that bad and you learn about a lot of cool math topics.","Good way to satisfy applied math requirements.","Take this course only if you are willing to put in a lot of work on content that very few other students know about\/understand.","Teaching the material you are trying to learn is a fun and unique experience.","I found it strange but in a very good way. I loved the material and have come away understanding it better than I have understood any math class since coming to harvard. There were lots of moments that made me feel like I had accomplished something and really made a breakthrough in understanding. \r\n\r\nAll of that being said, it's important to know that this class has a _lot_ of extra work on top of hw. It's a pain and takes time but if you really do it you'll learn a lot and in retrospect I'm glad I had it.","Take the course when you have ample time","Icosahedra were never this cool before.","It is a good class and you learn a lot. Be prepared to work."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["For me, this class was a lot of work. You have to do a problem set and teach a concept every week since its a \"student taught\" class. Professor Hall does sometimes teaches some of the material and the times he does, I always understand it because he is an awesome lecturer. However because students are teaching other students most of the course (though they have to go over their lesson with the professor beforehand), teaching quality varies across student to student. Quizzes were fair, final was kinda difficult for me personally. Despite the work, I feel as if I did learn a LOT about groups, fields, rings, etc. and this class was a nice introduction to discrete math. This class is more like a general overview of a lot of topics rather than going in depth about them (my friend who is a math concentrator, after looking at the syllabus, says that we don't really delve too much into group theory.) Overall, I recommend it! Professor Hall and Adrian are super nice!","The resources in this course are great. Professor Hall and Adrian are always willing to meet, even outside of their office hours, to help you. For those of you who have the attention span of a fly, all lectures are videotaped and posted online. \r\nThis course is similar to a seminar. There are about eight students in my class and all the lectures are presented by students. So there is an active participation component.","This was a great way to break out of the 21 series and learn some proofs. It wasn't particularly challenging or time-consuming. I gained a lot from preparing to present proofs to the class.","Great introduction to proofs with a unique seminar style, really depends on fellow peers but this dependence works.  Lots about groups and abstract algebra and not really about graph theory"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Some busy work but you learn some really interesting math that underlies a lot of the stuff you already know. If you like math and just think it's cool to think about you'll love this class","Very enjoyable, fun, and easy math course.  Great way to be exposed to multiple areas of abstract math while learning how to present math.  If you did well in 23+ maybe consider 122 though for a more serious introduction to group theory.","Take this course! Paul is an endlessly interesting professor. You will come out of this course having learnt a variety of topics in surprising depth. Not very challenging, but very interesting nonetheless. Good second or third math class. Covers very important mathematical concepts.","This class is an extremely good introduction to higher-level math topics. It gives a very good overview of group theory (as well as many other important topics). It is taught seminar-style, with students presenting topics at the board during class, so be prepared to not sit and be lectured, for better or worse. The class is small and moves at whatever speed is appropriate for the students. Paul will often include or exclude topics depending on what the class wants. Midterms and final are very fair, and problem sets are very reasonable. If you've only taken Math 21 (or not even that), have no proof experience, and are considering higher-level math courses or a Math\/AM concentration, this class is perfect.","Fantastic way to fill Applied Math requirement","This class is great. If you're a little hesitant about taking a math class and what that's all about this is the class for you. The pace is set by the students but that doesn't mean the class isn't demanding and rewarding. It is challenging but accessible. Classes are engaging and instructive. One of my favorite classes at harvard so far.","This is a great chance to learn in a small, seminar style environment some interesting, new, but not overwhelmingly difficult, material in abstract\/discrete math. Also you get practice presenting on the whiteboard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"15","response rate":"73.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 152","course_id":"2871","cat_num":"8389","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 152","course_id":"2871","cat_num":"8389","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 152","course_id":"2871","cat_num":"8389","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
