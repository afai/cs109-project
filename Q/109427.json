Afrikaans is a delightful language to learn - it's incredibly simple grammatically (no verb conjugations, very regular structure, barely any tenses, and no declensions), it shares a lot in common with other Germanic languages (especially Dutch, which has approximately 95% of the same vocabulary), and it's fun to speak! Regarding the class itself, the course was very fun, and we learned quite a bit of useful vocabulary, but I think the difficulty level and workload could be ramped up significantly. It's not easy at all to try and speak Afrikaans outside of South Africa, so in-class time is basically the only chance you get to practice. This was the first time Afrikaans was offered, so it might change a fair bit in the coming years, but overall I think the course could have benefited from more speaking practice and a higher level of difficulty, as well as a more rigorous workload. (I know I may sound masochistic here, but really, it does help!). It was great fun though - take Afrikaans if you want to go to Cape Town, or even if you're just looking for an interesting and relatively simple Germanic language to learn.","This was a great introduction to African languages and the AAAS department. Lynn was fantastic and I encourage anyone interested in South Africa to take the class. She invites conversation about South Africa's problems and is very upfront about what the situation is like. This class will give you an unfiltered account of South African life while engaging you in a unique learning experience. Make sure to ask Lynn to have a cooking day! It was the best day of class."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is an awesome course with an awesome instructor!","This class is absolutely amazing!  If you want to learn a language and have fun at the same time, this is the class for you.  I have learned Afrikaans at a much faster rate than other languages I've taken at Harvard of in high school.  The teacher makes learning the language fun and easy. However,  she covers a large amount of material so that you are proficient at a basic level by the end of the course.","This class is fantastic! Lynn is the best and you learn a huge amount without feeling overwhelmed.","Afrikaans is the best language you can take at Harvard. Lynn is an absolutely terrific teacher who sincerely cares about her students. You are never overwhelmed but you are consistently learning and do come away with an impressive amount of language ability after even one term. If you are interested in South Africa, take this class. If you need to get that foreign language req done, take this class. You'll thoroughly enjoy it and learn lots without any pain in the process!","This course was a lot of fun. It didn't take up much time during the week and I always left the class feeling enthused about Afrikaans and my next visit to South Africa. Aspects I enjoyed most were reading children's books and discussing current events in South Africa with the class and teaching assistant."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Afrikaans is a terrific course. Lynn is a fantastic teacher and also a lovely person. The workload is completely manageable and you really just have to study for the exams and quizzes.","Great class","It's an excellent course, not overly difficult and there is not a heavy workload outside of class. It's a great opportunity to learn more about South Africa and the teacher is extremely personable and responsive to students."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["All this course needs is a bit more organization. That said, Lynn is a terrific teacher and Afrikaans is a fun and laid back way to learn a language.","This course is a wonderful way to continue your Afrikaans education. Lynn is a phenomenal teacher. She works to make the class fun for students and makes it easy to learn."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"33.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 90r.a1","course_id":"10628","cat_num":"97322","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 90r.a1","course_id":"10628","cat_num":"97322","1s":"2","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 90r.a1","course_id":"10628","cat_num":"97322","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
