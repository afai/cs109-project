It was a lot of funning learning about medieval swedish culture and the films we watched were incredible.","I found it a bit frustrating that we didn't go over the errors that we made on our exams, and thus didn't solidify the rules that we weren't clear on before the next exam (where we would likely make many of the same mistakes and keep losing points). Other than that, it was a fairly low-stress class with a lot of interesting readings about death in different genres of swedish literature. I personally didn't get very much out of the component where we had people present their novellas, because it was just kind of confusing to hear about the books and not actually read them. I think it would make more sense for all of us to read like three of them and then be able to all talk about them in the class.","SVERIGE","This class is great!","This course is a fun way to engage with Swedish literature and culture."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SWEDISH Bbr","course_id":"2144","cat_num":"3405","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SWEDISH Bbr","course_id":"2144","cat_num":"3405","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SWEDISH Bbr","course_id":"2144","cat_num":"3405","1s":"4","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
