I would not recommend it, however, to someone who simply needs to fulfill a language requirement. It is a fascinating language, but it can be difficult for speakers of Indo-European languages (especially ones like English, that do not have a robust case system and lots of verbal inflection) to learn a Semitic language for the first time and to start learning how to read cuneiform script too.","If you are not a highly skilled language learner, I encourage you to take this course in a semester when it can be your primary focus."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"4.25","recommendation":"3.75","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AKKAD A","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"4891","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AKKAD A","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"4891","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AKKAD A","course_id":"3706","cat_num":"4891","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
