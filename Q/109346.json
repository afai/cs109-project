Well make you understand how to read a circuit diagram.  It won't teach you exactly how a computer CPU works but you will understand how memory (RAM ROM) works.  worth taking","The best non-physics physics course you'll ever take!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Excellent course! Covers a lot of material very quickly, but in an engaging way.  Takes a lot of time (4.5 hours twice a week in lab plus readings outside of lab) but is well worth it.  The knowledge gained\/work ratio is very high.","I learned a ton, but the class took way more time than it should have because of unnecessary things such as vague wording in lectures and texts. The labs, which took a huge amount of time, would have been unnecessary if lectures were taught more clearly. The micro section was interesting, but probably will be completely useless for me.","You will learn a tremendous amount about electronics but you will also spend a lot of time each week on this course. It is incredibly valuable but you will work for it.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time in lab and reading, but it's worth it.","If you want to learn electronics for any reason, Physics 123 is THE class to take.","This course requires a lot of time, but is definitely worth it!","This is a great class for getting a comprehensive overview of electronics in one semester. As such, it takes up a lot of time and can be frustrating. The teaching staff are very helpful and eager to help out with any issues you might be having."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The workload is quite intense. I basically had to dedicate 4 days a week to this course (classes, homework, studying) but in the end it is amazing to see how much one can learn in only one semester. For me definitely worth it.","The labs are lengthy, but you learn a lot, and they're pretty fun. Like just about anything, the more time you can put in, the more you will learn. I think the SiLabs at the end are probably more useful in the long run than building the big computer, even though building the big computer seems to be more popular. Going to the homework\/review sessions helps a lot on the homework.","Physics 123 may be the most misleading course title I have ever seen. It neither teaches physics, nor is it as easy as counting 123. However, if you want to gain a great foundation in analog and digital electronics, this class is the best way I could possibly think of.","This is easily one of the best courses I have ever taken.  A must for anyone who will ever work with electronics."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a very useful class, especially if you are interested in getting a working knowledge of electronics, at a level that allows you to understand the inner workings of electronic circuits."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"6.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"40.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 223","course_id":"5323","cat_num":"97765","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 223","course_id":"5323","cat_num":"97765","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 223","course_id":"5323","cat_num":"97765","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
