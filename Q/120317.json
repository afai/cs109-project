Good class!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["One of my favorite classes at Harvard. A real chance to learn a highly useful skill.","A great class, well worth the work.","A great class to take if you are interested at all in policy.  You definitely do not have to be an engineering student to take the class.  I thought the class was a lot of fun.","Wonderful class! Sumeeta is a fantastic professor who cares about her students. You can redo labs until you do them properly, and can get points back for doing so. The final project at the end is a good chance to realize how much you really have learned. You learn to think of the world differently, in a much more spatial manner, and it's more important than you'd think.","Its a lot of time commitment","Things are pretty interesting throughout the course, but got a lot more fun once work started on the final project.  Really put work into it, and get help from the teaching staff -- they are awesome.","Great! You learn so much about ArcMAP and GIS and Sumeeta is amazing!!","I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental science or the quantitative social sciences. You'll be amazed at the power of spatial analysis.","This is a great, and useful class. Sumeeta is helpful and very laid back. Highly recommend."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.41","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.24","recommendation":"4.41","enrollment":"18","response rate":"94.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 103","course_id":"1329","cat_num":"9277","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 103","course_id":"1329","cat_num":"9277","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"11","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 103","course_id":"1329","cat_num":"9277","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"9","4s":"4","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
