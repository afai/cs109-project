You gain a lot of practice in reading papers and thinking about how to solve problems.  Also the material is quite different from most of the other classes so it is very interesting.","Very interesting class, but only for those already really passionate about biological mechanisms in general or genetics in particular. Also, if you only like courses that are highly structured and offer objective assessments, do not take this class."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class was absolutely fantastic. I loved the dynamic in the classroom, and while sometimes I personally struggled with some of the topics and how to understand the experiments, I feel like the professor was very patient and willing to help me whenever possible. I learned a lot from this course, and I know that I will come out with a more in-depth knowledge of not just \"chromosomes\" as a broad topic, but details that can be applied further. While this may seem like another paper-based course, it's really much more than that and is a course I'd recommend highly.","This course is great - Professor Kleckner inspires interest and a desire to learn about a topic that is very important in MCB but often overlooked."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is really a must take for anyone interested in cell biology, genetics, biophysics, or a mixture of any of those three. From your general cell biology or genetics course you may think that the dynamics of chromosomes is an open and shut case (think 30 nm fiber). However, this class will show you that it is anything but shut, and rather, we are just beginning to appreciate the complexities of chromosome dynamics. Furthermore, this is your chance to use Harvard to its fullest and get a chance to learn from one of the leaders in the field, Nancy Kleckner. Her knowledge of the material and experience in the field are at some times even overwhelming, but it means that you will come out of this class a more informed biologist.","This class is a great break from the grind of introductory and intermediate level biology courses because it's small and journal-club style with some lectures instead of memorization of various pathways and proteins.","Great class. So amazing to speak with a renowned professor with so few other students."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 188","course_id":"3563","cat_num":"8561","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 188","course_id":"3563","cat_num":"8561","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 188","course_id":"3563","cat_num":"8561","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
