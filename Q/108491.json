Also, Leah is phenomenal, and the work that she carries out throughout the semester is very interesting","Joining the Somerville lab has been by far one of my best experiences at Harvard. Professor Somerville and all lab members are extremely supportive and always willing to help out and share their knowledge and experience. They're a very young, lively group of people with a passion for developmental cognitive neuroscience - there's so much to learn from them!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2160r","course_id":"4309","cat_num":"23846","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2160r","course_id":"4309","cat_num":"23846","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
