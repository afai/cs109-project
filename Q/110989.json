Usually the people who take 21b like math a lot more than the people who take 21a, so the curve on the tests is higher, but the atmosphere in class is more positive.

Some of the topics are very interesting and virtually all have applications in a number of fields, so it is a very useful course to take. Due to the way it is taught in sections with homework due every lecture, Math 21B is not exactly the most fun class, but it teaches you what you need to know at a high level and fulfills a standard prerequisite for many higher level courses.","Go to section.  It's easy to get overwhelmed if you don't stay on top of your work.  Also, if you have any commitments on Monday nights, do not take Tuesday-Thursday section times because you will have 2 homeworks due on Tuesday mornings.","If you think you might even have the faintest chance of liking math (and not just fulfilling a requirement) then don't take math 21a\/b but math 23 or 101.","There is a significant amount of work to this class.  However, it provides a very complete look at linear algebra, including more theoretical topics as well as practical application.","Make sure you do the homework and read the book.","This is not an easy A, but with a moderate amount of studying, this will prove to be a nice course: do not start your problem set an hour before it's due.","Take 23 or 25 or 55.

The material is in my opinion more useful than multivariable calculus.","Only take this if you have an idea what it covers and are genuinely interested.","For those not in math, physics, or engineering, Math 21a and 21b are a great way to finish up your math education and learn about all the more interesting and theoretical possibilities in higher-level math. They might also spark an interest in a math concentration, although they didn't for me (not because 21a and b were boring, just because other classes were more interesting personally).","Do your homework.

Perhaps take it with a different professor than Knill, if another professor offers it.","The course is too stressful for what it's worth; the lessons are taught at a decent level at the beginning, but then begin to become unclear and insufficient as soon as the material gets tougher; what's more, most of the class seems to revolve around \"learning it yourself\" through homework, MQC, and asking questions at office hours or problem sections, rather than actually learning the material in class; midterms threw the learned material back at us at a much higher level; the course seemed to be littered with various applications that were not only confusing but did not substantially add to the understanding of the material","This would be the best class for science students to take.  The applications of linear algebra to the sciences are endless.  The non-theoretical approach may not appeal to mathematics concentrators.","This will be really tough and fairly rushed, especially towards the end with Fourier Series. Do not take this course unless you a) really love math or b) really, really need to take this course to satisfy a concentration requirement.","Not as hard as Math 21a.  Especially for those who had no previous experience in Multivariable calculus because in 21b, much less people have had previous exposure as with 21a.","Take it if you want to complete your math background.","If linear algebra isn't your thing, be prepared for a difficult semester.","The beginning of the course may seem easy, but continue to pay attention because material can begin to go over you head quickly if you are not prepared for it.","This is a much more practical math class than most.  Although you probably won't be using linear algebra in every day life, it applies to life much better than most math subjects (like multivariable calculus).","Reading the textbook is the most useful of anything you could do in this class.","it's a little difficult in the beginning because it's new, but then when the final comes around I think everything falls into place.","You need to learn the material on your own time. The homework is just obligatory; it doesn't help. There are a slew of other books that will help more than the Bretscher book. Linear Algebra is, however, very important to learn so it's useful to take this class to motivate you to learn the material properly.","If not interested in high level theory or proofs, this is a great course to take for linear algebra.","It's relatively light-load if you settle for a superficial understanding of the material.","Be wary of the lack of helpful instruction","Make sure that you study for the exams to do well on the exams. Doing well on Prof Knill's exams doesn't always mean understanding the material in a generally deep way. It does mean knowing several of the tricks that he likes because he thinks that they help make deep points about the material.

You learn a lot of material, although at times is feels very theoretical. If you do not like a lot of theory, consider taking AM21b.","Cool and useful, more fun than Math 21a. John Hall was a great and caring teacher","I would recommend this class to people who have the time to devote to this course and are excited about the material.","This class is actually very interesting, albeit a bit confusing at times. The only part I would say I didn't enjoy is that it's very computation-heavy, but it's necessary to learn.","The math 21 sequence has been one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.  The staff is passionate and accessible. You learn beautiful, interesting, relevant material, and they provide the resources for you to do it.  Sure, most people are taking this class as a requirement or prerequisite, but at the end of the day: 1. you need to know this stuff, and 2. you actually learned a ton in this class. The only people who complain about this class are people who wouldn't like the material any way it was presented.","I didn't find the course as satisfying as 21a, because the topics from day to day felt disjoint. It's not until the end that things begin to all connect, which is rewarding, but it's very easy to feel lost along the way. Especially while you're doing true\/false questions.","do the worksheets and readings on the website, they help a lot more than what is taught in section","It's a great introduction to linear algebra, but does not focus as much (or teach as well) the portion on differential equations.","This course is largely dependent on your TF, and it was a nightmare for me personally. If you're a fan of computation, this may not be the course for you. It's based on a lot of terminology that may be difficult to visualize, but with resources like MQC, you can do well in the class. It was a complete snooze fest for me though, and that definitely affected my performance. Only take this class if you need it for a concentration requirement.","Shockingly well taught, take it instead of applied! The worst part about this course is that the material is interesting and you'll want to know why it's true, but this class really isn't about the \"why\"","21B has great application in many upper level courses. So I'd highly recommend that you take it.","dont take it","It's a lot of work (3 problem sets per week can take up a lot of time) but if you pay attention in class and go along with the worksheets they give you then it shouldn't be too difficult. Take the practice tests before the midterm and final and you should be alright.","If you do not know any linear algebra, you should take this course as it is a great introduction to the material and will give you a good foothold for other math or applied math courses at Harvard.  If you are familiar with some topics of linear algebra, you should skip this and go into AM 106 or AM 120.","I'm a mechanical engineer and I took this course because I started in 1b, so I was offset by a semester and could never take the applied 21 classes. However, I have no regrets! John Hall taught this class really well, and I feel like I now have a much better understanding of matrices and differential equations. Though the class went into topics that were difficult to conceptualize, there was plenty of material that could be applied to real-world problems. Though having three PSets a week is a giant pain, you will leave the class with a wonderful work ethic and understanding of linear algebra. Don't miss out on this class!","If you are more of an applied person like myself I would recommend applied 21b over this class.","Keep in mind that there are three problem sets a week and each will probably take about 3-4 hours to finish.","The exams are fairly difficult and expect a mastery of the material. Also, the three PSets a week take a significant amount of time out of your week.","The p-sets are actually interesting!","You don't need to take 21b for most concentration requirements, so don't make the same mistake I did. That said, this is an excellent course for those who want to grasp basic linear algebra and ODE concepts, taught by a professor who knows how to give a straightforward lecture.","Lots of work but fun.","I really love this class. It kinda made me fall in love with math again. It's not that hard if you like math and are really engaged. I would definitely take it, even if you feel a little intimidated. There are lots of opportunities for help.","This course is absolutely terrible.  The teaching is done so poorly you'll wonder why you even bother going to section.  The abstract material is a focus of this class so if you plan on going into science or engineering this will be a waste.  The teaching staff has members that have clearly never taught before and should never teach again.","The problem sets absolutely suck but they got me to really learn the material.  Beginning of the class was really theoretical and difficult to follow but I learned a lot from it. Definitely recommend taking this class if you are willing to put in the work.","This math class is interesting and well-organized.  It seemed fairly well-taught in all sections this fall, but things might be different in the spring when there are more sections.","This was by far the worst course I have taken at Harvard. The subject material was not difficult, but it was presented in a terrible fashion which led to me having to teach it all to myself after section. The structure of the course was horrible and I truly regret not waiting to take Applied. Left a bad taste in my mouth for the math department.","John Hall is awesome! This class does a great job of teaching the material and you get the help that you need. The material is very intriguing and applicable in many fields. Definitely take it! Lots of work but worth it in my opinion. Sometimes I felt like I learned the material but would struggle a bit on psets and exams, but I really felt like it was worth it.","This is an extremely theoretical course; it is very hard to visualize what is happening with transformations and whatnot, which is very different than 21a. You will learn a lot from this class, but be prepared to work hard and have your brain hurt. Also you will learn very quickly that true or false questions are not good things. Not at all.","Solid standard course.","If you can take the Math 23 track it is much more worthwhile than Math 21.  Math 21b is a nice class but it does not teach you how to prove anything.","Linear algebra is a lot of logical reasoning--if you don't like matrices and derivatives\/integrals, it's probably not the class for you.","This is one of the most useful and applicable math classes you will ever take - which seems strange since it is billed as being \"more theoretical.\"  But really! You learn the actual calculus and geometry behind a lot of computer science functions and statistical analysis, and - though the homework is copious - it really makes you practice those techniques.","It's a requirement for some concentrations, so you likely have to take it. The course is incredibly well taught with lots of resources to help you, but 3 problem sets a week is brutal. It helps you to keep on top of your material, but on the other hand it consumes a lot of your time.","John Hall designed a fabulous course! I genuinely enjoyed attending sections and doing the psets. This was by far my favorite class of the semester. Some parts were certainly challenging, but they were challenging in the right way - they mentally stimulated me, and once I arrived at the correct answer, I wanted to explore more. Definitely take this class if you need to fulfill a math requirement. The psets won't be onerous; you'll be glad that you're doing 3 psets a week because they really set solid foundations for advanced work in math.","Math 21b is a very difficult course. I took applied math 21a and did not enjoy it. I thought it was a really difficult class, not interesting material, and I could not stand learning math in a huge lecture. So I decided to take regular math 21b. I do not regret this decision: having three psets a week forces you to stay on top of the material and a small section setting where you can ask questions and participate is really great for learning. Also, Jessica was an amazing TF. That being said, this class was the biggest source of stress of my Harvard career. I found that my entire semester was consumed by psets, and the exams were highly stressful as well. I walked out of the midterms feeling sad and incapable, despite hours upon hours of studying. What was really hard for me was that I actually really enjoyed the material and found it super interesting. But the structure and design of the class made me dislike the experience. Taking this class made me realize that math was not for me, but I would never have known that had I not taken it, so if you're unsure about whether or not to take this class, I would say take it, challenge yourself.","If you're actually interested in learning the material, take regular instead of applied. Three psets a week isn't as annoying as it sounds, and it really does help make learning the material less stressful. Some people complain of the possibility of getting stuck with a bad section leader; taking 21b in the fall may help reduce this possibility. The class itself is pretty fun; if you have prior experience with linear algebra and differential equations then the class will be much easier but you will still be able to learn a lot.","It's a lot more theory based than you would think and it's rather difficult. You have to stay on top of things 24\/7 or you will get lost, and quickly.","Math 21b is just about one of the most useful classes that Harvard and the Math Department offers. It is not a challenging class yet you learn so much in it!! It is your first taste of pure mathematics with all the definitions yet you can see the applications so clearly. And you learn two things (Linear Algebra and Differential Equations) that you can begin using immediately in whichever field you are interested in: Economics, Statistics, Engineering, Computer Science, Linguistics, Finance, Biology, Chemistry, and so on!!!!! I LOVED THIS CLASS! TAKE IT!!","This is a tough course.  But it is really cool material and it is presented in a very organized way.  It is very fulfilling.  Definitely be prepared to work hard.  3 psets a week is not easy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"9.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"97","response rate":"86.60","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 21b","course_id":"2838","cat_num":"1771","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"18","4s":"39","5s":"26"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 21b","course_id":"2838","cat_num":"1771","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"65","4s":"86","5s":"39"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 21b","course_id":"2838","cat_num":"1771","1s":"0","2s":"20","3s":"37","4s":"15","5s":"7"}},"success":true}
