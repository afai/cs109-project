It is also a good introduction to graphics.","This course is interesting, well taught, and the assignments are fun!  What more could you want?","If you are looking for an enjoyable yet constructive Computer Science class, this is the class you need.","It is an extremely enjoyable course with very fun work.  However, expect yourself to be a bit confused and do some outside research to fully understand some of the topics you'll be covered and to become fully comfortable with them.","Watch out for rorocheese.","Be aware that the amount of time for each assignment is not balanced at all; you can spend one hour on one assignment, and fifteen on the next. Be prepared to ask a ton of questions to make things clearer.","Fun class with every interesting material. One of the assignments is to draw fur on a bunny. That's awesome.","This class was great.  I really liked that the focus was almost entirely on getting our programs to work and seeing results.  Having a final project instead of an exam was awesome.","This class provides a good overview for the considerations necessary in Computer Graphics. It is a good class for those interested in graphics for both artistic and scientific purposes.","This is one of the best classes I've taken so far.","In retrospect the concepts aren't incredibly difficult, however when you're trying to hack through them in the context of the labs, they take a lot of time to figure out. You will spend much more time working on this class than you expect."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Being an electrical engineering concentrator, this was a great course to take for credit. I think it is entirely manageable for someone who has only done CS50. I found the material to be very interesting.","Lots of fun to take, you get to create cool-looking stuff.","This course gives you a nice and exciting first step into the world of computer-generated graphics, but be prepared to spend a significant amount of time reading\/understanding code to figure stuff out on your own.","Lectures hard to follow but the assignments are fun","The class is very great. The professor is a relatively boring lecturer, but he genuinely cares about the material and wants you to learn it.","Most people are of the opinion that graphics is really cool and useful.

The lectures are good - slightly mathy at times, so you may have to go back and read the slides on your own to understand the concepts. Working on the p-sets can be very, very frustrating. If you start late, expect to spend a couple of solid days working on them until the deadline (that's where late days come in handy, but if you use them, your weekend will be shot). Sometimes, you will get stuck on one problem for five hours, until you're ready to toss your keyboard out the window. But imagine how awesome it feels when everything finally works! These are the kinds of p-sets you can show to your roommates and have them regret their orgo and quantum classes.","take for a VERY general introduction to the subject.","CS175 will teach you some really cool concepts in graphics, and will leave you with a basic understanding of how to do graphics programming. That being said, I feel I could have gotten much more out of the course. A lot of the problem sets have heavy handholding, making it easy not to learn the concepts.","175 with Hanspeter is probably one of the easiest CS classes in the dept, but beware that 175 with Gortler is probably very different.","Don't take it with Hanspeter. Take 171 for your middle digit. If you want to learn graphics, wait for Gortler to return.","This is an excellent course for learning the fundamentals of computer graphics, and teaches the theories behind it by having the students program in OpenGL and eventually build their own raytracer. The lectures are a bit heavy on math, but very useful, and the guest lectures were all fantastic.","Prof Pfister taught the course this year. His style is very different from who typically teaches this course, so take this year's q guide with a grain of salt.","Be ambitious with your final project and enjoy it!","If you're a concentrator, why wouldn't you want to take this class?","Take this class if you are looking for a lighter CS class that's on an interesting subject.","If you're interested in graphics as a field, and want an easy overview, take this course. Don't expect a whole lot of math or detail.","Use the forums.","You're better off going through one of the many OpenGL (or better yet, DirectX) tutorials on the internet and learning that way.  You can just crash the few interesting lectures, and the feedback on assignments doesn't make them worth doing as part of the course instead of on your own time.","Outstanding course, will teach you how to make awesome projects in graphics. Surveys a lot of modern research areas in graphics, CGI and film industry, photography, video game industry, through guest lectures and the expert teaching staff. The teaching staff are very helpful and the assignments are very clear and well written. This course can definitely get you a good job in the graphics industry. Professor Pfister is a wonderful teacher and makes the lectures a lot of fun. Final projects for the class can turn out very impressive.","This course is a broad introduction to the field of computer graphics that combines both teaching the basics and getting you started as well as demonstrating some interesting real-world examples of graphics.","It's an opportunity to learn something new and come up with a fun project. I imagine the course will improve as they figure out more reasonable assignments and tweak the schedule.","Check the graphics hardware requirements - it's a real pain to have to work on lab computers!","Great class, painless, very interesting if you like computer graphics.","Very cool. If you're into applying simple physics (optics) and linear algebra (vector transformations), you'll love this class.","If you're interested in graphics or how video games are made, this is a great class to take!","Attend lecture, get the most out of Hanspeter, have fun with the final project and use Google!"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The class is great in that you get a solid foundation in graphics. The psets are a lot of work, however, and most of it is left for students to figure out in their own time.","A lot more work than I expected, but rewarding nonetheless.","The course isn't painful. However, you walk away feeling like there's a lot you still don't know how to do. I had difficulty with the final project, and would still have difficulty on a graphics project, since we never actually learned much about how to use OpenGL.","Take this course if you want a good introduction to 3D graphics.  The course primarily uses the OpenGL pipeline (aside from a small section on ray-tracing), but since the emphasis is on the bigger picture \/ theory of graphics you come out of the class with something that would be useful with DirectX as well.  Some of the programming assignments are fairly easy while others are very time-demanding, so be prepared for this.  Gorter and the TFs are great.","The lectures were not super helpful with the problem sets at time, but usually interesting.  Don't put the psets off until the last minute, some of them take quite a bit of time.  Do not take this class unless you are truly interested in the topic, else it will become a major struggle.","great class - you will have to put in work, but it's very rewarding","The professor went through both the fundamental mathematical theories and the practical programming codes in detail. It's a great opportunity to see how the ideas are supported by mathematical theories, and how the mathematical theories are realized as programming codes. This realization provides great experience to human beings. I highly recommended this class.","If you're really into graphics you should take this course. Keep in mind though that lectures are boring and for the most part unnecessary. I feel like the same knowledge could be gleaned from online tutorials with much less headache.","You will learn a ton but you will work for it for sure. Not at all easy but the reward makes it worth it.","Well-designed assignments, but bewarned that you have to spend some time really understanding the code. Don't underestimate the advantage of knowing some C++! Having some extra knowledge and experience will let you focus on the concepts of the course much more easily.","Read the book! There are useful things in it.","Be confident with C++!","Taught in C++, which is pretty easy to pick up if you know C. Make sure you take the time to get to know it though! Sort of mathy, but nothing too complicated. Problem sets aren't especially lengthy, but not trivial by any means."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Graphics is a cool applied course. It's one of the few courses that I've taken in CS at Harvard where the applications are immediate and the end products are extremely satisfying to create. For the final project, find a topic that you're personally interested in and find cool, and then make it.","I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in 3D graphics. It provides a great introduction into a very applicable skill. This class is a must for anyone looking to pursue video game development, special effects in movies, or graphics of some sort.","Pretty good class overall and a good introduction to graphics. Very linear algebra intensive though.","Be prepared for the weekly assignments, and set aside time to do them.  Go to every lecture and make sure to understand the notes.  The assignments can be quite tedious.","Great class! I would recommend especially if you are a CS person interested in game design and\/or movies production. It's really time consuming, but totally worth it.","This class is a solid introduction to concepts in computer graphics. The problem sets can be challenging but are mangeable. You need to have strong programming skills and a reasonable grasp of the major concepts of linear algebra, but beyond that, everything is spelled out for you in lecture\/the handouts. The textbook is excellent but isn't an absolutely mandatory buy as all of the information is also in the handouts (though the textbook fleshes it out a little bit more).","For sure take this class if you have interest in computer graphics at all. Will you learn a lot about OpenGL syntax and the plethora of commands? Not at all.\r\n\r\nBut you will learn a lot about the different theories\/concepts behind CG, as well as a lot of how OpenGL is working behind the scenes. And you'll definitely have some of the cooler psets to show people. Also, it's pretty easy, honestly. Both grade-wise, time-wise, and hardness-wise. The hardest part is usually if the pset description is a little vague. And the written assignments can be tricky.\r\n\r\nBut it's a pain-free, if sometimes boring, course that will teach you a decent amount about CG.","Computer graphics has a very steep learning curve, but this course is a solid foundation. It's easy to get confused at first, and it's not until later in the course that every piece starts to fit together. I enjoy the course, but walk away feeling there are a lot about graphics that I still don't know.","More of a math class than a CS class; make sure you are very interested in graphics","Very manageable class with cool material. I thought the math would be too much for me, but I got along fine. My only complaint is that it's very possible to go through all of the problem sets without actually learning anything, since in most cases everything you need to do is explicitly spelled out in the spec."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Lectures can get pretty dry, but the homework is interesting, reasonable, and it feels good to end up with something cool looking rather than trying to impress your roommates with text output on a command line window. A little linear algebra and C or C++ would help. It's possible but probably harder without either.","Like many more practical fields of CS, computer graphics is made up of lots of little bits and pieces of other theories and subjects, which are strung together to accomplish the end goal (creating pretty pictures with computers). Because of that, it's sort of impossible to teach it as one cohesive and well-connected subject. This course tours you through many of the nuts and bolts that make up modern computer graphics in a very practical way, sequentially working your way through different sub-areas of the field. You won't come away with a comprehensive understanding of the field, but you'll at least have a lot of things demystified, and you'll have a lot to go on if you decide to work with graphics more after the course. The course itself is pretty relaxed, and it's one of the few CS courses at Harvard I've taken that balances laid back administration (no exams, friendly professor and TFs, no terrible grading curves) with assignments that are challenging, substantial, and educational (also the only Harvard CS course I know of that uses C++, a very good language to know). If you're curious about graphics and want to learn, I'd recommend this course.","This is a great class and you'll learn a lot about how graphics works. The workload is not very heavy, but you do need to be somewhat competent in linear algebra.","You probably won't learn that much.","Be prepared to be thrown right into the coding","Class can being boring at times because it's pretty math heavy, but a good intro to graphics","Overall this is a pretty good class. I went in not super excited about graphics, and I came out with a new appreciation for the field and some pretty sweet knowledge and skills. Professor Gortler and Yuanchen are both great. The problem sets can be a little time consuming sometimes (mostly trying to wrap your head around some of the linear algebra stuff; implementation isn't so bad), but overall totally manageable. I'd recommend this course.","At the end of the day, I feel like I just went through the motions of doing pset after pset after pset to be done with the class. I didn't really learn much that I can use to apply in future contexts. To be fair though, I felt like I was able to hack something together for my final project that was pretty cool using code I became familiar with from previous assignments.","A bit of a hodgepodge at times, but you get a good idea of how 3D computer graphics are generated, back to front.  It's a good class, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're not particularly interested in details in graphics.","it is a fun course but pretty time-consuming"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you want to get into the theory of computer graphics, and then have to deal with endless office hours to finish the psets, this is the class for you.

The class itself is relatively straightforward, but I didn't come out of the class enthusiastic about computer graphics. Lectures weren't that effective for me, but sections\/office hours are a MUST for your psets.","If you find graphics interesting, you will like this course. If you don't, you won't.
