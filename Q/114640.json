Just be warned that its A LOT of work.","The course begins at a very low level, with the shapes of the letters and how to write them, and goes all the way up to reading a short story by Pushkin and writing several compositions about it. The course has two components: a grammar class and speaking practice. I felt that both components were beneficial to me, and I learned a lot from both. The professors are very enthusiastic and approachable, and even did all they could to accommodate my hectic schedule. One drawback is that all of the materials come in paper format, which makes them easy to shuffle around if you're a little disorganized like me. Your Russian will likely see drastic improvement, but the course will take up a lot of your time.","You're signing up for a big commitment. A lot of us thought this course would be an easy-A, but no such luck. After the first few times of realizing that your homework is 6 or 7 hours a night, you start to regret taking it.","This is a hard course but by no means unmanageable. The teachers provide great support. If you are a heritage speaker and want to improve grammar and speech, you should go for it."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Extremely useful for Native\/Heritage speakers that wish to greatly improve their Russian ability. Be prepared to work hard in this course!","At first, it was extremely strange and difficult to slow down my speech and begin thinking about grammar rules. It feels really unnatural at first but after time (with a lot of practice and doing your work) this class was effective and made me a much more confident, sophisticated sounding speaker.","This is a wonderful class for heritage Russian speaks who would like to improve their knowledge of the Russian language. After this class I can read and write better and understand more about the language, in terms of sentence structure and grammar.","If you want to improve your Russian, you will learn it.","You will not automatically get an easy A in this class, it requires a fair bit of work-consistent work. That being said, you get out of this class what you put into it. The course staff is extremely dedicated and it has the potential to be a very fulfilling experience-as it was for me. I have enjoyed learning to nuance of a language I have always associated with comfort and home, and can now appreciate its beauty in literature. Consider taking it if you are from a Russian speaking family!","This class is not easy, so you need to be truly dedicated to improving your Russian. I feel that I've learned a lot and am very glad I took it.","It will improve your russian substantially, but be prepared to work hard in it as it is very time consuming. I came in with really only being comfortable in hearing russian and speaking simple things. The professors will do anything to help you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.67","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.33","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SLAVIC Ac","course_id":"4520","cat_num":"0496","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SLAVIC Ac","course_id":"4520","cat_num":"0496","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SLAVIC Ac","course_id":"4520","cat_num":"0496","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
