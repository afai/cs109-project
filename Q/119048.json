'07":{"comments":["Be prepared to think before coming to class.","This class is a very good introduction to semiconductor devices and the physics of semiconductors. It teaches students the basics of semiconductor junctions, which underly much of modern electronics.","This class is not the conventional lecture. It challenges you to think and teaches you how to attack problems intuitively and physically. The professor  is brilliant in doing conveying this by example."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Buy the book, read the lecture notes from the website, send someone to class with a tape recorder, but under no circumstances should you enroll in this course. You will hate every minute of every lecture and every assignment. You will feel belittled for no good reason, and there will be nothing you can do about it.","Fantastic class.  Will learn a lot that can lead to interesting research topics.","I would like to strongly recommend this course to students who are aimed to studying or working in the area of semiconductor devices. This is definitely an excellent course.\r\nHowever, for people who did not learn or haven't touched the quantum mechanics or solid state physics for years, I suggest that they first fill up this gap or review well these subjects before taking this course. But if people are simultaneously taking one of such course (e.g. solid state physics), it might be fine."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is a great course for someone who has never taken a solid state class before. Professor Hu has the ability to effectively communicate the course material to students from a wide range of backgrounds. By the end of this course you will have a good intuitive understanding of how solar cells and transistors work. There is a lot of class participation which is also nice. Would definitely recommend.","The reason why we have telecommunications, lasers, solar energy is because of the concepts we learned in this class. If you want to rule the 21st century, come and learn about the technologies you'll need to use!","Very interesting though low level."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course helps develop a strong understanding of the fundamental physics underlying semiconductor devices.  A few key technologies are discussed, such as p-n junctions, solar cells, and lasers.  However, there is not a lot of discussion about the breadth of devices possible with this technology.","professor hu is the nicest and one of the most impressive professors i've had at harvard. her clarity of thought is tremendous. definitely take this class!","Evelyn Hu is the best teacher for disseminating what is otherwise difficult materials. Everything becomes fun.","Prof Hu is one of the most amazing professors at SEAS. She is a wonderful teacher and really cares for you. She wants you to love the material just as much as she does, and she makes you think about the material in ways that really sparks innovation.","Evelyn is amazing.  You will miss out tremendously if you don't take a course with her before you graduate."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class is incredible. They spend more time on the material YOU want to study, Evelyn is the best engineering lecturer I have ever had, she gives exciting presentations that make you understand the material really well (her analogies are great). The assignments are not too difficult, but adequately test your knowledge of the material. The labs are interesting fun. The take-home midterm and final are given plenty of time in advance and are fun, creative exercise in applying what you've learned. Overall it's a fun course that is low-stress but I probably learned more in this course than my other engineering courses because the lectures were so effective and informative. Best class. (Anyone can take it too...no real pre-recs needed). Please take it. Make your life a bit easier and learn a lot about a really cool subject)","Great Senior Spring engineering course - nicest, best teaching staff. I walked out with more knowledge of semiconductors than I thought I would have - the course isn't very challenging and excuses you from knowing everything about semiconductors. Definitely a good intro to solid state but would want to take more courses \/ read the textbook more before I felt truly confident.","This class is very different than most Engineering\/Science\/Math classes. Professor Hu does an amazing job building intuition rather than simply testing on memorized concepts which are immediately forgotten as soon as the semester ends. The result is that the course load is light and you also end up learning more. As a Chemistry & Physics concentrator, this was a great choice to meet my Physics requirement.","I took this class because I wanted to understand how semiconductors work, especially in relation to solar technology. It was the best decision ever. Professor Hu is absolutely incredible, and focuses on making you understand important concepts, rather than on arduous computation. Also, I had never taken an electrical engineering class, but this class, and Professor Hu have made me regret not taking more electrical engineering courses. As a graduating senior (yes--I took this as an elective my senior spring) I am so happy to have taken this class --definitely one of my top 3 classes at Harvard.","Professor Hu is the best engineering professor at Harvard, hands down. She truly has a gift for teaching, and you simply cannot sit in a class taught by her without learning the material. This class is very well-balanced, and unlike other classes, doesn't require 20 hours psets to try and learn the material since the teaching is superb. Take a class with Professor Hu. You won't regret it.","This class is a GREAT engineering elective to take.  Awesome teaching staff, not at all overwhelming like so many other courses in the department, and you learn how a handful of ubiquitous devices work!","This course is the best!  You should take it even if you're not an engineer!","It's awesome and you learn a lot without having to do a lot of work.","The exams are both take home exams. They are not easy as they require you to make decisions on your own. They are both proposals meaning that there is no right and wrong. You are given a lot of freedom could eventually hurt you if you don't reach out to the staff to get additional guidance. \r\nOverall: TAKE this class. It's a must for basic knowledge in EE.","This is a really good course","Even if you are not an electrical engineer, you should take this class. Everything is explained very well from the basics. The teaching staff is amazing.","good but not the most mathematically rigorous","The teaching staff are incredible -- helpful and friendly.  They really care about the material.  The workload is light, which is both good and bad -- sometimes it was hard to understand material lecture-to-lecture without regular assignments.  I would probably recommend, and I have no EE background.","great class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course provided a good introduction to semiconductor devices like photodetectors and solar cells. Sometimes the homework assignments and design projects were frustrating because we didn't receive much guidance.","Take this class! Very interesting material, really well-taught, and has reasonable exams, psets and labs!","Very good class. It focuses a lot on the conceptual rather than lots of monotonous calculations. Take it if you want to understand more about the fundamentals of how semiconductor devices work. Make sure to talk to Chris and Evelyn to ask clarifying details as you work through the midterm and final projects.","A good platform to learn about semiconductor, photonics","this class is great! great professors, great material. don't take it if you don't like more open-ended engineering design assignments or quantum physics stuff.","ES173 was a great introduction to semiconductor materials and semiconductor devices.  It starts with the molecular-scale building blocks and zooms out to design projects, and because there are no midterm exams you're able to really focus on what you're most interested in.  The design projects are difficult if you have never taken an engineering design class before (I hadn't), but the professors are there to talk to you about it.  Evelyn is fantastic.  Chris was very helpful in office hours.  The only negative for me was that I took it mostly to learn about solar cells, and we didn't get to that material until the last two or three weeks.","This course is an appropriate mixture of theory and application, such that the applications are understood to a deep theoretical level, and the theory is given relevance to its applications.","Very easy course. First half of the course covers very similar material as the first third of ES154.","This class is awesome !! I took this class as a fourth engineering course senior spring and it wasn't a burden at all. This class is completely manageable and a perfect senior spring class: interesting material, super nice professors, laid back, and you get to learn a lot of cool stuff about the mechanisms that underlie many of the solid state devices we use every day. Highly recommend this course !","Great introductory course to solid-state semiconductors. The course builds the material up step-by-step to make it easy to follow and understand. The midterm and final project are also awesome - they are short papers that engage your understanding of the material but take up minimal time and effort to complete unlike a more formal research project.","This is a super interesting class especially if you are interested in something like solar panels - it is really cool to see how everything works on a very microscopic scale.","It was a really good class! Most of the work is conceptual so the assignments are not very hard and yet gives you a really strong in-depth understanding of how semiconductors and semiconductor devices work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"24","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 173","course_id":"1345","cat_num":"3490","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 173","course_id":"1345","cat_num":"3490","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 173","course_id":"1345","cat_num":"3490","1s":"4","2s":"6","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
