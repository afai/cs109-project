I had fun!","This was an absolutely wonderful course on an extremely important topic. Courses on the bootstrap are often too applied - it becomes a cookbook without teaching you how to invent your own recipes - or it is too theoretical - it becomes an exercise in asymptotics. Luke struck a near perfect balance between the two extremes, developing our intuition as well as giving necessary technical details. He was engaging. His humor acted as an emulsifier to help us digest the material, and he was never afraid to pursue tangents which almost always gave us greater understanding of the material (though perhaps not the original material we set out to understand :). The homeworks were initially a bit long (understandable for a first class), but Luke fixed this by the end so next time around everything should be well tuned. A great course with a great instructor - don't miss it when it's given again.","Very, very cool methods not taught elsewhere in the department!  Enjoy!","This class is an interesting look at bootstrapping, a very, very cool and strange topic."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.33","difficulty":"3.67","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 242","course_id":"4854","cat_num":"27674","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 242","course_id":"4854","cat_num":"27674","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 242","course_id":"4854","cat_num":"27674","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
