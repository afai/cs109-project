I felt really bad about missing even one class! However, the class dynamic is a bit iffy. There are some awkward moments when he asks people to cast their scripts and they call on the same friends to read the lines, while others in the class feel left out. The feedback process is a bit difficult too because the class community was not as strong as in other small classes that I have taken.

Also, don't worry about a script being too simple or narrow.  You only have 8 pages to tell a story, and some of my favorites of the one we read told a simple story with clarity and efficiency rather than trying to cram a 2-hour movie into eight pages.","A great introduction to screenwriting.

It was a lot of fun and not an overwhelming amount of work, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in creative writing or storytelling."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you want to learn about screenwriting, this is really your only option at Harvard, so you should take it!","Harvard doesn't offer too many opportunities for student screenwriters, so anyone interested in the entertainment industry should jump on this ASAP.","Great place to actually produce a body of writing.","It's a great class that will make you laugh and you will learn a lot. Be prepared for unexpected challenges, since this is a very different style of writing from anything you may have done before. Be patient with yourself and know that if you listen to Danny and put the effort into it, you can really get the hang of screenwriting and it can be very enjoyable.","THIS CLASS IS AMAZING! IF YOU CAN GET INTO IT, TAKE IT, REGARDLESS OF SCREENWRITING BACKGROUND!","This is a fun and engaging course with a laid-back atmosphere and the work is more recreational than monotonous."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["A well-designed\/paced course that forces you to write on a regular basis and creates a tight-knit community through peer feedback.  I could spend several paragraphs praising Danny Rubin's teaching, but 2012-13 is probably his last year :(\r\nResearch the new teacher and see what his background is.  Danny's experience in the industry was extremely helpful.","Do everything you can to take this class - if you are a movie lover, it is the perfect class for you.","If you're looking for a creative outlet, this class is perfect. An 8 page script every week is not a lot, and it's the perfect length to tell a short story and hone your skills at screenwriting. The open feedback system is also very helpful, and will help you be a better writer by the end.","This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Danny is incredible. Take it!","One of the best courses I've taken at the college.","A wonderful class if you've always wanted to write a screenplay but you don't know how. It won't change the stories you write, but it will make you write them more elegantly (burying your exposition) and more visually, and it will teach you what a screenplay looks like by making you write an 8 page screenplay every week.","A workshop-driven class under the supervision of Danny Rubin, who consistently challenges you in his feedback of your work. A great place to \"learn by doing\". As a writer, it is essentially a playground to experiment with your style, preferences, genre, etc. I think it is perfect for beginning aspiring screenwriters.","Danny Rubin is the absolute best.","Rubin will be gone after next semester. Take Screenwriting 2 while you can! You'll never watch movies he same way again.","If you love movies, and want to understand the underlying structure and design by which they are made - the blueprint, as it were - this course is essential. It's the chance to learn this with one of the absolute masters of the craft in America.","Great class, take it!","Prof. Rubin was funny, engaging, accessible and knowledgable--he is undoubtedly an expert in the field of screenwriting and the movie industry. The in-depth interactive workshops on different aspects of film were fantastic because they got our brains flowing with ideas, and drew us in to specific skills used in narrative creation. The lectures were organized and often included instrution\/skills sessions, script workshopping, and video clip examples. The class fostered community through scriptwriting and I feel like I'm leaving the class with friends and a tangible skill.","I am so glad I was able to take this course! It is such a fun and yet still very intellectually stimulating course. I walked into course knowing absolutely nothing about screenwriting and left with some new skills that I am excited to continue improving and applying to other academic disciplines as well. The course is taught incredibly well and the sense of community between the classmates and with the professor is something you wont find anywhere else at school. Definitely take it!","Great, great atmosphere! The course really develops your skills as a writer and your comfortability with the medium. Definitely recommend it for those interested in screen writing!","Awesome class. Definitely take it.","Take this class! You learn so much about Hollywood, making movies, and how to navigate a completely new form of creative writing that few people have ever explored. I absolutely loved it - the 3 hours flew by every week.","You only get as much out of this class as you put into the assignments.","I learned a lot about screenwriting and the class was very engaging. I found it challenging to have to come up with a new story idea each week, but the work of writing screenplays was ultimately really rewarding. Overall, a fun and interesting course.","This class is amazing. Take if you have any interest in creative writing\/film.","You will have so much fun learning a creative skill that is so applicable to the movies you watch and love. You will never look at a film the same way, but you will appreciate the art so much more."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you have the opportunity to take this course, take it. Danny is leaving but I'm sure they'll find someone good to replace him. This has been my favorite course here.","This course is not difficult, it is fun. The work is not hard but it does exist and you will get as much out of it as you put in.","This is a great course, but more than any other course I've taken you only get from it what you're willing to put in. If you are willing to work hard at it and really consider your peers' screenplays, than you'll derive quite a bit from the experience. Danny was a very good professor, and it was a friendly and fun environment. You won't produce anything you can actually submit to people, but you will get a good sense of story structure and the tropes of screenwriting.","It might come down to who is teaching the course, but screenwriting is a fantastic creative mode to explore here.","Start your scripts early so you have a chance to take a break, then go back and edit. Go to office hours to get the inside scoop on Hollywood and how it actually works."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The dude, Mark Poirier. he's a cool guy. it was a good environment. friendly. fun stuff.","This class is maybe one of the best classes I've ever taken. It made me incredibly aware of how movies are structured\/written when I watch them, which in turn made me able to think about my own work more productively. It also makes you centralize the importance of characters in your work and making your films character-driven.","If you're interested in film, writing, new media, or just appreciate a good story, this class is for you.","This is a fabulous class and you'll learn a lot about what makes a screenplay successful.","This class is a must take!","If you are interested in becoming a better writer or storyteller, then you should absolutely take this course. You get what you put into it- if you want to learn, then Professor Poirier is more than willing to engage you in meaningful conversations on how to make your work better.","This was a great course for getting me started on my feature and Mark is a plethora of stories.","Mark is an entertaining teacher, but more so than most Harvard teachers, has a very specific aesthetic that colors his content and feedback more so than usual. Very into depressed\/depressing characters.","It's difficult to pinpoint what you might learn in this class. That's not to say that you don't learn anything, but it felt at once without direction and mono-perspectival. There's not enough actual writing or character development for either to be terribly useful, but the writing that you do is helpful as an exercise in forcing yourself to do it.","Mark is the best. Great class to learn from a real screenwriter.","Take it. Mark's a really great teacher, and it's a fun class. It's great to see what other students write, and having structured, lengthy feedback is the best. Mark really pays individual attention to what each person wants to get out of the class, and that's really all I could ask for.","Great course! Mark is hilarious, the work is interesting, and the assignments are not hard but fun! I would recommend this to anyone, even as a 5th class. Changes your perspective about the film industry and will change the way you watch films and write plays\/screenplays."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Screenwriting is the secretly great form of creative writing and Mark will teach you how to do it well in a semester. You'll start thinking about how films and tv emerge from a script, and you'll get pretty far along creating your own screenplay. Mark's a terrific seminar leader and incredibly supportive of his students.","If you're interested in taking screenwriting, it's better than nothing at all, but the direction of the course could definitely be improved. Maybe it will be!","If you're at all interested in screenwriting take this class. It is essential. It's also incredibly enjoyable.","Great class, especially for those who are very new to screenwriting.","Screenwriting 1 was an awesome class and highly recommended for anyone interested in writing films in the future as a hobby or career. This class really gave me a lot of confidence with my writing and will allow me to write on my own in the future!","If you want to be a screenwriter, absolutely (I repeat, absolutely) take this course. However, just full disclosure here, if you want to take a creative writing course for whatever reason, whether you're looking to explore a creative passion or just try something new, I think there might be other courses out there which are more explorational. This course is perfect for anyone who has an idea of what you want to write, because Mark will help you make that thing a reality. But this is very much a screenwriting course, so make sure you like writing\/reading in that medium before undertaking it (which should be obvious, right?)","If you have any interest at all in screenwriting, I would recommend you take this course. Mark is great and his class gives you the opportunity to try out screenwriting and see if you'd enjoy it."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Take this class! Mark is awesome, and the workshop format allows for really solid feedback on your work.","This class is a lot of fun. Mark is a great guy and you really do come away with a better understanding of the demands of screenwriting.","There is no reason not to apply to this course! Whether you want to make it in the industry or you're just curious to learn about the elusive craft of screenwriting, everyone learns so much from analyzing each other's creative concoctions. Be sure to be able to ask questions and take criticism positively, as honest feedback is the only way that your writing can improve. The creative process can be frustrating, and some people start at different levels than others, but if you go to office hours, and seek other people's opinions, than there is no reason that you will improve your eye for good writing and good film via this course! Be sure to write a story your passionate about, even if it is super ambitious and crazy, because you want all the waning hours spent thinking about your protagonist to be worth it and voluntary!","Screenwriting with Mark Poirier is a fantastic course. As with all workshop courses, you determine the dynamic of your course. We had a great arrangement of unique voices. Mark facilitated discussion very well, and his comments were extremely helpful. Mark's knowledge of the industry and his care for his students really shines through as he leads class. If you get into this course: Absolutely go to office hours. Mark is extremely helpful one-on-one, especially as you develop your ideas. He also advises us based on all of his industry experience.","Take this course if you want anything to do with screenwriting or TV writing.","This course is fabulous and Mark is a great instructor!  I learned so much from the feedback and practice writing this course provided me, and I feel like I'm in a good place to continue my screenplay into its second and third acts and finish it on my own.  It gives you the tools you need to write screenplays of any genre in the future.","GREAT!","Take it. Even if you don't plan to be a screenwriter or if you're not interested in film. This class will make you a better writer and overall better thinker."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"5.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH Clr","course_id":"1472","cat_num":"6121","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH Clr","course_id":"1472","cat_num":"6121","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH Clr","course_id":"1472","cat_num":"6121","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
