Both professors are really knowledgeable and the class gets really in depth. This is a very challenging class though. The concepts are difficult and there is a lot to learn, so some background psych or linguistics knowledge is very helpful. I'm a psych concentrator and I found the psych parts challenging sometimes. I also took Linguistics 101 simultaneously and found that incredibly useful.","This was a good class that combines linguistics and psychology. I especially enjoyed this course because I am interested in language development and am planning to do a secondary in linguistics. That being said, the linguistics part will feel a little rushed, especially if you don't have any prior background in linguistics. But grading was quite generous and section was great, so you shouldn't have to worry too much.\r\n\r\nProf. Snedeker speaks really fast and Prof. Chierchia speaks really slow, so it would be a good idea to shop the class and see if are okay with it. But they are fantastic professors who are big in the field.","If you are REALLY interested in the subject matter, I recommend this course. Otherwise, the logistics and organization of the course may (negatively) outweigh anything you might potentially gain from taking it.","This course is really really cool. I would certainly recommend it, and I would also recommend not to be put down by the first few lectures\/meetings! It is kind of confusing in the beginning, and moves a little quickly, but once you get into the course, you will see just how rich and complex and amazing the topic and field really is. Moreover, getting to learn from these two professors is truly a privilege. They are both so incredibly smart, and just wonderful people to talk with! There are two components: the psychology component and the linguistic component that interrelate. It definitely has opened my eyes to the wonders of language, and I really enjoyed the class.","This class is a gem.  The material is fascinating, Jesse and Gennaro are both excellent teachers with very different styles.  The contrast between them will keep you engaged."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1605","course_id":"11096","cat_num":"48568","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1605","course_id":"11096","cat_num":"48568","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1605","course_id":"11096","cat_num":"48568","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
