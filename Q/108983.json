'08":{"comments":["If it's given, make sure Jason Stanyek's teaching it.

I learned so much and was honored to be able to participate in discussion with full-fledged professors!","Unfortunately, this class is not replicable - if something like this is offered again - TAKE IT!","this was a rare and incredibly valuable experience to spend an entire semester with several of the most brilliant scholars working in american musicology today. not to be missed!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is amazing! Try to take as many courses with these two professors as you can during your time here. In teaching this course together, Shelemay and van Orden opened up an incredibly intriguing historical-contemporary musicological dialogue that has forever altered my perspective on musical topics. I learned so much from the participating graduate students, too, and also through careful engagement with a wide variety of case study examples.","Great atmosphere and fascinating topic","Great opportunity to become familiar with the major literature on music and migration, and to pursue a project of interest to you."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A brilliant class with a brilliant professor on how music+text+drama interact. But a very flawed seminar. Prof Albright left far too much time of the course up to presentations from the students. Perhaps the format will change next time it's offered... Also, the level of the musical conversation was very low. But it is wonderful to engage with Prof Albright's ideas.","I know Shakespeare can seem intimidating at times, but to those I would recommend this course all the more.  No matter the level at which you enter, you will leave with a much deeper understanding for and appreciation of Shakespeare and Verdi (among others).  Do not worry if you specialize in either Shakespeare or music, but not both: one will more than suffice.","This class covers broad thematic strokes, and is dependent on the expertise of the students who enrol. There is the opportunity to have fascinating discussions about Berlioz, Verdi, Britten, and Shakespeare, but the preparation requires effort!  Study the music carefully with the score, and bring lots of ideas to seminar, where everyone will benefit form them\nAlbright takes a historical approach, lectures are packed with information.","one of the best cross-concentration classes you will take at Harvard. if only there were more...","great way to learn shakespeare through music","Dr. Albright is kind, brilliant, quirky, and hilarious! This course provides a fun\/ unique way to analyze Shakespeare. Take this course!","This is possibly the most enjoyable course I've taken.  Professor Albright is a unique genius and an inspiration.  If you have any interest in Shakespeare or Verdi, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!","sometimes lecture parts of the class are a bit dull, but albright is brilliant and has a lot to share, and is also very nice.","This is one of those must-take courses at Harvard. If you are interested in Shakespeare, this is the best Shakespeare course you can possibly take. If you are interested in opera, this is a great way to study opera and learn a lot about Shakespeare and the adaptations of his plays into operas. It is a fun course, and by simply reading the plays (about 1 every 2 weeks), you will have a lot to contribute in lecture (which is small) and section."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"12","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 194r","course_id":"3663","cat_num":"98795","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 194r","course_id":"3663","cat_num":"98795","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 194r","course_id":"3663","cat_num":"98795","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
