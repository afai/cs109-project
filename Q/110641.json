I just wish my instructor had allowed us to speak more in class.","This course gives you a great introduction to a beautiful language and the culture of Brazil--you get a really solid basis for further studies in the language.","If you've already studied Spanish you should go ahead and acquire Portuguese!","It is a very enjoyable and manageable class. They make it as painless as possible.","A fun and informative, although non-intensive, introduction to Portuguese.","It's very easy, and a nice senior year elective. It was also a good feeling to add an extra language into my repertoire so easily, and the teaching staff does a good job of teaching Spanish speakers how to speak Portuguese.","That it has a great professor who is very understanding and approachable and cares about each individual student. He always is interested in what you have to say and is enthusiastic about sharing knowledge of Brazilian culture with his students.","Portuguese Ac and Ad are probably the easiest courses taught at Harvard. That said, the course covers a lot of information, including all the grammar patterns you'd need to express yourself fluently in a Portuguese-speaking country, and all of the TAs are absolutely wonderful and willing to help with anything."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This is an excellent class to take if you have a background in Romance Languages. The learning curve for Portuguese is not horrible if you already know another Romance Language. It's a great way to pick up a 3rd language!","This is an enjoyable, painless course and can even easily be taken as a fifth class.","One of the most fun classes at Harvard, and you learn an incredible amount.  Highly recommended.","GREAT GREAT CLASS! Super fun and you learn SO fast.","Portuguese is a hidden gem in the Romance Languages Department. Take it, and you will not be disappointed.","everyone must take it","The Portuguese Department is one of the most accessible ones in the university.  They are not only friendly and easy going, but also helpful and knowledgeable.","You will learn Portuguese, and you will enjoy it.","Work hard and have a good time. You will learn a lot.","Take this class.","Portuguese is so beautiful and so much fun to learn!  All of the people working in this department are amazing so don't be afraid to reach out to any of them.","Doing the practice questions on the website really helps prepare  you for the exams!","Portuguese for Spanish Speakers is a wonderful class, representative of Harvard's incredibly strong language program. As someone who had only a little bit of exposure to the language previous to my two semesters in the program, I would now say that I would be comfortable interacting with native speakers in and outside of Brazil. I particularly enjoyed our oral presentation assignment this semester where we summarized and discussed articles pertaining to issues occurring in the Portuguese-speaking world. The level of discussion that emerged from this assignment were the best that I have had in any class this semester. A final note: the assignments are interesting and no strain.","excellent class; great, fun way to learn a language","Excellent follow-up to Beginning Portuguese for Spanish speakers. The course is an ideal space to develop speaking, listening, reading and writing abilities.","If you want to learn Portuguese, take this class.","provides strong foundations for portuguese language ability","truly excellent in every respect","Great course where one really learns and manages to converse, write and read Portuguese within the year.  Excellent skill building class."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["You should enjoy learning languages.","This is a great class! Everyone in the Portguese department is warm and welcoming and generate such enthusiam for the language!","Like Portuguese Ad, this course is an easy and fun way to learn some Portuguese. And as with the first semester course, the opportunity to learn a lot is there if you take it. The opportunity to learn close to nothing is also there, though, and it can be tough to stay motivated. Definitely take advantage of the language resource center for speaking practice and general help.","Make sure you are willing to practice your Portuguese all the time if you want to do well!","POrtuguese is seriously the funnest class I have taken here. ALthough you're learning a language, the atmosphere of the class just makes it seem so much more relaxed by coupling learning material with material from Brazilian popular culture, from news articles, etc. I would definitely recommend this course.","This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard and if you want to learn a useful language while still having fun, Portuguese is for you.","Great and easy way of becoming fluent in a language.","Amazing class!! Please do not miss out on this gem.","This class is a great way learn Portuguese for those who are interested in traveling to Brazil, or who just want to learn a new language.  Make sure to get a section with Chris is you can-- he made the class completely painless and very fun.  I looked forward to going to class and can't wait to continue Portuguese."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class is very easy and allows you to learn a significant amount of portuguese. i really suggest taking it although the workbook can get extremely tedious at times and can take up a lot of time if you save it until the last minute (which you probably will do)","This class is AWESOME! Who wouldn't want to learn another language. Especially the language spoken in Brazil!! Especially since the World Cup AND the olympics will be there in the next few years. Cmon!","If you want to have fun learning a language, and learn a new language relatively quickly, this is a great way to do it. If you're interested, chances are you will love this class!","It's a great way to learn a new language.","This is definitely an awesome course. It is not that difficult and I am so","If you put in the work, and do the workbook exercises conscientiously and attentively, you will be very well versed with regards to portuguese speaking and reading.","This class is a very fun experience. I have a lot of friends in other language courses who make it sound like learning a new language is painful. I was able to learn a new language and have fun along the way without stressing out about a grade.","This class is the exact same as Beginning Portuguese so you should really only take it if you're interested in learning the language or just taking an easy course.  The name of the course--Portuguese for Spanish Speakers--means nothing.  If you know Spanish, you will probably be able to learn the material more quickly because the languages are so similar, but don't let the title of the course fool you into thinking that the course material and the way in which it is taught will be catered to you.","This course is very laid-back, but you will learn a substantial amount of Portuguese if you keep up!  Its also a great opportunity to meet other students. Conceicao is an excellent TF and made an effort to get to know us outside of class!","I would recommend it without any reservations! It has been one of the best courses of my Harvard career and completely helpful for my career development!","This class is amazing! You will learn so much, and you'll have fun while doing it. The workbook exercises do take time, but doing them will help you to feel much more confident about your abilities with regards to Portuguese.","This class is absolutely wonderful. It's such a refreshing breather from other classes, especially if you are premed. You learn so much in this course. By the end of the semester, you will be able to carry a full conversation with a native speaker. The instructors for this course and the Portuguese department as a whole are incredible. They are very conscientious and truly care for the welfare and learning of their students. This has been my favorite class at Harvard by far. Have the audacity to do something a little different but rewarding. Take this class!","This class is excellent. If you want to learn Portuguese fast and well this class is perfect. The section are small and the class is not very difficult. As long as you keep up with the workbook problems the quizzes and tests will be a piece of cake. Please please take it!","This class is amazing and so much fun. It is definitely worth the effort.","It is as advertised, but not stressful","The faculty is amazing.","Amazing class take it!","Take it.","One of the best courses around. A lot is learned, and you have a bunch of fun while you're at it. What more can you ask for?","It's a great opportunity to learn a really interesting language and also to learn a little about Brazilian culture.","I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to quickly begin learning a new language now that you have mastered Spanish. I loved my experience! This is especially true since a lot of Ac people went through to Ad-- great vibe and interesting language.","excellent course","It is best if you are already able to communcate basic ideas in the language. Else, it could be frustrating as there is little speaking practice and all of a sudden you have to try and get a point across.","One of the best language classes at Harvard. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the language or may travel to Brazil or Portugal.","This is a great course and an excellent way to continue to learn grammar and vocabulary.","Portuguese is a wonderful language and this course will definitely help you learn the language and learn about Portuguese-speaking countries.","It's great, not stressful at all, and lots of fun.","Very fun course. Learn a lot and the work load is VERY manageable. Portuguese department is great."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It's a fun class that is going to be very useful in the future!","I highly recommend this course-- one of the best decisions I've made at Harvard. Easy to learn, fun atmosphere, and not too much work beyond the workbook.","If you know Spanish, you might as well learn Portuguese. If you already took Ac, then Ad isn't that much different, except you learn more tenses and conjugations, so you really can get to have a conversation with native speakers. You can easily understand Portuguese fluently","It is a great class. Not stressful at all, and you do learn a lot not only about portuguese but also about portuguese-speaking countries.","If you speak spanish and took the first semester portuguese for spanish speakers, this course is too slow and repetitive","Portuguese is the best language at Harvard. So useful and so beautiful.","This class is a great way to learn a new, increasingly influential language, in a productive and fun environment.","Take this class. Portuguese is incredibly simple to learn if you already know Spanish, but distinct and cool in its own way. Don't be complacent with only knowing one foreign language.","This is such a great course!! TAKE IT!! You find that by the end of the year, you have pretty effortlessly learned an immense amount of Portuguese, and that you're applying it to various scenarios in your life. I took it as a fifth class, and it's definitely manageable, not to mention incredibly fun. So glad I took it!","This is an amazing class. The TFs are extremely helpful and accesible, generating enthusiasm for the subject.","I loved this class! It's so much fun and you're learning, too. Hard combination to find.","This class is great for Spanish speakers that want to quickly learn a new language.","It's quite easy and fine.","Take this class. You could easily take it as a fifth course if you want to. Heloisa is absolutely wonderful and makes class a pleasure. Go for smaller sections if you can. You speak a lot more and generally have a better experience if you develop a good class dynamic.","This class was VERY enjoyable, and it was relatively low-stress while still providing me with a GREAT background of the Portuguese language and culture. Overall it was by far one of my favorite language courses offered at Harvard.","TAKE IT!! Brazil is the next big thing, and with the World Cup and the Olympics coming up, Portuguese will be very useful if you want to go. It's also super easy to learn, and really just a beautiful language.","Painless way to learn a new language","Great course!","It is great to see your fluency skills continuously improve as you transition from grammar exercises and vocabulary studies to discussions, debates, and cultural studies.","I learned a great deal throughout the semester. If you want to learn Portuguese, take it!","youll love it.","Portuguese is great. It's a small class and most of the teachers in the department are really chill and fun.","Great class! Very fun, you learn a lot of Portuguese in a short amount of time, low workload, and quite easy. I would definitely recommend it!","This class is a fun way for Spanish speakers to learn Portuguese. The workload isn't that much and you walk away with a lot by the end of the second semester.","The emphasis is on conversation, communication, and fluency."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["One of the most fun classes I've taken at Harvard.

It is lots of fun and you learn a lot.","it's a great class that goes at a good pace and the department is understanding if you get overwhelmed or need extra help","This is a great class where we learn a lot of Portuguese. However, it should meet more often.","Great, fun, easy class especially if you have enjoyed taking Spanish classes or any other intro language classes.","The section leader makes or breaks how enthusiastic you will be about the course.  But the course work itself is very good at helping you learn the language.  You just have to be willing to engage in class to get the most out of it.","Portuguese Ad is an amazing class! You really learn a lot, and get to be a lot more comfortable speaking in Portuguese (which is honestly one of the hardest things for me). The teachers really care, and even though it's a basic class, you feel like you've learned a lot more!","Great course! Really helped further my understanding and knowledge of the language and culture.","Great class. Chill. You learn a lot.","Luca is the best! He reall works to make sure you feel comfortable with the language!","They did not take as much advantage of our knowledge of Spanish as I had hoped.  We also didn't learn much more than the normal Ab class. I was hoping for more rigor.","This course is a blast and you truly walk away able to communicate in basic portuguese. If you have a remote interest in Brazil it's totally worth it. JUST DO IT!","Awesome class. Useful language to have a grasp of. Assignments are fair.","Though your experience depends a great deal on the teaching fellow, it seems that they range from \"pretty good\" to \"AMAZING!\" and this semester I luckily had an \"AMAZING!\" TF: Luca Prazeres. Get in his section if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u201dclass flew by every day (though we were still learning!) and I am pretty sure this was my favorite language class I've ever taken thanks to him. I am very happy I took portuguese this year\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddo it!","This class is a gem! I have found that I love learning a new language and there is little stress involved in this class. The relaxed environment is a great way to balance out harder classes and an enjoyable way to learn a new language.","I really loved taking this course with Max. I was able to learn a lot of new verb forms in Portuguese and expand my knowledge of vocabulary.

I definitely feel that I could travel to Brazil and be able to get around without a problem after taking this class.","This is a class worth taking, although in order to advance with the language, students must put in additional time and effort on their own in preparing the material.","This course is very interactive and fun. You make a lot of great friends because you get to see your classmates every day, and the professors are all very enthusiastic.","This is a great class, and you learn a ton (especially with Viviane)! It's a bit more rigorous than people may be used to for language courses in the Romance Languages department, but I'd say it's worth it.","If you have Viviane, she will challenge you to learn. I think that every TF has his or hers pros and cons. Some focus of speaking Portuguese, others are grammar police. When taking this course, you should not only consider if the TF is right for you based on the time of the course, but also on what you see necessary for you to learn the language.","This class is challenging, but will provide you with a solid instruction of Portuguese grammar.","This class is incredibly fun! However there are small assignments that add up and end up taking time.","The course is very useful and fun but my positive experience was much due to having Stephen as my TF. I find that for these classes, your experience will be highly dependent on who your TF is, which may not necessarily end up that well for you.","The class was great. It was such a fun way to learn more Portuguese. It wasn't too easy but it wasn't too hard either; it was a very balanced class. The teaching was great too!!!","This is an awesome course, a lot of fun, and a great way to balance a schedule. You meet Monday through Thursday so I noticed that I actually got to know my classmates and form meaningful relationships with them, unlike every other class I've ever taken at Harvard.
