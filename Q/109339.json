Take it if you are passionate about CSE!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You will learn a lot in this course! The workload is very reasonable, and the speakers are all really awesome. It's a great way to open up your horizons in terms of the new material that you can cover.","A great exposure to numerous applications of computational science. Chances to interact with industry leaders.","This is a good course to take in conjunction with a very heavy workload, since it is relevant to the CSE program material but not very time demanding.","It's really cool to see how computational methods are being used in other fields. Highly applicable to the real world.","The seminars can be hit or miss depending on your particular interests, but you will gain a broad exposure to computation in various areas, both in academia and industry. The workload is quite light, so it will help keep your semester sane.","It's a great opportunity to hear about the work of people in different fields. Also you get the chance to meet professors which is also very valuable.","Great course!","This course is easy, but you won't learn much.  If you are taking a tough workload otherwise for the semester, this can be a good addition to your schedule.","great course. you learn a lot, get a lot of different perspectives on the field. It's definitely widened my understanding of what research topics are hot and how immensely wide the scope for research is in computational science. very chill too. it is ideal: learn a lot without much stress"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A great course to balance out an unwieldy or interview-ridden semester, but be warned: not really fulfilling unless you have the applied math background to understand the readings and guest lectures.","This is a discussion-based course providing a high level view of a broad range of topics in computational science. Doing the background reading and attending the pre-seminar discussion are really helpful in getting the most out of the seminar presentation itself. This is a good course to balance out a heavy workload, but hopefully you will find the material engaging as well.","This class is great for students whose schedules are otherwise full of heavily technical coursework. The more \"communicative\" nature of 298r makes for nice schedule balance.","It is a necessary course if your other courses are rigorous and demanding.","Taking this course only as a buffer to prevent you overloading in one semester.","If you need a class to balance out your work load.
