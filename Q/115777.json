I would recommend this class to anyone interesting in writing."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["During the first half of the semester, this course features clear, helpful lectures on the basic aspects of fiction writing; during the second half, it consists of workshops that focus intently on your work. Both halves will improve your writing immensely. Work hard in this course, and you will be rewarded.","It might not be possible to teach writing, but if anyone can do it, it's probably Bret. He is warm, genuine, witty, supportive, and wise. The first part of this course, which focuses on the technical basis of fiction writing, will teach you tidbits that you will start to notice in all of the fiction you read and in your own writing. The opportunity to write a short story and have it rigorously evaluated by your peers -- and the chance to read and critique your 11 impressive classmates' work -- is a rare personal moment that only workshop classes can offer.","If I could, I would take this class for the remainder of my time at Harvard. It is that good.","This was the best class that I've taken so far at Harvard. It was a weekly reminder of why I want to be a writer.","This has been my favorite course at Harvard, and I learned so much about writing. Bret's a great teacher and you really get to know everyone in the course, which is great.","If you take this class, it will be one of the best classes you've taken at Harvard. Bret is an incredible teacher and it will be a higlight of your time here.","You have to apply for this course. My biggest regret is waiting until senior spring to finally apply, but I'm so glad that I was able to at least take it then. You'll read a diverse sampling of short stories that will inspire you to try out new techniques. But most important are the workshops. Critiquing other students' writing truly helps you develop your own. Sure, it's a little intimidating listening to your peers tear apart your story for an hour+, but you'll emerge a much better writer, with better stories.","Bret is great, and you'll learn a lot from him."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This class is excellent.  If you have the opportunity to take this class, you should.  It is simply the best course I have taken at Harvard for learning how to write, read, and think.","The workload can get pretty heavy, but you will absolutely come out of this as a better writer.","This is a wonderful class. Workshop is very fun, and I believe it's hard not to make friends in a small class setting.","If you have ever had any interest in writing stories or novels, take this class! I have always felt that the best writing is that which conveys a unique experience to the reader, and that seemed to underlie many of the topics we discussed in class. The first half of the class is an overview of what works best in a story and defines the appropriate role of characters, plot, structure, etc within a story, putting a technical spin on writing. Having taken the class, I can see how important and helpful having a technical, tangible basis in writing fiction is for creating a successfully satisfying story. The second half of the class is entirely workshop oriented. It is incredible to have the opportunity to write one's own story and bring it to a workshop setting. Bret is absolutely phenomenal and very respectful of everyone's writing. He's probably too awesome. I would take this class every semester if I could--it is inexplicably wonderful to know that I have a skill set necessary to do what I love. Seriously, I am not being dramatic. Just take the class.","If you are at all serious about fiction writing, take this class.  I can tell through my own writing that Bret's feedback and the feedback of my peers have improved my plot construction, character development, etc. enormously.  In other words, this class will simply make you a better fiction writer.","If you want to learn creative writing from an awesome instructor in a casual and supportive environment, then this is the place for you."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you're lucky enough to be accepted into this class, you absolutely must take it. Bret knows how to conduct a respectful and intelligent workshop, and he always knows where a story's heart is (I suspect he has a stethoscope for such things). He's an intelligent reader--you'll enjoy the first half of the course because the short story selections are phenomenal, ranging from Chekhov to O'Connor, Denis Johnson to Michael Cunningham. Having these reading materials throughout the semester is a gift. Appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you've studied fiction pretty in-depth before (either by yourself, or through past workshop experiences), you'll definitely find yourself entertained here. Bret has a great dry sense of humor and he really knows how to convey and articulate ideas. If you get the chance, check out some of his short stories, too--they're wonderful, and they'll give you an appreciation of some of the great talent we have on campus.\r\n\r\nOverall, a phenomenal class. The only pitfall is that you will want to focus on creative writing to the detriment of your other classes. But then again, is that really such a bad thing?","The class offers a resoundingly different look at what makes a story \"good,\" and, I promise you, WILL make you improve your writing.","Take advantage of this class. Read everything and think about what makes a good story. Be engaged during the workshops, and push yourself to write about new things, because the feedback will always be constructive and not judgmental.","OMG TAKE THIS IT'S THE BEST CLASS EVER AT HARVARD EVER. (If you are at all interested in writing, that is.) It helped me so much. Bret is the best!!!","If you want to become a better writer, take this class. This class will open your eyes to things that you never saw before in fiction and you will look at the world in a whole new light.","Definitely take this class if you are able-- a lot of these comments always say that but I realize that not everyone gets in. I'd say if you don't get it just keep trying as many times as possible-- I got rejected twice before getting into this one, but I kept applying every semester and eventually I made it, and it is really worth it. If you want to explore the craft of fiction or really yearn to become an author, this class has your name on it, and you will find all the inspiration, motivation, and confidence you need here.","If you love to write, take this course.","Bret is great and the course is great.  It really builds not only your skill and knowledge of writing fundamentals, but also your confidence as a writer.","Great class! Seriously, you won't regret it!","THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Bret is an absolutely amazing professor, and created the perfect learning environment. He treats each and every member as a true writer, and not as his inferior or just a student. His knowledge of fiction writing is incredible, and the advice he gives about how to write a story is inspiring and amazing. Every short story that we read for homework was a pleasure to read, and every creative writing assignment was a joy to do. This class is a refreshing break from all the time that we as students spend going through the motions just to get a good grade, and every moment of it was amazing.","Do everything possible so that you can take this course! By far the best class I've taken at Harvard. If you don't get in the first time try try again because it will be worth it."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Bret Johnston is hilarious, warm, kind, respectful, insightful and tremendously talented. Harvard is privileged to have him. This class is a wonderful opportunity to benefit from the many talented peers that we are honored to have surrounding us.","Take this class if you can write, that is, if you right now are capable of writing a short story. If you're a little bit terrified of writing, though you have some knowledge base, the class is a little bit terrifying.","Bret takes you seriously - as a writer, not just a student.  He's very approachable and gives feedback that's both kind and useful.  The atmosphere of the course was simultaneously professional, educational, and entertaining, which improved my learning.  The small class size allowed for personal attention and valuable discussion.  Both the instruction and the assignments (readings and some writing exercises) served as groundwork for writing and revising the final story.","This class has made me a better thinker, and a more sincere writer. The ways in which I have been encouraged to think about language and to think about people during it have given me a much greater appreciation for both language and people.","This class had potential to be excellent. This semester Bret seemed distracted with other things. However, that doesn't mean it won't be great in the future.","This course may very well have changed my academic trajectory. Bret is a fantastic professor, and an incredible resource outside of class as well- very down to earth, and absurdly knowledgable about fiction writing (he helped me navigate a roadblock within my piece that had been problematic for weeks, by simply talking though my plot). Do not hesitate for a second to apply for this class. I was intimidated by the whole application process, but I could not have asked for a better semester. I got to read the work of some pretty remarkable peers, and I received intelligent and thoughtful comments on the work that I turned it. I only wish this class lasted for longer than one semester. Take it; I promise you won't regret it.","If you are interested in writing, this class is a must-take! It really helps you to become aware of your strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and I definitely saw an improvement in my writing over the course of the semester. Most importantly, however, it allows you to be in the presence of some very talented student writers who might inspire your own work."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It's probably the best class you will take at Harvard, do it.","The two fiction writing courses I have taken at Harvard have been hands-down the best courses I have taken in my 4 years.  The regular Fiction with Bret starts with technical overview, which even for experienced writers was extremely helpful, and continues with exercises and workshops.  Despite being a lot of work, this course was always fun to work on and never actually felt like \"work.\"  If you can get into it, TAKE IT.","I adored this class! Took it senior spring and was the best decision! You learn so much about what makes an intriguing story, what things work and don't work. Not only do you get to read a lot of excellent published short stories, but you get to read the work of your peers and learn from the brilliant Bret about little writing tricks. Learned so much and I'm so glad I got in--it's tough to get into the class, but if you do, don't think twice--take it!","This class is fantastic -- you will really learn a lot about how to construct a solid narrative.  Put a lot of effort into this class -- the more you put in, the more you will get out!","If you are passionate about writing fiction and feel stuck, this is the course for you. It is particularly useful in honing plot outlines.","Even thought this class is lotteried every year, keep trying.  Honestly, if you don't try, something need be fixed in your schedule.  Bret fosters an amazing environment for all students.  Even though the class is 3 hours, I hardly noticed since everything that we talked about in the class, ranging from our own experiences to the stories we read, was so interesting.  We were treated as writers, not students.  The distinction is so profound that if you should take the class to experience it.  We study the creative narrative in all of its facets, eventually being able to create and mold something of our own.  Bret is the freggin' man.","If you want to learn how to write prose fiction, then you want to get into this class. Put aside a winter or summer break to compose a really stand-out application piece. Write for at least an hour a day. If you think the other students applying to the class are writing for two hours a day, write for three. If, after putting in everything you have, you don't get in, apply again. I didn't get into a creative writing course until my second application, and it was absolutely worth the effort. You may feel that there is a catch-22 to the application process; you want to get in to learn how to write well, but you have to know how to write well in order to get in. Deal with it. Visit the writing section of the COOP, and either buy a few of the books you find there, or take down their titles and get them at the library. If you want to be a writer, if you really want to be a writer, do what it takes. Be aware that it gets more, not less, intense once you get in. You will be focusing not only on your own work, but on others' as well. I cannot stress enough that this class is worth all the late nights you will put into it. Bret Johnston is an excellent teacher; he doesn't B.S., and if he thinks something isn't working, he will tell you so with no reservations. If he likes something you did, however, he loves it, and will tell you so. You cannot help but be a better writer after taking this course.","This course is amazing. Bret is amazing. Your fellow classmates with be amazing and talented. You will truly get as much out as you put in.","I loved this class. Bret is great. He is personable, funny, and engaging. His teaching style is casual, which is essential, in my opinion, in creating a safe and comfortable learning environment to give and receive feedback on creative writing. 10 out of 10."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to any fiction writer who has never taken a class like this before or been in a workshop setting. The great thing about this class is that Brett lets you work on whatever type and length of story you want, including a novel if you are so inclined (although the course is heavily weighted towards short stories). There isn't a heavy workload but it is important to do the readings every week and especially once we start workshopping each others stories, to really dedicate enough time for reading and rereading the stories, and writing up a review sheet. That being said, those things don't take up too much time, which is really nice and allows you to spend plenty of time writing and revising your own story.","i loved everything about this class. Bret is wonderful, and the group of students represented so many different writing styles and interests. this group pushed me to be a better writer for sure","This class is amazing. If you get in, take it. It's a lot of work, and I would only suggest taking it if you are willing to really give your all to everything. But if you are willing to put in genuine effort, you will without question become a better writer, reader, thinker, and critic. Bret is awesome. He is one of the few teachers I've had at Harvard that is 100% dedicated to his students' work and that can always be depended on to tell it how it is. If your stuff is working, he will tell you how much he admires and loves it. If it's not, he will tell you that straight out, too. I really felt that my brain was working in new ways that I never knew it could while both working on my own writing and reading the writing of my classmates. In terms of getting into the class: work really hard on your application. Really think about why you you love writing and spend some good quality time on your writing sample and also your letter of introduction. Taking some time during winter break or the summer to work on your application is definitely worth it!","This isn't just a class about writing.  It's a class about learning how to read, how to look for clues, how to get inside the head of your audience and craft the best short story possible.  Bret can talk for hours about fiction, and throughout his presentations you're consistently entranced by his knowledge and love for the craft.  Overall, the best class I've taken at Harvard, with the best professor imaginable.","Brett is fantastic. You will learn so much. You will become a better writer. And you will meet some great people in the process!","This class is what you make of it. Bret's feedback can be sparse, and class discussions can be a bit general (e.g. 'this is how plot works in fiction'). That said, the class is useful in that it doesn't require much busy work at all, and so you can devote as much (or as little) of your time to writing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand this can be tremendously valuable.","I came into this class incredibly excited, but I have to say it disappointed me. Having this workshop on my schedule made me set aside time to write, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m grateful for that, but I felt many aspects of the workshop weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite working as they should be. Our weekly classes felt unstructured, and throughout the semester very little attention was paid to the words my peers and I put on the page. Bret had lots of insights to share, and I so appreciated the opportunity to learn from him, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that the class had his full attention this semester.","If you ever can, take this class. Bret is the best, and you will not regret it."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is one of the best classes I have ever taken. The creative writing department at Harvard is phenomenal - definitely take a class if you have the chance. This class in particular was enjoyable for several reasons. Bret has amazing anecdotes, both about life as a writer in general and about his own specific experiences, which are often hilarious. You will receive invaluable feedback from peers and have a great time reading their work as well as the work of accomplished short story writers. Hopefully you will also grow as a writer. You will certainly receive the tools and the tips on how to create a mindset conducive to creative writing. If you get in, take this class!!! It is not too demanding and, for the work you put in, is incredibly rewarding.","Workshops are always great, but BAJ's probably stands out.  He's a master not just of writing, but of teaching how to write.  This class was excellent.","Fantastic class - Bret's a discerning reader and a great instructor, and the other students' commitment to discussion makes peer critiques the best part of the class. I definitely came away with a better understanding of fiction writing craft.","Bret is an amazing workshop leader. You will leave every class wanting to run back to your room and write.","This is a transformative course that will stay with you long after it's over. Bret is an absolutely amazing writing instructor (and a super cool guy). He'll teach you how to read like a writer and show you how to write like one, too. The workshopping process was incredible. I've never seen a group of people so lucidly take a story, deconstruct it to its bones, diagnose problems, and work together to propose solutions. It was the best constructive criticism I've ever received on any of my written work. One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. If you're fortunate enough to get in, take this course. Do whatever you can to get in. Practice writing over a vacation or during the summer. Work hard on you application. You won't regret it."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Bret is an excellent and engaging professor, and basically treats his students as equals. From day one in the seminar you're given the title \"writer;\" in his class you're a writer, not a student. This class is just an unbelievably supportive and enjoyable environment no matter how much writing you've done. I really recommend it to everyone.","AMAZING COURSE! Definitely take this class if you are interested in learning how to write. It is absolutely worth your time","This is one of the absolute best courses I've ever taken. Bret is brilliant, everyone in class was fascinating and insightful, and there was so much respect and good vibes all around. I grew tremendously as a writer and reader and thinker (even just looking at my writing from the summer!) and just benefitted so much from every single workshop class. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!","Bret is the most down to earth guy you will ever meet. His philosophy towards writing is one which you will want to be exposed to. If Bret could become a little bit more \"into\" this course, meaning take a bit of a more guru role for us as writers, this would prob be the best creative writing course. A little bit more passion and rigor would really make this course something special. Not that it wasnt a special experience - I would by all means recommend it - but it needs a little bit more umph to become truly amazing.","Great workshop for those interested in the traditional, straightforward approach to the fundamentals of crafting a short story. Bret creates a very positive and productive environment for workshop and is a wealth of knowledge about the art of fiction. However, expect that most of your time in this class will be devoted to reading and providing feedback for your classmates, and not as much focusing on your own writing.","If you want to develop or improve upon your creative writing skills take this class! Bret is awesome.","If you're lucky enough to get in, definitely take it. It may be the only class for which I actually did all of the readings because they were so fun. I would procrastinate on work by doing homework for this class- no homework has ever been so enjoyable. My classmates' writing was so impressive, and it was amazing to put down their stories and just think, \"Wow.\" Bret gives concrete strategies for writing, which is very useful, and not something I could just learn on my own without a professional writer-teacher.","This class is emphatically worth taking: Bret is cool, our section was engaged and collaborative, and you'll come out of it with something like a finished product. Do be prepared to be self-directed about your writing, though. Aside from your one workshop, final deadline, and a couple of small assignments at the beginning of the course, the task of choosing to write is on you."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH Crr","course_id":"1476","cat_num":"1893","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH Crr","course_id":"1476","cat_num":"1893","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH Crr","course_id":"1476","cat_num":"1893","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
