But, you sit through it because you have to in order to get to something more interesting.","Take it only if you have to","ONLY TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU HAVE TO.","This class is improving; my experience in LS1b was not nearly as bad as some of the stories I heard about it in spring 2007.  However, it needs to become more coherent, better organized, and more useful\/interesting before I would recommend it to anyone not required to take it.","The only reason I would suggest for someone to take this class is to fulfill a requirement, otherwise I would avoid it.","The class is manageable, but it does still require a lot of work, especially at the end of the semester with the Genetic Disorder Project.","Avoid at all costs!","This class is not riveting or fascinating, but it is a good introduction, and they give you a lot of help along the way if you need it.","Great course!!  What I found particularly refreshing was the midterms and exams.  Unlike many courses here at Harvard, I truely feel that your grade correlates with hoe much time and work you put into studying the material.  Unlike some courses were you take the exam and you have no idea what kind of questions they are going to throw at you and often even if you study for hours can receive a poor grade because the question itself was unclear, this course is fair.  The questions are just like the practice problems so if you study hard and do all the problems and review the questions before the exam you will do great.","I wouldn't tell them to take it unless they had to.","I doubt anyone would take this for fun, since people usually take it for the Life Sciences and related concentrations, so I would say enjoy it as much as you can, especially the parts that attracts you, and use your resources. The preceptors' office hours are great, and they want you to visit them because it's boring to sit in an office all day, so do if you have questions. LS 1b is a ritual process; make of it what you will, and you will get proportional benefits out of it.","Be ready for some independent research to clear up concepts that were explained poorly.","Labs are really interesting!","take it only if you have to","If you can avoid taking it, then don't take it.","Take stats first.","You'll have to suffer through this class if you are pre-med, so you might as well suffer through it with your freshmen peers.","LS 1b is a good, but not a great, course. It provides a good introduction to genetics, evolution, and that \"side\" of the life sciences, but although the material is very interesting, the course is not as well taught as I would have liked it to have been. The labs are good but the quality of TFs very variable.","This course is a somewhat basic and flawed introduction to genetics.  Only take this if you really want to learn about genetics or its a concentration requirement.","It is pretty poorly organized and sections are not very helpful.","worst class ever taken at harvard.","Learn to do the problems. That's all you actually need to know how to do, all of the other knowledge is sort of optional.","Like everyone else, I'd say, take this course as a requirement.\r\n\r\nFor interested students, make sure that 1) you're REALLY interested, 2) you look over the syllabus so you know what's going to actually be covered (don't idealize it!), and 3) You have a lot of time to devote to this course...","This class is very well organized and ran smoothly throughout the semester. The lectures are relevant, helpful, and engaging.","Take it for a Pre-med but realize that it is a class that requires a lot of work and is incredibly competitive.","Tough class but worth it","There is some interesting material, and while the class is very manageable if you keep up with","The course material is very interesting, once you understand it. A lot of attention should be paid to lectures in order to do well in this class.","While you learn a lot from the class, a lot is expected of you.","Do not take as a core or elective","The genetics part of this class is interesting and informative; it tails off during the second half of the course (the professors who aren't Hartl), though, when you may see astonishing percentages of the class asleep on their benches at Sanders Theater.","Take this class if you want to take the most poorly structured class I've taken at Harvard thus far.","I enjoyed this class more than Life Sci 1b, though I know a lot of people disagreed. If you like evolution and genetics and want a good intro class, this is it; better than some of the other intro sciences because it is relatively focused in the subject material.","Don't take it unless you have to.","The course is necessary for many concentrations, especially if you are pre-med, however, it is more of a necessary evil than anything else.","find a way to waive this course","Take this course if you need to, but realize that it is a good deal of work and that you need to look for help if you are having trouble.","I would tell them that basically everything other than the practice problems was completely pointless.","It doesn't matter whether I would recommend LS1b to you or not - you have to take it.","For someone who wants to go into health or genetic research the course offers a great introduction into how genetics and genomics affect the world we live in. But it's not easy. I would never recommend this course as an elective or as a way to discover if the sciences might interest you. This one is definately for those who are certainly interested in the sciences and need to be fulfilling requirements.","I would tell students to be prepared for a class that (unfortunately) takes fascinating material and breaks it down into boring and dry components, presented in an unclear manner.","Of all of the concentration requirements that I have had to take (as intro courses), this has been the most informative and interesting of the group.  The professors know what they are talking about, and really seem to enjoy being there, my TF was very helpful, and the material itself was interesting.","This has been the worst experience of my life.","Take this class because you have to","Take it if you have to, if you don't you won't have missed much by skipping it.","if you can get out of taking this class--do it!","The readings are essential.","It's still a new class and it's not quite organized yet.  It can be overly confusing.  The preceptors and TFs and professors are all working on it, so maybe it will be better in the future.  It sort of frustrated me a lot though, and if you're not pre-med I wouldn't take it.","I recommend it if you're interested enough in the material to commit to putting in a lot of work. If you don't plan to put in a fair amount of time, don't expect to learn the material just by attending lectures and sections.","This course really highlights the potential for treatment of genetic diseases.","It is what it is. C'est la vie.","Don't do the readings unless you have trouble with the concepts. Attending lecture without coffee, gum, and a friend to kick you is unwise.","Not as interesting as it sounds.","Be sure to commit and be ready to spend lots of time.","Take it only if you have to or if you are interested.","Although some of the material is uninteresting, overall, the class is well-taught and it provides a good introduction to genetics and biological lab techniques.","Interesting course. Good as a pre-med requirement, and quite enjoyable.","It's a lot of work and not very organized.","It is kind of required if you are pre-med.  I wouldn't take it just for fun but I actually did learn interesting things and evolution is an interesting topic.","Seemed that most people who took it did so because they had to.  I would like to see a more basic biology course analogous to AP Bio for people who don't have that.  Assumes lots of knowledge that people don't necessarily have, but there is no other class available to prepare for it.","I felt that I was learning most of the material on my own. I felt that I was working backwards with the practice problems (looking at the answer first and then trying to figure out how to solve it).","More work than it's worth.","If you want to get the most out of this class, you should do as many practice problems as possible and talk to the professors.","The material was interesting but everything else about the course was unsatisfactory.","Life sciences 1a is very different than LS1b. LS1b is harder, not as well taught, and one must be self-reliant to do well. This self-reliance is a good thing, and even though the course could be taught a lot better, learning this skill is in some ways worth it.","You have to take it if your are majoring in the sciences. But otherwise, stay away. Also, if you are majoring in the sciences, don't be thrown off of the sciences by this course. Try to recognize that it is only Life Sci (and Phys Sci) that suck. Everything else is awesome.","The course feels unorganized and the lectures are hard to follow.","You think it will be an interesting science course but it's really just a math course in disguise! The exams were all pretty much problem based with perhaps a maximum of 10 conceptual questions.  It sucked.","Although the course is not structured the best way and may not be the most interesting (on initial appearance), the material learned is absolutely necessary.","It is incredibly disorganized - it jumps from one topic to the next. Do not take this course if you want to gain an understanding of genetics - only take it if you want to learn statistics.","If you find the material interesting, the class will be good, if not, it may be torture.","The material is interesting and makes the class worthwhile, in spite of the sometimes boring lecturing and the pointless assignments.","a lot of filler work.","The course material in this class is interesting and useful, especially for science concentrators. However, students may not agree with how the material is taught, both in lecture or section. The review sessions and help for exams are not very helpful.","Make sure you have a good TF and if you are dissatisfied, then switch.  Stay on top of the work, though the reading is not required to do well.","The labs are endless, boring, and irrelevant.  The lectures are good, although you have to teach yourself a lot of the material on your own.","It is not very well organized. The material is interesting but it is not taught and reviewed cohesively.","Work through as many problems as you can.","If you have to take it, you have to take it, as is the case with most people in it, but if not, well good for you.","It is a good course for introduction to genetics and evolution, but for those with previous course experience in the subject area, it tends to be slightly on the slow\/boring side.","Lectures seemed pointless at times because of the fact so many different examples applying to the real-world were applied.","I did not particularly enjoy this course, but it is necessary for Life Sciences concentrations and a pre-med track so you have to take it.","you learn stuff.\r\nbut it's not really what i would call a \"good time\"\r\n\r\ni'm sorry you're pre-med.","The course needs to be more organized and better taught.  It's not hard to get something out of the class, but the day-to-day workings of the class are not well-structured and make it hard to learn.  Often what we learn in class seems irrelevant to what we're tested on, and is full of experiments and examples that make it harder to see the bigger picture.","I would avoid this class if at all possible.  It was horrible and took up all of my time this semester.","While the class can be annoying, you do actually learn a lot and much of it is useful. Do the practice problems!!","Don't take this class if you can possibly help it.  It is quite possibly the worst class I have ever taken and have hated every minute of it.  The lectures are boring, the practice problems do not help that much for exams, the exams are long and hard, and the lab portion is deplorable.  Worst of all, you will have write a Genetic Disorder Project that is truly a waste of time.  Unless you really want to be a geneticist, I would say stay away from LS 1b.","GDP is useless.  The textbook is sort of useless as well.","It is the worst class I have taken at Harvard thus far.","This course covers a broad range of topics.","The class will probably be better than when I took it.","If you don't have to take it, don't. Take something else that's taught better, even if it sound less interesting.

Also, the one and half hour long lectures have more text and less animations than in LS1a, so they are more soporific","It's not an easy class, but it's worth it in the end.","The material is interesting!","While this is a very challenging course, you will learn a lot, and have to be on top of your academic game to do well. Be prepared for a very comprehensive and seemingly hodgepodge like course.","Be ready to do a lot of work on your own","The class fluctuates from lecture to lecture in its tolerability, but overall it is a bore.","the material is interesting, but it is still a large intro science course with inherent flaws","If you're not a pre-med, dealing with the pre-med atmosphere of the class can be exasperating.  That said, this paired with LS1a gives you a really good background in a body of material that is going to be increasingly relevant even to the average citizen in coming years.","Do not take this class unless you want to fall asleep during mind-numbing lectures and would enjoy seriously questioning what possibly induced you to take this class.","The course presents some very interesting aspects of evolutionary biology and genetics that were enjoyable.  The problem sets are easy but the readings are dry.  Labs are fun but sometimes take a very long time.  The genetic disorder project was not tied together well.  Lectures are well done.","This class is not as boring in lectures as LS 1a, but it is still an impersonal, massive intro science class. The topics are varied and not too difficult, but don't take it unless you have to for a concentration. It will not help you appreciate life sciences.","Take it only if you absolutely have to, or if you're very interested in genetics and genomics.","Some very interesting material--but tons of work and often boring lectures.","If you have to take it, do some mental preparations. Know that you will spend a lot of time pouring over stuff on your own. Go to lots of office hours for help. If you don't have to take it, take something else.","Please save yourself the pain of this course. It is absolutely terrible. Only take it if it's a requirement, otherwise stay away, please!","Do all the practice problems!!!","The grading in this course is difficult.","you must be interested in the topic to take it, if not it will be the longest\/ most painful class you have ever taken","Just by doing all the psets and studying claculuation, you'll probably only get a C avergae on the tests. In order to do well in this course, you must entirely focus on REALLY UNDERSTANDING the conceptual aspects of the science behind what is taught. That part is really difficult considering what is taught in lecture and section is the MINIMAL knowledge you need, but not enough to apply it unless you're some super genius.","It is worthwhile, but not entirely enjoyable.","Worse class you can take as a freshman. Almost as bad as expository writing.","I took it as a science core. You probably shouldn't. If you're a science major, though, it's probably quite interesting.","I would love to tell you to stay away from this course, but sadly it is a concentration\/Pre-Med requirement for a lot of people.  I only took it for the requirement.  If you are into statistics, I hope you enjoy it.  I really think that this course needs to have a major overhaul or be eliminated from the concentration requirement altogher.","The class is difficult and takes a lot of time, but you will come out with a thorough understanding of genetics and evolution.","This class is geared toward freshman, and I would not advise using it as a pre-med requirement unless you are a freshman.","Do not take this class. Change concentrations if you must. The worst class I've ever taken.","It is difficult to pay attention in class because the teachers and subjecst are not always engaging, and the large lecture format is definitely not for everyone.  The GDP project is too involved.  I regret taking this course.  If you took LifeSci 1a and did not like it, do not think that this class will be any better.","The labs are really interesting!","Very hard exams and problem sets.  Need to put in  A LOT of effort to make a good grade.  Constantly worried about the class.","Doing the readings will really help if you're having trouble - but doing the practice problems is essential to performing well on the exams.","The main thing is to Do practice problems","Be ready to spend your time on nothing else but life science.","Take it if needed.","Take it if it is part of your concentration or for pre-med, but it is not one of those classes that you enjoy.","Stay on top of the reading and do all the practice problems at the very least. Study groups are critical.","Make sure to seek out help from TFs or professors' office hours when you are confused or need to learn the methods needed for problem-solving.","It sounds pretty cool at first, but the lack of organization of the course can drive people crazy. The GDP may also be a bit of a strain.","take it only if you are sure that you can commit yourself into putting a lot of extra time - this course will certainly much more time than some others like chem 20 or chem 17 for you to get full understanding. On the other hand, what you get to learn here is simply exceptional and perhaps the broadest basic knowledge one could possibly obtain at this level","LS1b is poorly taught and confusing. Lecture is long. You'll learn way more from your own studying and perusing of the lecture slides after lecture than in lecture or in section.","Take it only if you have to. For me, pre-med req.","Parts of this class weren't that interesting but overall it wasn't too bad. Also having a good TF is essential for enjoying this class.","Do not listen to what other students tell you--LS1b is not a terrible course.  Many say that it is worse than 1a, but I feel the complete opposite.  Do not let others prejudices alter whether or not you take the course :D.","The course material is interesting, but the lectures can be boring sometimes, and if you want to succeed, be sure to do as many of the practice problems as often as you can.","The material in the class is difficult, but it is very well taught and worth the effort. The GDP project is time consuming and at times difficult to keep up with because of exams, problem sets, and lab reports that are also due throughout the course, but in the end it is very rewarding.","This course provides a fundamental background in genetics and evolutionary biology. It covers a broad range of topics that will broaden your thinking both on topics of genetics and evolution.","It's an interesting course overall, but it does have its rough spots that will hopefully be smoothed over in the near future.","1B is a reasonable class if you do the readings and the problems, and if you practice the problems.","I don't think it's well taught, but you will learn material that you should know.","Only take it if you absolutely have to for a concentration that you are basically certain that you are going to follow through with.","is more difficult than you would expect, important to put in the time; lectures are a bit arbitrary, and a lot of busy work","Out of everyone that I know that took this course, I can think of one person that actually enjoyed it.","Only take this course if you absolutely have to for your concentration. If you can get around it you should. I know a lot of people who lost interest in science in general because of this course.","This class has a reputation for being a terrible class, but it is not true. However, I would only recommend it if it is a requirement.","Do the practice problems to get the grade\r\nKnow what you want besides a good grade from the class and don't let the class push you around.","Only take this class if you need it as a requirement. It is not particularly difficult if you put a decent amount of work in but it is not engaging.","If you can find a way out of taking LS1b do it.  Otherwise, prepared to be depressed.","Definitely take it if you need to for concentration or premed. It is a good, challenging Core. Enjoy GDP.","i wouldn't recommend it but its required so everyone will take it anyway","The material is interesting but there is an unnecessary amount of work.","LS1b is a class you should take only if you truly love biology, because the large lecture size and uncomfortable seating in Sanders Theatre makes it hard to stay awake and take notes.","It's a good Science B core or elective if you are really interested in Genetics, but they take up a lot more of your time than is necessary.","It lays the foundation for genetics and evolution that you will need in your later science classes","I wouldn't recommend this course to people who just want to take a science class. However, if you are an MCB concentrator, this is required. The class was good for teaching basic genetics and was therefore useful. That said, the class is not structured for people who want to casually learn genetics \"for fun.\"","Since the class is often a requirement, not many students have much of a choice in taking it, but to future students I would say I hope that through the new system they tried this year and the Q evaluations that the course is good in the future.","It's good to know the fundamentals of genetics, and this course seems to do that.  I really learned a lot.","Do not take as a core.  Time consuming.","Do the assigned readings before lecture!","Only take it if you have to. Also, if you do the practice tests you'll be fine on the midterms.","Don't take this course unless you absolutely need to take it to fulfill a concentration requirement. If you are doing premed, but don't need this for you concentration, you would probably enjoy MCB 52, MCB 54, or pretty much any other biology course a lot more.","This class needs some work but you'll get through it.","Take it only because it is absolutely required for some concentrations. It's sad that I should say this about something so interesting as genetics, but maybe so many students are turned off by Life Sciences at Harvard because these classes are not well organized or taught.","The class will help you in further science concentrations at Harvard even though the subject matter isn't inherent in the specific concentration you are looking at.","Take this course if you have to, but make sure you take advantage of TF office hours and the practice problems."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Don't take it if you can avoid it. If you have to take it, well then it's not that much of a grudge. Genetics is something you have to learn, even if taught unelegantly you will learn things in this class.","If you don't have to take it, don't.","Only take this course, if you have to for a requirement.","Very boring","The class is not particularly difficult, but that doesn't mean that it will necessarily be painless.  The Genetic Disorder Project will always be lying in wait behind all of the other work in the class, with the deadline looming in the distance.  In addition, the lectures are hard to stay focused on.  They are not the most entertaining events, and a typical sleep-deprived college student may have trouble remaining awake and alert.  The bottom line, though, is that the course does teach some valuable information about genetics (and statistics, though stats isn't part of the course title).  If you are pre-med, this is a required course and shouldn't harm your GPA.","Don't take this course unless you know you want to be a science major.","Most people take this class because they have to. The lectures are poor, and you probably won't enjoy the class. One piece of advice is that you need to be on top of the material to do well.","Do practice problems and you will be fine.","This class has some great subject material that is interesting to study.  These methods are actually used by geneticists and lay the foundation for any study of genetics, so this is an essential class to take for any biology or life sciences concentrator.  The teaching quality is variable, but the subject is engaging and interesting to learn.","Unless you absolutely have to take this class for a Pre-med requirement, or are extremely interested in genetics, this class is tough and consumes a lot of your time so I would not recommend it.","The class is a very comprehensive overview of genetics and evolution. I would recommend it to anyone interested in further studies in biology.","The class is not too difficult, but some parts are tedious.","Life Sciences 1b definitely has its ups and downs. On one hand, the concepts can be very engaging if one is thoroughly interested in the subject, but it can be tedious to do certain unnamed projects throughout the course. It can also be difficult to grasp concepts with a syllabus that seems to involve a lot of skipping around with only vague established connections between concepts.","You will probably learn more in this class than you have in any other class so far, but be prepared to put forth a lot of effort to succeed.","This class is necessary if you are planning to be a pre-med.  That being said, after having taken this class, I have decided to continue on the pre-med track but to not concentrate in any type of science.  If this class is any indication of what other science classes are like, then I could never put myself through four years of misery.  Take advantage of the extra credit opportunities, because you will need them.  The class is set up in such a way that no matter how hard you try, you end up needing a curve or scale in order to receive an acceptable grade.","RUN! Avoid if you can. I was lucky that I had an awesome TF, but you need to really evaluate yourself before taking this class. it's tough","Take it only if you have to.","Do not take this course unless you have to for your concentration. There are some fun labs, but the material is covered slowly, and the staff like to micromanage several of your assignments, especially your Genetic Disorder Project, where they tell you exactly how you need to do it and leave no leeway for your own thoughts. It is also highly bureaucratic and full of red tape, with the teaching staff often making you go through a chain of people to get anything done.","Would only take if you have a serious interest in biology or want to fulfill pre-med requirements, you need to spend a considerable amount of time outside of class in order to do well but the class is manageable if you stay on top of things","It's nothing like LS1a, but the professors mean well and the resurrection policy gives you the opportunity to do well.","It's just not that good a class. Nothing like LS1A, which is a much better learning experience. Lectures are very dry and dull, sections are poorly run, and the GDP project seems out of place in a class like this. I recommend taking another class to fulfill the pre-med biology requirement.","I would tell students to take this course only if they have to take it or if they really, REALLY like Biology. Yes, I did enjoy the course material and yes, the course staff did a very good job of being available for students throughout the semester, however, I really found the course to be a lot more stressful and a lot more difficult than it needed to be because of the Genetic Disease Project and because of the way in which the course material was tested. If I had the option of not taking this course, I am not too sure that I would have taken it; however, this class was not all that bad either, so on the other hand, I would not necessarily tell students not to take it.","It's necessary and useful if you're majoring in it, but there's better courses to take if you just want to fulfill a gened requirement.","I'm sorry you have to take this class. Maybe, by the time you have to take it, they would have actually listened to the course evaluations and done something about how painful this class is.","There is a lot of very interesting work of genetics that is covered in this class. If you keep up with the reading and you attend lecture on a regular basis, you can definitely get a lot out of this course.","The information content is really interesting, although in lecture it was sometimes not presented well.","Take it if you like genetics. Don't take it if you do not like genetics.","DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. It is a waste of time and effort which could be much more adequately spent in more constructive OEB\/MCB classes which you can use to replace it.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IN THE SAME SEMESTER AS PS1!!!! The lifesci 1b exam occured the day after the PS1 exam not only once, but twice! The scheduling of this classes assignments and exams were never convenient and hardly ever seem to be thought out to take into account the PS1 assignments, even though they were aware that half of the students in lifesci 1B also took PS1.","This is the type of class where if you get behind on the reading or problem sets, it is very difficult to catch up. There is a lot of memorization required but you will learn all the basics of genetics and evolution.","Do the practice problems. Its the only way you will actually learn anything.","ONLY take it if you are really interested in the material. If you have to take it for pre-med, find another class that satisfies the same biology with lab requirement.","Look for another class if you don't absolutely need this class for your concentration.","Way too big- and you have to teach yourself everything.","The course is not difficult, but it's also not very enjoyable. Just do all of the practice problems, psets, etc. and you'll be fine.","The best thing about this class is that your grade is a product of your preparation. You learn to do the red book problems, you get a good grade. The worst thing about this class is that, unless you love dry lectures and superfluous labs, it takes up an absurd amount of time that you probably want to spend doing other assignments.","I would tell future students that LS1B does not have to be taken to fulfill the pre-med requirement they seek. Other classes like LS2 would do fine as well. That being said, don't take LS1B.","Ls1b is focused on problem solving and the quantitative aspects of genetics, which is actually really interesting. Otherwise, the class is terrible. It is a a relatively easy pre-med requirement, though. Lectures are a great way to catch up on sleep, the Genetic Disorder Project (GDP) is by far the worst assignment you'll ever do at Harvard, and no partial credit is awarded on exams.","This class is not fun and it will constantly give you grief, but every once in a while they mention something mildly interesting and relevant to everyday life","Generally straightforward course if you put in the effort consistently","Only take if you need to.","You will have to take this course to go into the Life Sciences or if you are Pre-Med.  The course is organized, but in a way that will demand all of your time and attention just to keep track of what you have to do, let alone do it.  Good luck.","The material is very difficult and it requires a lot of personal time and effort outside of class to teach yourself the material.","Much of this course seems to be more about learning to take the test rather than knowing the material.","The material is very interesting, but this is on the whole not a great class. However, the vast majority of students taking it have to for their concentrations.","Hope you get a good TF.","Be ready to put a lot of work on your own in.","Only take this class if you have an extreme interest in the subject or if you need to fulfill a concentration requirement.","It doesn't really matter if I reccomend it or not. If you're taking this class, it's probably because it's required for your major\/pre-med plans.","Avoid this class if at all possible. It shouldn't be as difficult as it is, but with the abysmal quality of teaching, and the unhelpful texts, the material is somehow completely opaque. Good luck - you're going to need it.","You will learn a lot of interesting, applicable-to-daily-life material in this course.","horrible lectures, but you need to make the most of it. read the material, do the practice problems, and work hard.","The lectures were not very helpful at all, and all the learning takes place in section.","Try to find a way to NOT take this course, because it was possibly the worst course I have taken here. It was consistently unorganized, boring and repetitive, and yet required a lot of work.","The material is wonderful, the lectures could be better, and you'll learn a lot, but because you'll be teaching yourself the foundations for the class. The amount of resources available for the class are tremendous and will save your life, but you have to juggle a lot of different things at different times to fit your schedule. The class was a minor headache for most of the semester, but at exam and GDP times, a big big headache. Like I said though, if you listen to evan and keep up throughout the semester, you're all set.","It's required for everything...so....yeah.","Make sure you are flexible with the concepts in the test.","Stay on top of practice problems and the readings.  Review material after class.","terrible terrible terrible you think life science 1a is bad, this is worse","This class is really hard to pay attention to.  The professors try to make the material more interesting but it's really a struggle to pay attention to.","Pre-meds will probably have to take it. Everyone else: avoid it at all costs! I honestly hated it.","I would only recommend this course if you need it to fulfill pre-med requirements. This course is not indicative of the sciences here at Harvard, and it is sad that so many freshman judge future classes off of this one. This class is extremely difficult, since you learn most of the material and necessary problem solving strategies solely in section or by yourself.","If you have to take it, take it.","Just take it.  But don't expect great things -- in fact, it's terrible.  If you don't know anything about biology, you'll find it very hard.  If you know a lot about biology, take it as an easy class.","Red book problems are essential to your success in this course- do them! Lectures are uninteresting. You can easily just review slides at home. Sections are great though it really does depend on your TF and how well he\/she reviews the material. Lab experiments are pretty elementary and there's a lot of busy work involved in this course.","Be warned, this class seems extremely appealing as it fulfills a lot of science concentration pre-requisites and a pre-med requirement. However, if you are planning on taking other time consuming classes please be warned that this class will monopolize a lot of your time.","I found this course somewhat pointless, but some interesting material was covered.","This course does a good job of applying math and problem solving to biology concepts, but is not a good class if you are simply interested in genetics.","This class is going to be very boring and will not challenge you. The problem sets are spoon-fed to you by the PSL's. Tiny details count just as much as the broader portions of the course, which really serves as a detriment.","This class consists of two main parts: the lectures and section. Lectures, contrary to what some may think, are actually helpful if you listen carefully. Sections are also very helpful, but for different reasons. The exams this semester were mainly multiple choice on facts and then a section on problems. While section\/lab helps significantly with this problem section of the exam, the lectures really help with the multiple choice portion. Beware, however...the lectures are hard to stay awake in at times...and once you fall behind, it is so, so hard to catch up again. Especially if you are taking ps1 as well! There is a lot of overlap between the two courses in terms of exam times, so be prepared! The Genetic Disorder Project can be time-consuming (in terms of when you have other classes to worry about) but it's alright. Just make sure to do things ahead of time. :)","This is probably one of the worst classes at Harvard.  Only take it if you absolutely have to (which, because of concentration and premed requirements, you probably do).  You can try to game it, but don't expect to learn much, despite the interesting subject matter of genetics.","Do the practice problems! There's a lot of material, but it's doable. If you don't need to take this class, don't.","The material is necessary to learn, but at times painfully acquired.","Abandon all hope ye who enter here.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.","You should take it if you're interested in biology or medicine, genetics in particular.  As an elective, I wouldn't recommend it.","Do not take this class unless you are required to. The material is really interesting but the way it is presented is extremely confusing and convoluted.","At times, this course seems like a chore to do work for.  However, try to keep as open a mind as possible.  The course material itself is very relevant and can be extremely interesting. However, some of the assignments do consist of busy work--though their intention is to introduce you to the wealth of resources out there such as NCBI and OMIM.","Your red book is your bible and basically the course is a disaster so do not feel bad.","Only take this class if you're going to do pre-med.  There are many other biology classes more interesting than this to take if you don't need it.","It is sad that you may be required to take this course, cause it is not a reflection of what your concentration will be like. I have met few people who can honestly say they enjoyed the course. The material is interesting, but the course itself is terrible.","Be prepared to do a lot of busy work for the class.  Definitely go to the preceptor's or Head TF's office hours and try to do each week as lectures and the book are often unclear.  If you can identify and troubleshoot problems that are difficult for you from the beginning of the course, you'll have a much easier time preparing for the final.","If you don't have to take this class, don't. No matter how interesting the material may be, the professors will find a way to make it much more boring and difficult than it actually is.\r\n\r\nOh, and Christov is one of the best TFs you could ever ask for. Harness his wisdom.","Deliberately take the time to do the practice problems.  This is the best way to learn the material and understand the concepts of the course.  Plus, most of the exams resemble the practice problems, so it is good test preparation.","This class is full of busy work and is a complete waste of time. Everyone in the class is taking it to move on to real life science classes in sophomore year. The lectures are boring, and Prof. Ruvolo literally reads straight off the slides. People are there to do the clicker questions, but you can learn just as much without going to class. The GDP is a pain, and sections are horribly boring.","This class covers the basics of genetic inheritance and disease, and if you are interested in a science concentration you should definitely take this class becuase its a requirement, but don't let it frustrate you or discourage you.","Don't take it unless you absolutely have to","If you don't have to take it, then don't.","Study and you will get results! LifeSci is not impossible! <3","The concepts taught in lecture usually require reading over multiple times; sections and office hours are very helpful","The course is not great, but it isn't as horrible as the Q guide comments say in the previous years. It's a little less good than Life Sciences 1a, and the professors are much less engaging. Still, the material is interesting, and you shouldn't skip the course just because it is rated poorly; go for it, and all will be fine.","The lecturers are not as bad as many people make it out to be.","Hit or miss - if you keep up, it's not really that bad at all.","You probably have to take it, it's probably good for you, but it won't be the most fun","How much of your soul are you willing to cut out and sacrifice to your pre-med vision? If you hope to succeed in this course, you must be willing to sacrifice all of it.","I really enjoyed the probability, statistics, phylogenetic tree distances, and other mathematically related areas of this course. If you don't enjoy calculating numbers and learning statistical methods, this class may not be that interesting for you.","Be ready to study and put in A LOT of time working.","This course sucks (not because of the materials but because of the humdrum professors, who tests their students unfairly) but you have to take it anyway if you are concentrating in Life Science subjects.","This course requires that students work hard to understand many complex concepts, but, if students do this work, they will find that this course gives them an extraordinary understanding of many phenomena vitally important to humanity.","The information covered in this course is pretty interesting, though fairly challenging.  The lectures are less than exciting, but the second half of the class is better than the first part, in my opinion.  I'm sure there are better OEB and HEB courses at Harvard, but this is a requirement, so suck it up and study hard.","It's interesting, but way too much work.","How much you enjoy this class is going to be pretty strongly tied to how willing you are to do the work and pay attention, and how good your TF is. So make sure you get a good TF.","Make sure you try your best to seek help when you don't understand the material so that you can keep up in class.","It is a lot of tedious work.","Practice problems help the most in learning the material and preparing well for exams, more so even than reading through lecture notes.","Take it if you have to. It isn't as bad as people say and is fairly well organized so that you can do well if you work hard. Although it was not my favorite class as I did not enjoy lecture, I did learn a fair amount.","Take it only if it is required for your concentration.","It's necessary for Life Sciences concentrations and fulfills a biology pre-med requirement.  It won't be fun, but it's not too difficult either, and you'll need to get through it to go on to better biology classes.","Many people will take this course because it is required for pre-med. therefore, I will not say don't take the course. However, I will warn you that you are going to have to work extremely hard to teach yourself the material because lectures can be confusing and sections can be confusing as well.","This class is a requirement for many science concentrations. Be prepared for lots of work.","If you are taking this class to fill a requirement look into the other OEB\/MCB possibilities before deciding. They're not very well known, but there are actually classes that can substitute, and that you may find more to your interest.","I would tell students that this class is very time consuming and that you must pay attention to all details mentioned in lectures because they can be tested on.","You need to take it at the right time so you can ignore the typical freshmen grumblings about the class, which are really annoying and unjustified.","stay organized, there are so many things to keep track of.","It was a great class. I got to learn about the different components of what make each person unique, and I feel more fulfilled with this knowledge.","Sometimes the work seems like extra leg work but it all is fine. The class is pretty good but I will admit my TF made it all worth it.","Unless you have to take this class for a concentration requirement, CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE. There is no reason to take it for pre-med or for general education, as there are FAR better options available that can fulfill the same requirement. The lectures are bland and professors often seem disengaged, as though they're reading off a slide. Exams are surprisingly difficult. Classic case of a large \"required\" class that has been allowed to exist in mediocrity for too many years.","If you are going to take this class, be prepared to be frustrated often. Be sure to keep on top of your work and do the practice problems as soon as you can, and always before the exams.","It is unfortunate that LS1b is taught so poorly because the course material is actually very interesting.  If the teaching staff were to increase the level at which the course is taught, the class would be improved immensely.","Do practice problems.","Unless you are taking this class as a Pre-Med requirement, then you are better off picking an easier class on the same\/similar topic","I came into this class excited about the subject and interested in learning more about it and left it wishing I hadn't taken the class and hating genetics. :(","Lecture is boring, though material is interesting.  Exams are tough, but the genetic disorder project is fascinating and great practice for real-life grant proposal writing.","It sucked.","The stress in this class comes from the micromanagement of the instructors. They give a million small assignments that don't count for much so you need to constantly stay on top of your material which is not easy to do.","It's boring, difficult, not at all interesting, but necessary if you want to go into medicine","It's really useful material, but it is very detail oriented so be very careful with that.","Its a necessary evil.","The material is pretty interesting when read, but is not so much in lecture (not exactly the professors' fault- hard to make evolution seem that exciting in person. Recommend that you bring your textbook to lecture and read it there.","Do not ever take this class unless you absolutely have to. It makes a potentially fascinating subject into something tedious and dull. The lectures try to cover too much material in too little time (and tend to linger on concepts that are irrelevant except for a single multiple choice question on one exam). The practice book and psets are an accurate representation of the what will be on the test, but you won't learn how to do these problems unless you have a competent TF. If you have to take this class, having a strong TF is the only way you're going to do well.","Make sure to stay on top of the reading and\/or attend lecture. Studying for exams actually involves a lot of time and effort. Also, take advantage of TF office hours and help sessions; Friday problem solving sessions may or may not be the best use of your time.","It is a difficult course to take with PS1","be prepared to be bored","Watching the lectures on line was easier than going to class but then you don't get the clicker points.","This class gets a lot worse rap than it probably deserves. I really was put off by some of the problem sets and labs, which treat you like you're back in high school (i.e. some trick questions that don't really test your understanding, a decent amount of busywork). However, the professors did a really nice job putting together the material, and the material (if you actually gave it a fair chance) was really interesting. This is a required course, so many will have no choice in taking it, but if you do, know that lecture is the best part.","The class is very manageable with enough effort.","Be prepared to do a lot of annoying work and get surprised by the exams.","Be serious about science if you take this course.  This course is the first stage in weeding out the pre-meds & science majors from those who aren't serious.  If you only want to do science in college as a hobby, this is not the course for you.","Only take it if you have to.","This class is a lot of work, and I really regretted taking it.","There'll be some fun parts if you can get through it.","I profoundly regret that you have to take this course.","You need to study a lot more than you think and you need to start studying RIGHT AWAY!","Take it.  Study hard, and you will see the many ways you can apply the knowledge learned in LifeSci 1b to other areas, including your own research, if you've gotten to that stage!","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL REGRET IT.","I think this class was a great introduction to the principles of genetics; however, I'd only recommend taking it if you need to fulfill a pre-med requirement or have a lot of free time and are slightly masochistic. It's too much work to be worth it otherwise. If you're interested but don't have the time, I'd audit it.","It is very logic-heavy as opposed to memorization-heavy.","It is very badly organized. The readings are not too helpful. You don learn a lot though.","Do the readings as they are assigned. They are crucial to understanding the material, especially if you don't have a strong background in sciences.","Always do the practice problems. Try your best to keep up with the readings. Reading the book actually helps.","I only took this class because it is a pre-med requirement - otherwise, it was too overwhelming","If you don't do every single practice problem every week, you will really fall behind.","Only take it if you have to, there are probably other genetics courses that are more interesting.","It is okay, but not too great. Sections are somewhat painful.","This class requires much work and dedication on the student's behalf; with time to teach yourself the material.","Do not take this class unless you ABSOLUTELY have to for pre-med requirements.  It is very poorly taught and unless you are an expert at biology, you will struggle a lot in the class.  There are too many people in the class who are strong in science, so if you need help on basic concepts it is difficult to get the help.  I would definitely stay away from this class if at all possible.","Its difficult. If you need to take this class for your concentration, I would you need to stay on top of the readings and material. If you are taking this class as an elective, I would recommend you don't.","If you need it to fulfill a requirement, then you obviously have no choice. If you really like genetics, then you will probably really like this class, but if not, it's just another requirement you have to get through.","If this class isn't a requirement for you, don't take it. Lectures are poorly delivered and the material is often poorly taught. Exams aren't that difficult, but they certainly aren't easy, and the GDP project is an incredible waste of time.","Due to the large, impersonal lecture, your experience with the course depends 100% on your section. Your TF will either make or break the course.","Do not take this course until the ratings have improved.","Come to class and pay attention, do the redbook, and study everything, even those useless details because they will be on the midterms.","take it only if you have to; it's a very strenuous course - requires a lot of self effort and self studying.","The materials covered in this course are incredibly interesting, but the lectures are sometimes very boring and difficult to follow. Nonetheless, this class is definitely worthwhile if you want to learn the subject. With a good TF and a willingness to spend time doing some of the reading and practice problems, there is a lot you can take away from lifesci1b.","too much information. difficult to know what is important. not well organized","Do the red book problems. Also, don't forget about the Robertsonian translocation. Just don't.","There is a huge emphasis on memorization in this course. The first third is deceptively nice and math-based, but becomes more focused on facts as the course proceeds.","The material in the course could be quite interesting. However, with a few exceptions, lectures were rather dull and too long to maintain your interest. Though weekly expectations (labs, problem sets, practice problems) were pretty reasonable, the exams were much harder than we were prepared for and included different types of questions than we had been introduced to. If you're going to take the class, make sure to do the practice problems- they help a lot, especially because you will be left confused by the readings and occasionally lectures. Though the first part of the course is very mathematical\/statistical and not the most intriguing, the second part is more interesting and understandable.","You've gotta push yourself to stay focused in lecture and keep up with the work. If you do you'll be fine, but it's very easy to fall behind.","Only take this class if you absolutely have to.","The class itself isn't so bad, the work doesn't take up too much time (although GDP had mixed reviews on its worth), but wary of the exams because if you don't prepare well it can be much more difficult than you expected.","Interesting subject matter, only take the class if you are truly interested in the subject, otherwise material will seem boring and you will slack off.","Make sure to keep up with all the material","At times it seemed daunting, but if you read and do the study problems you will do fine!","You need to take it even if you don't want to.","Focus on problem solving, study conditional probability","Although somewhat dryer than LifeSci 1A, 1B is an interesting, well-run genetics course.  It is not hugely difficult, although staying on top of the material is highly recommended, but covers a wide range of gene-related topics.  Obviously this is somewhat of a special interest course, but for those who like genetics, this is a very good class to take.","This course feels like a requirement - it doesn't feel like a class you would take for fun or out of pure interest, even though the content of genetics is very interesting.","Unless you love genetics and stuff like that, don't take this class","Be prepared for a lot of math-based problems.","This class is one of those classes that you must take as a requirement for pre-med or any biology concentration. I feel that the class gets such a bad reputation because the lectures are terribly boring, which is a combination of the lecturers and the material. I mean, I actually found myself enjoying taking the exams more than sitting in lecture. Moreover, the genetic disorder project, while very useful in teaching you to how to write up a real research proposal, will have you pulling your hair out because it requires so much work. Overall, it's best to just take the course, and then forget about it.","It's a shame that you have to take this course for pre-med.","Not a bad course, but the workload is a bit much.","This course is great if you have a preexisting interest in biology and if you're up for the challenge, but if you're on the fence about science this class could potentially turn you off from it.","Keep up with reading.","The lectures are not very interesting but section can be helpful","Plan to study and learn the majority of the course material on your own.","IT IS TOUGH!! the red book is very helpful! Go to your tf's office hours.","I would try to satisfy requirements with a different and more personal class","The exams are the worst part of this course. A large portion of your grade is not based on conceptual understanding, but rather memorization of random facts.","Be prepared; it's not a joy to take this course. It's hard to stay on top of things, and the material is often boring and difficult.","DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Dan Hartl is one of the worst professors, ever. As much as he may be a great researcher, his book and lectures are completely uninteresting and somewhat scatterbrained. I came into this class hoping to learn more about evolution and genetics, fascinated by the two subjects. Now, all I am left with is contempt for the subject.","This class is very boring, but it's required for a lot of concentrations and is a prerequisite for a lot of classes, so if you have to take it, you have to take it.  Definitely don't take it as an elective.  On the bright side, it's a pretty easy class, and very little work (if you pay attention in lecture, you probably won't have to do the readings, though it's a good idea to do a few of the practice problems before starting your problem set).","Not a fun class.  Please take it only if you have to.","The Material is annoying and the exams are hard.","It made me appreciate Life Sci 1a","Look, the course is difficult because it covers a lot of material that can be hard to visualize. However, it is probably THE most applicable course you can take if you are planning to study medicine, since you need a command of this material to understand medicine nowadays. My best advice is: do the practice problems and keep in mind throughout that what you are learning is really really useful and will help you in your future. You can do it!","This class is a neessity for many concentrations but it very difficult to get through.","This is not a very good class; try to take another biology class if you need it for a premedical requirement.","The lectures are boring, the practice problems are a lot like the midterms (they throw wrenches into the actual midterms though), and the class is not my favorite","This class provides great insight into genetics and evolution.","The class is not particularly exciting, but it is something that you have to take, and it is not very difficult.","Take it only if you must.","Studying lecture slides and practice problems are KEY for the midterms, which are pretty tricky. Reading is extensive and not always necessary with the lecture slides available.","A lot of information is covered in this course in a short period of time, and the multiple choice\/short answer components of exams are very difficult.  This course also requires a lot of different types of work - there are weekly problem sets, midterm exams, two short papers, a group presentation, quizzes, lab reports, a final paper, and a final exam.  The lectures often cover material too quickly and can sometimes be very boring.","The lectures are boring. Your experience really depends on your TF. I had a fantastic TF while other people hated the course because their TFs were pretty bad...","only take it is you absolutely need it for the pre-med or concentration requirement","very boring- take only if necessary for premed requirement","The course material is interesting but hour and and half lectures can be really difficult to get through. I would only take this class for a requirement there are most likely much better electives for science requirements.","Only take this class if you absolutely have to.","You learn some interesting stuff but overall the class isn't the most exciting or engaging. GDP is pretty fun.","Interesting material, but very badly organized and covers a lot, so you have to work hard to understand how everything fits together","It's not the best, but most kids in it have to take it so we all just power through. A good TF makes the class MUCH more bearable.","Its not a great course, but for the number of courses that require it, its not that bad (its better than expos).","Do all the red book problems if you want to succeed in the class!","Problem sets and exams are notoriously tricky, so make sure you pool together or else you will do poorly in this class. Go to lecture!!! Even though its boring you will benefit.","Dear children. Be organized. Do the practice problems. Lecture becomes less useful as time goes on but your TF (if you get a good one) will be indispensable, and as long as you can keep up in section each week, it'll be great.","I would not recommend this class unless you are interested in further pursuing science majors. The class is challenging but teaches you a lot.","A life sciences pre-req.","It is paramount that you do the practice problems and the readings. The problems are your bread and butter, but it is those nit-picky fun facts in the reading that can work against you come exam time.","Just stay on top of your sh**, and be aggressive in asking questions. You can't go wrong asking questions. And even if you don't understand all the reading, just try to do as much as you can, because it will form some sort of primer for the lectures and problem sets. Also, PSLs (peer study leaders) will be your best friends, so definitely take advantage of their hours. You can do it!","Do the practice problems. Do not take this class unless you have to.","Lectures are not helpful. Section and PSLs are.","Do not take this class. If you are interested in HEB then pursue a different road to that goal because this class will surely end your interests in the course","In order to succeed in this class, make sure to do as many practice problems as possible. Try to complete all of the red book problems.","This is the worst class I've ever taken. Ever. Do not take it unless you either have no soul or hope to lose yours.","LS1b is necessary if you want to be pre-med or if you want to concentrate in some sort of bio, but honestly this class was a pain. Tons of reading, the GDP takes time, and there is a lot more actual work than LS1a.","The lectures in the first half of the semester before evolution are not very interesting, but it is important to keep up. If you do end up falling asleep, try to rewatch the videos. Doing practice problems are also a great way to study for midterms. The multiple choice on the midterms are dangerous though, as they are 5 points each, and they usually test on random information briefly discussed in class.","Make sure that you study on your own and spend extra time learning the material...just attending lectures and doing psets will not prepare you for exams","Be prepared not for a class of challenging material but for a class jammed packed with information, so stay aware and constantly try to absorb facts.","This class is not one of the more interesting classes you'll take. Only take it if you need it for your concentration.","Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.","stay away if at all possible. If that is impossible, then just focus on working with your teaching fellow to get a good grade because neither the lectures nor the textbook will help.","Not as good as I thought it would be. I was really excited by the idea of learning about genetics, but the way this course is taught does not make it interesting at all. Did not enjoy this class.","you will be bored out of your mind. but it doesn't take up much time.","I thought I was going to concentrate in the life sciences but now I know I will not be doing so. In a way I am thankful I took the course because otherwise I may have been stuck concentrating in something I really do not like. It is probably not the fault of the course but the material for me was uninteresting. The class is a real pain unless you are very enthusiastic about topics such as genetics and I think you should only take this if you want to concentrate in the life sciences , and that is simply because you have to. There may be other parts of the life sciences that are very interesting but now I just do not want to take the risk of taking a class I cannot stand for another semester. It was personally a chore, and classes should not be like that. However, if you love life sciences, go for it.","The class is challenging.  There are a lot of problems and there is a lot of work and it requires a real time commitment to succeed, but if you do them all, you are SET for the exams.","involves math and statistics and students should have background info to do well","If you are able to keep up with the class in terms of completing the textbook readings before lecture and doing the weekly extra problems, you will do well in the class and enjoy what you learn in the class.  However, this is very difficult to do considering how busy the average student is and the bulk of material that is covered.  I found I had to do a lot of catching up right before each of the midterms and finals.","Rock on.","This is a necessary hurdle if you are pre-med. But the professors and teaching staff do everything possible to make the material interesting and to find creative applications of it for course assignments.","the material for this course is very interesting.  however, the teaching is rather confusing, so you need to study on your own to do well.  you do come away with a lot of knowledge about genetics and evolutionary biology though, and there are many people who can help you and answer questions.","This class sucks","This class, while necessary, has the potential to be very interesting. The material is oftentimes very groundbreaking and incredible in its applicability to modern science. However, lectures are given in a way that distills the information simply from the textbook in a very boring fashion, which is not helpful or engaging as a student in the course. The class is certainly less engaging than Life Sciences 1a, although it certainly could be more interesting if it were redesigned and reassessed as a course, which I believe needs to be done.","A fair intro course, but -- when it comes to human genetic variation, don't swallow all of the claims uncritically.  Realize that a fully balanced treatment of this issue is impossible for any American university professor with an interest in job security, and look into \"The 10,000 Year Explosion\" (Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending) and Razib Khan's GNXP blogs -- not perfect, but a good start for anyone wondering whether we really are \"all the same.\"","Hopefully by the time you take this class, it will be different from my experience. Prepare to learn mostly on your own.","You have to take it. Just suck it up and do it. Everyone else does.","If you take this class, be sure to do practice problems for the exam and learn the basic facts. Also find a general review article from pub med to help you with your GDP.","Take this course because you have to. Otherwise, there isn't much reason to take it. I wasn't blown away by it. You learn some valuable things, but it won't be your favorite.","Take it only if you must as a concentration\/pre-med requirement.","Do the practice problems. They are similar to the pset questions and you'll have the answer key online to help guide you.","Many of you may feel like you have to take this class to fulfill a requirement... I encourage you to search for alternatives.  Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.","IF you need to take this course, take it--it's certainly not difficult.

However, with so many components to the course (weekly problem sets AND weekly labs AND semester-long project), it takes up a lot of time.","I would only recommend if you have to take the course.","it'll make your life miserable and hope that something terrible happens in evolution so nobody else will ever have to take this class.","Read the book!","go PSL help sessions, the PSLs are very helpful and explain how to do the problems well. also, don't fall behind in reviewing weekly material.","Do not take this class. If you're thinking of being pre-med, try to find some way around taking this class. LifeSci 1b is the worst course I have ever taken, and if you have any respect for yourself and your sanity at all, you will not enroll in this course. It sets a new standard and performs as a paradigm for exactly how dreadful a class can possibly be.","This course is something you have to take, probably not something you want to. You are treated like a high-school student: incessant clicker questions, quizzes, boring material... There is no continuity in this course, and even in the lectures themselves.

Whether or not you enjoy it is another thing entirely.","IMPORTANT!!! If you're not planning on concentrating in the life science you do NOT have to take this class for pre-med requirements. There are other options! \r\nThis is a terrible class.","it is very difficult and the exams are very hard","Many people believe that this course is poorly taught, but I disagree. The lectures are interesting and explanations are understandable. The big problem with the class is that it is poorly organized. Questions on midterms and problem sets are often ambiguous, meaning that your grade relies on your ability to read the mind of the preceptors as well as mastery of the course material. The GDP project is highly regarded by the preceptors and they use it as one of the major selling points of the class. I found it thoroughly frustrating because it involves trawling through paper after paper looking for scraps of information. The amount learned from this project is too small for the amount of time that it takes.\r\n\r\nIf at all possible try to stay away from this course!","Run! As fast as you can if you do not have to take this course. The only reason I would suggest this course is if you are pre-med or if this is a concentration requirement or if you really, really like genetics. This has to be the worst, uninteresting class I have take at Harvard. The work is tedious, the lectures are boring, and the professors do not make this a worthwhile class. If you are a decent student and you care, you will get through this class. It's not so difficult and most of the concepts are common sense. However, it becomes increasingly hard to care about this class as the semester wanes. Also, if you take this exam, study for the final exam, hard! Your final exam can make or break your grade.","need to do the readings in order to keep up, it's a challenging course","Only take this class under two conditions: pre-med requirement and\/or concentration requirement. Only take this class after you are ABSOLUTELY positive that you fulfill one of those conditions. If not, there are much better science classes that aren't as convoluted, boring and demanding.","Try to keep on top of the readings if possible. You probably will not though. It helps to take notes when reading when you finally do it. Also, try not to lag behind with practice problems either.","It's like amputating your leg if it is infected. You don't want to do it, and you will be maimed in the end...but you have to do it, and you WILL come out alive -- maimed, but alive nonetheless.","Unless you are absolutely certain that you will be a pre-med or concentrating in any of the life sciences, do not take this course. It is crammed full of information and can seem overwhelming at times. The GDP, which provides you with a rich knowledge of genetics in action, becomes incredibly tedious and therefore loses much of its purpose. There is simply too much material taught at too rapid of a pace.","Even if you loved Lifesci 1a like me, you will still hate Lifesci 1b. Don't be fooled. Or hopeful.","If the professors who teach the course change or they change their style of teaching, then the class would be much better. The actual material isn't what makes this class boring - it's the way in which the material is presented!","That this class is one of the most ridiculous science courses.  I do not feel like I was actually taught the information.  I feel like slides were read off to me and I was expected to learn the information on my own time.  I did not find lectures useful at all.  Section was the only useful part.","This class if pretty challenging in terms of the material and the way that it is taught. You will need to put forth extra effort to pay attention and extra motivation is required on the part of the student to do well. The material is not made easier by the professors.","The material is interesting but the course is a lot of work.","This course is tough and there's not much help unless you ASK for it. Do problems, get extra help.","Try not to fall behind on the readings. Be ready to learn and figure out stuff on your own time.","complete the practice problems, go to office hours, and bug them until you understand","This course just doesn't work. The information could be interesting, but the way it is taught is disjointed, confusing, and not good. In the end, you'll learn a lot, but its not fun while you're going through it.","It's not a terrible course, but there is a lot of material that takes time to digest, so go to lecture and stay on top of the readings. The genetic disorder project also isn't bad if you plan ahead. The exams sometimes ask for smaller details so thorough reading is necessary to get full credit.","n\/a","Just bear with it, a lot of things could be worse in your life.","Only take this course if you have to. And take it conjunction with PS1, so you can kill two very painful birds with one stone.","Unless you are taking this class for a pre-medical requirement I do not recommend it.","This is a pre-med \"weeding-out class\"","It is so boring and uninspiring that many people never go to lecture.","An incredibly unpleasant course. You'll need to devout so much time for it. Each week, you will have to work on its PSETs, GDP-related stuff, lab reports AND prepare for lab quizzes. Simply too annoying.","I wouldn't recommend this course if its a GenEd choice.","The class teaches useful information, especially in terms of the application of statistics, but do not judge the life sciences courses\/concentrations based on this course...","Stay on top of concepts and do practice problems.","Its difficult material and a lot of work for a class, however, its very interesting and absolutely crucial for any studies in the biological sciences.","Take this course if you have to but it's not something to take just because you think you might want to learn some interesting things about genetics and evolution.","You might hear horror stories about this class. I personally really enjoyed it. I think the professors are good lecturers though you often hear otherwise. The material is not really all that difficult if you're willing to put in some minimal effort. I would really recommend it.

The material is fairly easy, and if you put the time in to work practice problems before the midterms, you'll do fine.  The GDP is a bit of a pain, especially since it's a lot of fact regurgitation.","The course material is very interesting and the focus on real research gives you the flavor of many different fields of science you may want to pursue later down the line.  The only downside to this course is the you only end up being tested on a small subset of what you learn, and the exams and problem sets can be rather mechanical rather than thought-provoking.","I mean, you have to take this class for almost any life sciences class. You don't have a choice. I would not take this class for my Science of Living Systems gen ed, though, if I had a chocie.","If you hated the material in LS1a, then you may not like this class.

This does not have to happen to you! Unfortunately, this class is a requirement for nearly everything. So suck it up, grit your teeth, and put a decent amount of effort into this class and it won't be too bad.","Though genetics is an interesting topic, I felt like in order to do well on test, I needed to just be able to do problems, not actually understand the concepts.","Is not a true biology course but mostly stats; avoid if you can unless you love stats","practice problems!!!","This was my least favorite class at Harvard so far.  The only good thing about it was that so many freshman take it that there are lots of people to commiserate and do problem sets with.  It's not super challenging, so if you're premed or need it for your concentration and don't mind being bored out of your mind, it's okay.","Don't do it. Lectures are uninspiring and the class will drain you of your sanity. Lectures are read straight from the slides, the book does a horrible job of explaining concepts, and it will leave you insanely frustrated. However, the psets are super easy.","This class is all about your commitment. The information is boring, and you really have to teach it to yourself if you want to do well. That being said, you can do well if you are willing to do it all yourself.","Lectures are boring. Prepare.","This course throws a lot of material at you, but it really only asks you to learn a small part of it in a very specific way. Also, don't freak out about the GDP. The professors and the TF's may not really prepare you for the project or give any useful recommendations before you start it, but the first two predrafts are really just practice and the total project isn't even worth that much of the grade. Finally, I would recommend that students not take this course unless they are ABSOLUTELY SURE they need to. There's always time to take it later. I met plenty of sophomores and even some juniors taking it. If you're not sure that you need to take it, I really recommend taking another course you're interested in.","the course material is interesting if you are truly interested in genetics.","This class will introduce you to the basics of genetics in a pain-free way. Lectures are a little boring sometimes, but easy to follow. If you go to section and really learn how to do the practice problems, there's no way to do poorly in this class.","This course is no Life Sci1a and those strictly wanting to learn about how an organism works should not take this course. However, if you are interested in working with genes, gene therapy, or medicine this course would be useful","I didn't really enjoy it, but it wasn't terrible. Just never really clicked."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class will teach you a lot, and the material covered in lecture is extremely interesting. That being said, be aware of what you're getting yourself into. Section is excruciatingly long and normally pretty boring, the tests are hard, the GDP project is annoying, and the p-sets often are difficult. For the amount you learn in this class, it's worth it, but just barely.","This course was really engaging and interesting...Make sure to take advantage of all the help that is available to you in it.","This course covers very interesting material, and the professors are all great. There was often a strange disconnect between what we learned in lecture and what we needed to know for psets and exams - frequently making the course frustratingly and unnecessarily difficult - but I think this can be improved upon. Overall I definitely recommend!","If you need the class, then take it, but keep working through out the semester. It will be challenging.","Sections matter a lot in LS1B because the professors can't go into much detail during the actual lecture. Much of what ended up being important to know for the exams I learned either during section or from Practice Problems. Lectures in this course, I feel, are more for showing the cool side of the subject material.","So most science majors and premeds will have to take this class, and hopefully the instructors keep trying to improve it. To do well, you need to have a strong understanding of the terms they give you and know how to do the specific types of problems they give you. Definitely do all of the practice problems because the more you do, the faster you will do them on the midterm which are crunched for time. The final was mostly explaining as opposed to the midterms which were mostly problem solving. They give you broad meanings of the terms they want you to know, so you need to ask how they will show up on an exam. Overall, I think it improved from last near but still needs a lot of work before people start to enjoy it.","You learn a lot of stuff about genetics and evolution, but not a big fan of how it was presented. I didn't feel like the course was consistent. However, I did love the lecturers and the lectures individually.","you will learn a lot but make sure to try and find your own understanding of the structure of the course because no one will give that to you","This class is definitely very difficult but the key is to stay on top of your readings and take really good class notes. If you do that you'll see that by the time tests roll around, it'll be easy to put together study materials.","Simply attending class is not enough to success in this course. Going to problem solving lectures and approaching it as a problem solving class is a better way to think about the course.","I guess I have to recommend this class, since it's sort of a natural start to science here. But be prepared to want to die. At least Dr. Berry is cool...","This course is necessary, and sometimes boring. It is manageable if you keep up with the work.","This class is good, but it is far from perfect.  The teachers are great but the class still has some kinks it needs to work out.","Not my favorite, but not as painful as it's been in the past.  The problem sets aren't bad, get a good TF and lab won't be painful.  If you're considering taking this class, you probably are required to so just accept the gift of Andrew and Hopi and deal with Maryellen.","You have to take it if you're premed, so be diligent about learning the material during lecture to retain it for the exam","Basically, if you are even reading this it's most likely because you have to take this class.  The subject matter is pretty dull and honestly way to \"microscopic\" for my liking...  We really don't cover a whole lot of evolution.  The teaching staff does a decent job at trying to make the material exciting.  But it is hard to sometimes navigate their different teaching styles.  There are resources available to help you.  Take advantage of them. AND XINDAN IS THE BEST TF I LOVE HER!!!! She is the only reason I didn't fail this class....","This class is near the worst class you'll ever take at Harvard. Sorry pre-meds. At least it's getting better...","This was a horrible class.","I doubt that anyone takes this class just to take it; it's just one of those hard pre-med courses. Make sure that you review both lectures very well each week so that you can understand the problem set. This will prepare you for the exams so that you don't have to cram as much when they come up. Be sure to do your reading for the weekly lab quizzes - they are often unpredictable.","The new class is amazing! So good and totally worth taking!","Don't underestimate the quizzes and exams.","Great lecturers.","This class is a great intro to genetics and suitable for people interested in this field.","LS1b is a tough course to organize by virtue of its material--it's hard to organize all these facts and methods in a coherent way that doesn't seem like flooding the students with useless information. The lectures, problems, practice problems, and exams do not fit too well with each other yet. While you do learn a lot in the course, it is also a lot of memorization and you will need to do a lot of the work yourself if you desire to understand these concepts. Nonetheless, the teaching staff is quite decent (I really admire Hopi for her lecturing ability!) and if you get a good TF you can really learn quite a bit. They are all dedicated to helping you understand the material--it can just seem frustrating at times because the course doesn't have a well defined\/emphasized direction yet.","Unfortunately it's a huge lecture class required for most life science concentrations. You'll be lucky if you get a TF that knows what's going on or is willing to dish out a 30\/30 on a problem set once in a while. Expect problem sets to be poorly worded, confusing, and ambiguous with answers. Just bite the bullet and do it, though it won't be enjoyable by any means. Hopi and Andrew's lectures aren't bad but good luck paying attention with Mary Ellen.","This class is too difficult. It is designed to favor the gifted students, but not the dedicated ones. I came into this class with only LPSA for a Biology background, and I was tred upon. Although I am Pre-med and am dedicated to learning this material, there were too many other students who came to the class already knowing more than I had heard of and were, therefore, unduly given a leg up.","If you're taking this class, you probably have to take it anyway, so reviews probably don't mean much. That being said, this is a fine class. Judging from last year's Q reviews, it has improved substantially in comparison to previous years. I am pretty interested in biology and genetics myself, and I had no problems with this class. Some of the material is truly fascinating; some of it is dry and seems pretty useless. I'm not sure how much I actually gained from this class- much of it I already knew, and much of what I didn't know was equations I have a feeling I will never use again. I'm sure I gained at least something from it. Some of the labs (testing your own DNA to determine your relationship to your classmates, observing C. elegans mutants) were really cool. Problem sets were no problem. Tests were usually fair. Of course, Andrew Berry is a riot and his lectures are always hilarious, which is a plus. When the material is boring, the professors do make an effort to keep you interested with things like short video clips, some of which are really cool. This wasn't as good of a class as Ls1a, but it was perfectly acceptable for a large pre-req class.","Genetics is a developing field, which makes it all the more interesting. Much of the material is based on recent developments in research, and for me that's very interesting because it's something I'd like to pursue. The lectures are dense, but the professors can teach it in a way that's memorable and interesting. Study hard for the tests, do the problem sets with minimal aid, and you should be all set for a great semester.","Lectures are awesome.  However, it's easy to fall behind, so go to office hours if you don't understand things.  Casey Loehrig was one of the preceptors, and she's incredibly effective at intimating concepts.  Her review sessions on Friday are also quite helpful.  Study hard for exams.","Pre-meds need to take, can take as much as this class as you put in above an beyond.  Really try to clarify what you need to know as the details which seem too detailed are always tested and not the obvious concepts.","I should preface this by saying that this course is inevitable for most life science concentrations, so there isn't much choice for pre-concentrators like myself. Regardless, this course has interesting material in principle, but the way in which it is presented could be improved. Because of the breadth of material covered, the lecturers move through some concepts too quickly, and thus the section component becomes critical to succeed in the class. The exams are very difficult and this is compounded with very harsh grading. Study a lot for the exams because they are meant to produce bell curves - they are made to throw people off so that the 500+ people don't all receive good grades. Keep up with the reading if possible and check problem sets with peers (same as in any other science course). Most people I have spoken to think that this class had the potential to be much better, and in the future it may reach that potential...","It gives a great overview of non-molecular life science. There is a nice range of organismal and human components. While you don't go into many things in depth, it can help you find a more specific area of interest.","You have to take it for pre-med and most science concentrations so just push through it.  Got much better this year.","This course is logistically extremely flawed and can create a lot of frustration at times. That being said, the professors are good and teach the material well. Take advantage of professor office hours to really help understand the material. If you get put in a section with a T.F. who does not help you to understand the material and I mean really comprehend the principals then SWITCH!!!! My T.F. was the only really good thing about this course.","So, I don't know what the course was like in previous years, but overall, I enjoyed the course, so they did a good job re-vamping it. I think genetics is an intrinsically interesting subject and the professors did a good job of bringing up interesting examples in class relating to whatever we were studying. \r\n\r\nI would reccommend students at the very least look at the slides from the review sessions; I found them helpful when studying for the exams. \r\n\r\nOh and, I don't really think you need a textbook. I don't think I even opened mine all semester. If I felt unclear about something, I usually just googled it and that was always good enough.","From what I hear, it's a lot better than it has been in the past, which is heartening. It's still not a fantastic class though, but it won't be the worst thing you've ever done.","For a large introductory class, LS1b totally rocks!!!","I think this class's reputation makes it out to be much worse than it actually is. It's a difficult class, but if you go to lecture and make sure you understand what's going on, you'll be fine. Work with other people, go to the problem set sessions, talk to your TF, and get help if you need it! Really interesting material, and the professors are great! If you're a premed you'll enjoy this course.","You're going to take it, because you have to, but you're going to have a bad time.","This class is a great introduction to higher level bio concepts. The tests are hard, and make sure you get a good TF; if you don't like yours, try and switch immediately, it makes a huge difference in this class because a substantial amount of the teaching gets done in section.","Well structured course materials. Two lectures a week, one three hour section a week, one pset per week and occasional labs\/presentation. Professors are on the whole quite clear and engaging, but lecture is not necessarily helpful for all students. It can delve into excessive side-tracking or jokes (from Professor Andrew Berry, who is charismatic but often too facetious for time efficiency). Clicker questions require attendance, which is unfortunate for those who find lecture slow-paced. Entire course is focused on the various aspects of genetics, so you had better be interested in it... Midterms and finals are fair testing of material, and quizzes in section hold you accountable for basic knowledge. Course overall not overly work-intensive.","Life Sciences 1b is probably better than previous years because of the teaching staff. However, it is disorganized, vague,and not very rewarding. The tests do not show your understanding or knowledge, but how well you can play a strategic game essentially. That being said, it's a necessary course, and for what it's worth, I suppose it's not terrible.","Very difficult","There is a lot of material. It may not all be organized in the best way. It is to your advantage to think about how all the concepts you are learning fit together.","Pay attention and don't underestimate it, and it'll be a good class","Only take this if you absolutely have to for your concentration.","With the new teaching staff, the course is better than in years past. It was still a bit disorganized this year (e.g. no review sessions before midterms), but that may change in future years as the course develops.","You have to take it because its required for all science, but its a ton of information packed into a small amount of time, an the exams are not fair.","this is an excellent class. the course material in sometimes hard to understand but once you do, you actually learn to appreciate it and see why Dr Berry has so much ethusiasim for the course.","It's an easy way to meet a bio requirement. However, for more rigor, take MCB.","This class is very poorly organized. If you need to take this class be prepared to dedicate time toward organizing the material in the course to learn it. Go to office hours to try to find out how the course grading truly works. I feel that this class is not conducive to learning and is more of a struggle as to how to get points rather than learning the course material.","Although I was not a big fan of genetics to begin with, this course surprised me in a positive way. It's not quite as good as LS 1a because the different parts are less integrated and the teaching isn't as enthusiastic, but it's still a very fine class. And although the Genetic Disorder Project is not a very useful one, but it's an easy way to boost your grade.","LS1B is a perfect example of an inherently flawed course. Even with shiny new professors, professors who are the most well-liked and respected of their departments, the course still falls completely flat. Here's the deal: If you don't have to take this class for your concentration requirements, DON'T take it. It's not that it's hard--it's not; you'll be fine with the difficulty level. What's bad about it is that they literally just present you with topic after topic, as though they're a waiter carrying around a sampler with everything genetics on it, but they're all desserts and you're looking for an entree. That analogy probably didn't make much sense, but ultimately what I'm getting at is that this is a bad course overall. The professors do their best to make it fun, trying to fix the course by playing music in lectures and telling jokes. However, it needs to be fixed at the structural level--a completely re-designed LS1b is necessary for Harvard, and that remodeling must include an arch of knowledge at least attempting to connect the hundreds of independent topics dumped on you throughout the semester. Avoid this course for a few more years.","Much has improved from the past iterations of this class.","It's a great class because of the course material but be prepared to work a lot on your own to understand it all. I'd recommend to additional practice problems and discuss concepts with other people in the class to make sure you really understand the conceptual aspects of the class. Most of the problems and exams will require you to have a good understanding of concepts, not of specific questions.\r\nIf you're considering taking this class as an elective or GenEd course, the material is really interesting and although I had problems with the structure, I did really enjoy the content. It was great to see why we work the way we do and Andrew Berry is an amazing lecturer! Also, the labs overall were really cool and really drove the concepts home.","this is a more difficult course than you think","This course is difficult but the material is interesting.","All about how many hours you put in.","This class is WAY WAY WAY WAY WAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too easy!  I took it as a junior (waiting for a decent change of staff) and I had covered almost every single topic from one or another biology class I have taken at Harvard and even in high school.  I did not study for a single exam, but still managed to score a standard deviation above the mean.  That being said, 50% of the class is scoring below the mean who did not find the class as easy as I did.  I think this reflects a need for even greater change: to half the course and create an LPSB for those students who have less background and feel unprepared to take LS1b.  As it is, I was bored out of my mind and completely unchallenged while others were complaining about how difficult the course is.  This course was a waste of my time (I learned almost nothing new) and would have been greatly improved with an increase in difficulty of subject material.","Do it because you have to","If you're a pre-med you don't really have a choice of whether to take this class or not. That being said, it wasn't bad at all. Andrew Berry and Hopi Hoekstra were great lecturers. Just be careful who will teach you section. If you end up with a section teacher that sucks, change as fast as possible.","This course remains flawed, but probably better than past iterations.","Badly structured, won't inspire any love for the material if you don't already have it and are willing to suffer through it. That being said, it's a requirement for some concentrations, so you may have no choice.","Andrew Berry may draw you to this class, but Hopi is the true gem in the lecture circuit!","A good deal of this class (particularly on tests) is just trying to play the \"hit-the-correct-key-word\" game. I felt like the professors were mostly just looking for regurgitation of what they had taught in class, rather than applying knowledge in new ways. This can get pretty frustrating because it requires much more rote memorization, but if that's your thing, I'm sure the class would be fine.","This class has definitely improved over the 1.8 Q-score and it looks like its on the way up. In a few years, the structure might have been changed enough by the new course heads in order to make this a fantastic class.","Better than last year. Professor Berry makes more jokes than teaches during lecture. Professor Ruvolo is dry and frankly boring. Professor Hoekstra is the one beacon of hope for this abysmal class. Also combined section and lab was extremely long and painful.","Get a tutor early.","Hard class but interesting. Seems like a lot of random topics.","a difficult but interesting class. a lot of work. much MUCH better than how i have heard previous years described","Hopi is by far the best lecturer, clear and concise, and takes feedback very well. Andrew is entertaining. Maryellen is not good. At all.","It's a good course.  You will learn a lot of genetics, alongside its history and the controversy it currently encompasses. It's overall an interesting course. Lecture can be hard to get through a lot of times though....","I would tell them to utilize office hours and the Problem solving sections as they were the most helpful.","It's necessary for pre-med and you will make it through.","Be sure to look over the lecture slides before the exams - the exam questions tend to be unfairly specific","don't expect to understand anything","If you have to take this for pre-med, then do. But it's a requirement. Hopefully they'll continue to improve this over time.","You need to have a basic background in genetics to take this class.  You also  need to be prepared to face questions on the exam that you won't feel prepared to answer.","Although it wasn't the best class I've taken at Harvard, the new professors certainly did a great job re-inventing the course and presenting the material in an engaging way. This course will only get better.","The key to passing this class (and the tests) is to DO AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM SETS. Also, make sure to read the lecture notes in a timely manner. I did almost all of the problem sets using just the material I read in the lecture notes and what I learned in section that week. The practice problems also help a lot.","A very good course now that they got Andrew Berry, who is hilarious. The GDP project is very fun to do. Just keep in mind that the course is difficult (though it is possible to get an A in this course!) and that you will have to put in a lot of time and effort into the class.","Interesting material with good professors but a difficult and disorganized class.","If you don't have to take this class, I would hope you would choose not too. The instructors are a lot funnier but the information isn't more interesting and the lecture slides are disorganized. The GDP project was fun though.","Everyone will probably tell you that they love Andrew Berry and think he is amazing and hilarious and a great lecturer. Yes, he is entertaining, but he does not actually teach. It was frustrating to sit through an hour and a half lecture and only receive ten minutes worth of content at most. Instead, a lot of time was spent dancing and jumping around to make students laugh. This class was definitely being test-run after the abomination it was last year so I guess it is an improvement, but it definitely was a big frustration that it was still so disorganized. Hopefully it will improve by next year.","LS1B is a lot more fun than most people will tell you! Just keep up with the material, don't fall behind and PAY ATTENTION IN LECTURE. Seriously listening in lecture is the key to a smooth ride in this course. The readings cannot compensate for it the night before the midterm. Also go through the concept check and learning goals with a group instead of on your own\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cyou'll be surprised how many details a group of people can remember.","This course is not taught well. My TF even told me that he thought it would be very difficult to get an A unless you got extra help outside of lecture and section, which I think is really unfair, but honestly probably true. The lectures did not really teach a lot. I would not take this class unless you have to, which unfortunately, many people do.","Life Sciences 1b was truly an incredible experience for me. What I truly enjoy about LS1b is that it is problem-solving based. I was able to gain a much better appreciation for the concepts because of this format. I think that one of the key strengths of the course was section. Section, though slightly long, really reinforced the key concepts and helped me determine which concepts were important to remember and take away from the lectures. Challenging but rewarding.","Relatively easy course, especially if you follow lectures closely.","Though the lecturers made a clear effort to improve LS1b, there remains much work to be done.","It is hard, the tests suck, but the information you gain is invaluable.","Putting in a little bit of effort and reviewing the material each week makes the problem sets and exams MUCH easier.","Be ready to teach yourself how to apply what you learn in lecture to actual problems. The lectures focus on concepts and section won't cover all of the problem solving you'll need.","Don't listen to the whiners..this class is really interesting if you like genetics and if you make the effort it is not too difficult. this class is much better than it used to be","They definitely improved LS1b from the horror stories I heard about last year, but honestly, it wasn't a great class. I liked each of the lecturers, and thought that they all taught well, but the psets and lectures do not go together at all. Furthermore, the psets don't really cover the midterms and final exam material, so it was really confusing to study because the class is sort of conceptual but also analytical. So it was definitely not a fun class, just because I was always confused as to what was happening on psets and lectures, and such. Problem is, there isn't an alternative to LS1b, so if you're pre-life sciences, you're just going to have to take it.","If you like genetics, this course will be a breeze as long as you put the work in. The new profs are great!","This class was a lot better than the previous years (so I have heard) and the lecturers are awesome and next year they will have worked our the kinks even more so it will be a much better class. However, this class is much different than LS1a.","While the information covered in the class can be genuinely intriguing if you are already interested in biology and specifically evolutionary biology, the format of this class is hardly a replacement for a more focused seminar that would be better able to provide a positive learning experience.","only take if you are seriously sure you want to concentrate in a life science","The material is very interesting and the teachers this year were all fantastic.","This class is very hard and the material covered in lectures is not exactly portrayed in the homework and tests. This made it feel that going to lecture is  a waste of time since what they tested on was on the optional Friday discussions.","The lectures are very interesting, and it is advisable to check your P-sets with your classmates.","Though the material is difficult, as to be expected, the lectures are engaging and the topic is well taught. Of course, this doesn't mean one can get by without doing further studying outside of class.","Although Dr. Berry and Dr. Hoekstra are entertaining and the lectures may seem interesting, the class is still not well organized and the lecture material does not correlate with the exam\/problem set questions. While studying for the exams, I felt like I was learning all the material instead of just reviewing it.","It's quite amazing how pathetic a course at Harvard can ever be.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, my complaint is not out of trying to justify doing badly in a class.  I scored well above 90 in the quiz and the two midterms.  For me the class was very easy; I spent maximum 1.5 hours outside of class for this.\r\n\r\nEverything you learn in this course will be vague, ambiguous, confusing, and ill-defined.  The Psets are not enlightening but confusing.  They will present you with a concept but never actually explain it well.  Part of the reason is that the course tries to present simplified versions of these concepts, and then fails at it.  Sometimes with oversimplification comes more confusion and even wrong information.  \r\n\r\nThe reasoning for the answers on psets or exams are absolutely ridiculous too; the only reason I did well was because I knew how to play games.  I considered the entire course as a game; when they mention certain words, you just use certain words and phrases to answer it.  There is no thinking nor understanding of the concepts involved.  When I asked them a question \"that reasoning does not work because it assumes this and this, and the assumption is not a valid one either.  How can it yield the right answer then?\" The answer was along the line of \"yes, you are right. but our answer could be the case too.  So we'll just accept ours as the answer and not yours.\" Great. Amazing reasoning that is.\r\n\r\nNow, I do concede that I'm being a little unfair since this is really their first year teaching this course, but unless they really take time to change many aspects of the course, I can tell you that you will very likely go through what I went through.  That is, you'll come to Harvard as a biology passionate person, and by the end of the course, you'll be disgusted by it so much that you consider switching into government major.\r\n\r\nThey really don't care about the course anyway.  After the first quiz, which I did very well on, I in fact sent them an email on how the course could become better.  I wrote 600 words, in detail and with specificity, how the lectures can become more helpful.  They sent an email back saying they'll take my comments into account.  The lectures got only worse.\r\n\r\nLastly, I guarantee you that this comment will not make it to the Q-guide, although it is one of the accurate ones, but I'll share with many people on FB and email so that you will receive the right information.  I'm not complaining because of a bad grade, nor because I'm having a hard time with the course.  I'm just severely disappointed at how absolutely miserable a Harvard course can be, and I just wanted to let you know about it.","This class is really hard and section is boring.","I only took this course because I had to. It was not very well put together.","The subject matter is cool; the class itself is still (perhaps inevitably) massive and disorganized and full of pre-meds, and the quality of lectures varies from instructor to instructor. That said, I enjoyed working with my classmates and feel I got to know people well through the class.","Brace yourself for GDP project, but the lecturers this year were awesome!","This is a great class!  New teaching staff, total revamping, all new and flashy.  Most of the first half or so of this course should be really straightforward if you've had a strong AP Biology and\/or genetics background.  The problem sets are usually pretty simple.  The most useful resource is Casey's Friday review session.  Watch it on video if you can't make it!  She summarizes everything taught during the week very nicely and goes over the problem solving techniques in a clear way.  Being the first year teaching the course, the professors still need to get a better handle on some of the organization of the class.  It was very-well structured, but some of the pacing could have been altered--at times, they seemed to speed through difficult material, and at other times, they would drag on forever about boring stuff.  Also, I don't know if they will change this for future years, but I thought that the lab quizzes that we had every section\/lab were incredibly juvenile and a waste of everyone's time.  I also found little value in the GDP project, as it was mostly just busywork.  Those are the things I have to pick on.  In general, it was an incredible class.  Going into the semester, I only knew one class that I was taking for sure, and that was a statistics class.  LS1b was on the periphery as a backup in case I didn't like another class during shopping week.  I went in the first day and was instantly captivated by the class in a way that no other class was able to do.  Andrew Berry sold that class, and he sold it well.  He is entertaining yet very knowledgeable.  Truly a phenomenal professor.  LS1b has had a major overhaul, resulting in what ended up being the best class I took this semester.","It's impossible.  No matter how hard you try, no matter how may Psets you go over, no matter how many office hours you go to and whether or not you think you know the material like the back of your hand, the exams will ruin you.  Especially the final, the questions were vague, convoluted, and awkwardly written.  If you can avoid the course, I would.  If you can't, god speed.","Lectures and course material is super interesting and the class has improved tremendously from what I hear.  However the class still is not good with p-sets being unmanageable and exams very inconsistent in standard.","Be prepared to go to office hours.","This will probably be the worst class you will take at Harvard, and you don't even get a medal when you're done with it.","It is pretty engaging now.","If you've heard bad things about LS 1b in the past, disregard those now. The new professors are entertaining, organized, and set clear and reasonable expectations for what you are expected to learn, and I felt that I learned quite a lot about genetics in a pain-free setting. The professors also do an excellent job of integrating recently-published research (I remember seeing Hopi post a slide about stickleback fish and then seeing the results of that research published about a week later in Nature... very cool!)","Be prepared to work your butt off if you want to be rewarded with a decent grade.","Make sure to go to the problem solving lectures and learn how to do the problems, because the problems will be tested more than basic knowledge of the material on the lecture slides.","You'll really enjoy this class; the revamp was quite successful.","The class is not very well organized. Perhaps wait a couple years to take it until it gets figured out. The exams are unfair. Go to problem solving lectures!!","This is MUCH improved from previous years, from what I've heard. Prof. Berry and Hopi are awesome, and although Maryellen isn't as good of an educator as the other two, her lectures are definitely entertaining. Problem sets can be vague and worded badly, but overall, they are fair, and the exams aren't bad. It's definitely a fair class that gives you back what you put into it.","It is not as bad as it has been in past years. I actually enjoyed the class much more than I expected to.","It doesn't matter what I tell future students, since so many people have to take it anyway.","If you want to enjoy learning, take a higher level genetics course instead. The course still has many aspects to fix up and can be very frustrating.","After years of bad Q scores they really tried to revamp the course this year. Bringing in new professors like the always entertaining Andrew Berry, it seemed like LS1b was ushering in a new era. However, despite the entertaining accents, and videos, and jokes, underneath it all LS1b was still a disorganized mess and I honestly do not feel like I learned what I should have learned. Lectures were too fast and they glossed over important concepts without really explaining the significance (i.e. how this knowledge would be applied to problems). By the last third of the course, most people had no idea what was going on and we just kind of slugged along hoping for the end. The end also seemed to appeal more to HEB-type people rather than being a general survey of genetics which could have been one of the major turnoffs for most people who weren't HEB concentrators. Maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did but I for one am not a fan of the memorization that the majority of this course ended up being. Most people who take this course feel that they have to because they're premed or doing one of the bio concentrations; it's not really something to take for fun so choose wisely.","Prepare to work extremely hard outside of class.","This class met my expectations. Good lectures, professors are great, psets are actually helpful, etc. The only annoying things were the prelab quizzes (asked about the littlest things) and the assigned readings, which often did not match up to lecture enough for it to be actually worth doing the reading.","difficult, but interesting class. if you are premed you have to take it but the information really is interesting. a lot of material, but manageable in the end","It is very entertaining and well-taught class. Not too hard (easier than LS1A), and fairly interesting.","The course was very well-organized and there was an influx of available resources for me to pool for, especially for exam prep.  Some lectures (especially Mary Ellen's) were rushed material-wise and though there were so many resources for exam prep, it was hard to weed through them considering the midterms seemed very problem-based as opposed to conceptually-based.","Very interesting class, somewhat challenging.","This is really one of the most challenging classes.","This class is not well organized, and frankly, I didn't learn very much. But it is a Life Sciences concentration requirement, so if you have to take it, then do so. I would say that if you have a strong background in biology, you should definitely try to test out of the class, because it won't be worth your time.","It was hard.","There is a huge disconnect between what is learned in lecture and what we are expected to know on problem sets and exams.","The content in the class is super interesting. However, it's easy to get discouraged. It's hard to do well on tests because there is just so much that you cover, and they like to throw in lots of questions that were briefly mentioned in one lecture. Take this class if you have to or are willing to study a lot- just know that it's likely to cause frustration.","Don't recommend it, but you're a pre-med, so it's not like you really have a choice...","Be prepared to study, and take advantage of office hours, help sessions, and practice exams.","Make use of the section review sessions.","This class is a very comprehensive overview of concepts in genetics and evolutionary biology. At times, the material can be dense and the concepts may be difficult to understand immediately, but many lectures (especially those about human evolution) were very interesting. The exams in the class tend to be difficult and can be different from your expectations. Overall, this class is a pre-med requirement that is not easy to get around, so take it and enjoy it (or try to)!","I would tell future students that as long as they use the resources available to them, they can do well in the course. However, they definitely cannot depend solely on the lectures to learn what they need to know. I found that I seemed to learn the most from the problem sessions and within section.","It is a fairly painless class-psets are weekly but short, lab reports are easy.  Midterms were predictable as well.  Even though lectures were interesting, they did not at all correlate to material tested, so make sure to pay attention in lab\/section.","A junior told me that changing the professor might change the tone of the class, but if the preceptors stay the same nothing will really change. And after taking LS1b I found that to be true. It is better than precious years in the sense that the professors genuinely care about the students and almost all of the statistics is gone (except for chi-square which is really    simple). However, the course still had major flaws. Andrew Berry would be phenomenal for a TEDtalk or as part of an extracurricular lecture session, where you learn for general knowledge, not tested knowledge. But his nonstop jokes and multiple pictures and videos distracted from the main content and made lectures fragmented and hard to follow. There was not enough text on the slides and going to\/watching Casey's problem-solving sessions was mandatory if you wanted to know how to do the problem sets. Hopi was a better lecturer, but her slides had so much information that it was difficult to parse sometimes what was essential and what was not. Maryellen Ruvolo has no idea what is going on in the genetics portion of the course, so don't bother going to her office hours for the genetics part of the class. She teaches the last third, and her lecture slides are the best, so she definitely knows her section of the course the best. The problem sets are short (except for the last), so it is possible to do them during the PSL Help Sessions. The PSLs help as much as they can, but bear in mind they don't have the answer key available to them, so make friends with other people in the course to check problem sets with. The Exam 1 and Final are ridiculously long--25 multi-part, mostly short answer questions in 3 hours?!--so make sure not to get behind. It is possible to do well IF you stay on top of things. As this is biology, if you get behind, you will be trouble come test time. There is a lot of information to learn. Casey, while good at explaining things, can also be hard to schedule personal meetings with, and her answer keys always needed to be updated to correct mistakes. The GDP Project was okay--sort of a waste of time, but the symposium itself was great and interesting, so I guess the project was necessary for foreknowledge. The TFs were highly variable in their knowledge--some knew genetics well, while others legitimately didn't know what they were doing (e.g. if Greg Rudolph is a TF next year and you get into his section, switch). Their exam help rooms were an unhelpful mess and help rooms NEED to be improved. Overall this course was just okay--better than last year, but not by much.Definitely don't take as an elective, but since it is required for pre-meds and science concentrators, you are sort of stuck taking it at some point.","Go to problem solving lectures. Make a collaborative study guide.","LS1b is well aware of the fact that it needs to improve, and the teaching staff are obviously working quite hard to do so.  That said, the class is still more a scattered series of data for students to learn and fails to engage critical problem-solving abilities in a meaningful way.","Only take LS1b if you have to.  It will be frustrating, and you will regret the time you spend on this class.","This isn't a class you take if you aren't a science concentrator or premed. It is a lot of work and it isn't easy, but this year the improvements really seemed to pay off. The lectures were generally very good. Section was usually good because that's where you learn how to do the problems that will be on psets and tests. Overall, it wasn't very painful.","Prepare for exams all along; do not wait until several days beforehand to attempt to learn all the information. You need a larger grasp of the concepts, which comes only with gradual learning over time.","It's necessary for later science classes and the topics are interesting but not the most exciting of classes.","I assume it's better than before. Exams were half concepts half problems. They like to introduce new kinds of problems(not like practice probs or section probs)on the exam. BE PREPARED FOR THAT! The Friday reviews are really just MANDATORY. They're basically the only way to learn how to do some of the pset problems(unless your TF is awesome and teaches this)","You have to take it because it is required, but it is awful. Just please don't make your decision about being a doctor on lifesci 1a and 1b because these courses are just bad, and it's not your fault.","Take the course if the professors are Andrew Berry, Hopi, and Maryellen. Labs and sections are a pain, but just get through it. Lectures with these professors make up for it.","Berry and Hoekstra are both great lecturers, but Ruvolo is an unsatisfactory lecturer. Her presentations were 90 slides long for a class that is less than an hour and a half long meaning that she devoted less than a minute to each slide, her explanations were often more confusing than helpful, and I had trouble seeing how the topics she taught related to each other. I was satisfied with the course, until we reached the segment she had to teach.","Interesting course, you will learn a fair amount. Not too much work.  However, topics are presented in a somewhat disorienting order, and labs are pretty ineffective.","Be organized, and have a general sense of direction for yourself","don't assume it is exactly like LS1a","Feel free to skip this class!  The upper-level genetics classes are completely accessible without it, and your time will be better spent elsewhere.  You can pick up all of the useful parts of this class from context at higher levels, no problem.","I waited a year to see if LS1b would be \"fixed\" after its unfortunate reputation in past years, and I would say that it definitely has been.  All 3 lecturers were outstanding, and the course covered a vast amount of material while maintaining a very manageable workload. Don't let the midterms catch you off guard though, or it can be painful.  Work hard, do practice problems, and you won't regret taking this class.","LS1b is an everything bio class.  If you want to be a life sciences concentrator you pretty much have to take it, so just suck it up and accept that it'a a bit difficult.  The professors are interesting (Andrew and Hopi do an excellent job) and know what they're talking about.  The material is very interesting, but there's just a lot of it.","Put in the work and make sure you do the side readings. They're really helpful.","Be prepared","This class should be taken if one knows that they might concentrate in science or like the material.","I think this course is decent, considering its new reform. With time, I believe the lecturers will learn to give a more clear presentation of material and write less frustratingly vague problem sets and exams. Their intentions are good, but the quality of this course has been rather lackluster at best. If you must take it, you must - and it won't be exceptionally difficult - but it might be a bit confusing.","You're taking it because you're pre-med and you have to. Enjoy it, the professors are great and wonderful people, but the lectures seemed nearly pointless at times because I always wondered how we'd be tested on that and it was never how I expected.","A lot of people write \"only take this class if it's required.\" LS1b defines that sentiment. It is a decent introduction with no glaring weaknesses, but is also a testament to the fact that lectures don't matter THAT much if the section materials, exams, and other assignments are mostly the same. This class got awful Q guides last year, they improved the lecturers (a bit), and the class is...better, but not GOOD. There's still a fair bit of wasted time, a few notable moments of disjointedness, and overall not very stimulating subject matter.\r\n\r\nStill, it was decent, which is not something many people would've said last year.\r\n\r\nPS: The final is hard - study the monkey terms from the end a lot!","I would have chosen 'unlikely to recommend' if it weren't for the fact that Ls1b  is the gateway class to practically all other pre-med rec science classes.","If I didn't have to take this class, I wouldn't have. The professors have drastically improved, I'm sure, yet the class is still awful at times. Be prepared to enjoy watching Andrew Berry's lectures, but then be confused as to what you actually learned in them afterwards. Be prepared to love Hopi Hoekstra's lectures because she actually explains things clearly and gives you the main idea of each slide in a red box, which really helps. Be prepared to like Dr. Ruvolo's lectures on Tuesdays and then fall asleep during dense lectures on Thursdays. Be prepared to have a terrible TF that wastes your time in section every week for three hours. Be prepared to not have enough time to finish your first midterm. Be prepared to get no partial credit on the second midterm (although this midterm wasn't bad at all, people who missed a question, missed it completely). Lastly, be prepared to be take an extremely unfair final, which will ask you questions about videos that weren't even shown in class and ask you to recreate experiments from the one lecture that literally caused half the class to go to sleep and the other half to look dazed and confused. Be prepared to take notes, so that you can destroy them in the q guide next year, unless a miracle happens and they actually listen to the advice that students give regarding the course. All in all, the topics are actually interesting, yet they make the class very annoying and a pain to be in. The professors could  do something phenomenal if they worked with the equally great preceptors to  create something that is enjoyable for students. But until then, be prepared to loathe this class.","Not bad, but only take it if you need it for credit or if you are genuinely interested in genetics. Also, beware of really long exams and having to learn a lot of material.","It's a pill. If you must take it, swallow it, don't complain, and don't brag about how many hours you've spent locked in your room studying for the midterm. \r\nBe careful - it is NOT well organized... the course heads\/head TFs\/lab TFs all seem to be on different pages in terms of what is required\/how to do genetics\/what the heck is going on.","The course is challenging, but not a huge struggle or time suck. As a humanities concentrator that isn't super science-oriented, I found that the material was pretty easy to understand and grasp, and  interesting as well.","The class butchers what ought to be interesting material. Enjoy the lectures and read through the textbook, but endure lab sections and just get through the course. It's not hard.","sucks!","LS1b is not a bad class- you learn a lot, and all 3 instructors were very engaging, funny, and overall good lecturers.  A lot of material is covered, so go to office hours and start studying in advance. Really understand the concepts behind experiments and problems, not just the answer. The exams were long and required working quickly.","All of the professors, not just Andrew Berry, are awesome. But, the psets and exams are pretty challenging. Definitely make sure you have a good study group. The material is interesting, but frustrating to learn sometimes because you are so focused on specific types of questions that sometimes you miss the big picture.","Although the lecturers are pretty good (much better than previous years), the course itself is lacking. Perhaps it's just hard to make an introductory genetics class exciting.","Take this class if you want to learn how to deal with classes on your own.  I didn't understand what was going on and didn't go to lecture, but I did above the mean on all the exams just by doing all the problem sets, practice problem sets, and practice midterms and researching everything on my own. The way this class is disorganized, you end up doing the same thing whether or not you go to lecture.","This is genuinely the worst course I have ever enrolled in throughout the entirety of my academic career.  Even if this course is a concentration requirement, DO NOT take it until it gets better Q scores or there are serious course overhauls.  This course has made me reevaluate my status as a science concentrator despite having a long history in science research.","If you're in the sciences, you've got to take it. And it is certainly WAY better than last year, from what I've heard. But I've never been good at these hard science classes, so focused on methods and memorization. If you've got a solid work ethic you'll be fine; if not, good luck...","Not a fun course but you gotta do it if you want that MD eventually. This year was much better than years past and it really wasn't that hard during the year (psets are super easy). Exams however (especially the final) got fairly nit-picky in expecting you to memorize small (and annoying) details.","Beware of exams. They can be ridiculous. The course content is interesting , just make sure to keep up with the lectures and do practice problems!","A course with really interesting material but really hard exams.","very difficult","very unorganized course","This was a great course overall. The class size was definitely too large though.","LS1b has become an amazing class especially with Dr. Berry lecturing. The problem sets help you work through the material covered in lecture and if you're comfortable with them, you'll be fine on the midterm (usually).","It's hard, but the lectures are great","Not as bad as its reputation!","The material seems straightforward but the tests are very, very difficult if you do not truly understand the material well enough to APPLY the concepts. Practice questions only helped so much. The new instructors make lecture interesting and enjoyable, but be sure to glean the important points from the lectures.","the professors and material is great, though the problems and tests, as always, can be very challenging.","Hopefully the course will be better organized next year, but the lectures were very interesting for the most part. As a warning, a LOT of material is covered throughout the semester","While this course is a pre-req for a lot, be wary because it is very poorly organized and may require more time than you expect (you end up compensating for poor lectures and teaching yourself a lot of the material). The problem solving lectures that Casey held on Fridays were by far the most helpful aspect of the course (critical for many of the psets and very useful for midterm preparation). Overall, the exams were unexpected and did not seem related to a lot of what had been emphasized in lecture, problem solving and section.","LS1b is an experience you likely have to have for your life sciences concentration or to satisfy pre-med requirements. It's not that bad and occasionally fun, but I wouldn't recommend it as an elective.","It is a lot of information. Doing practice problems is much more useful than reading.","Though they made lots of changes, I would say this class still needs considerable improvement. The lectures are often interesting, and can even be entertaining, but those who run the course really need to do a better job of making clear what we need to do and what we need to know. It was so frustrating that all I had to go off of to study for a test was a list of a few hundred words, most of which were just casually mentioned during lecture. Needless to say, the exams usually threw a few curveballs at you. They made us buy a textbook, but it was always unclear as to whether we were supposed to read it or use it. I loved my TF, but many of the labs were painfully long. In the end, only take this class if you absolutely have to (for pre-med or concentration) because it will continue to frustrate you throughout the semester.","This course is basically and introduction to OEB and HEB. If you're interested in those fields, then there's a good chance you'll really enjoy LS1b. The tests are pretty fair. The reading is unnecessary, since the lectures are sufficient. Don't let the ethos around the class ruin it. The lecturers are pretty good.","this class requires you to do the work but its manageable.","Dr. Berry is awesome. Make sure you take a class from him before you graduate and go to his office hours! This class was super interesting if you like DNA at all. It is a good overview of evolutionary biology and human origins.","Avoid this class. It is not worth the trouble. The problem sets are not difficult but the lectures are not even worth going to.","It's not that great, but you have to take it. On the plus side Andrew Berry is hilarious.","It was extremely difficult and hard to learn the material.","The material is interesting, but it takes a lot of work to do well.","This class is one of the most poorly run classes ever.  Go to friday lectures which are the only things tested on.  Lecture is a waste since they don't cover the material necessary for the exams.  But it doesn't matter because you have to take LS1b anyway...","Take it because you have to. It's not great at all. Just get through it and work with friends to understand the material.","it's not terrible. do not procrastinate studying and study all of the random\/vague notes. know the concepts--don't just do practice problems. compared to other years it's apparently better. berry and hoekstra are amazing. ruvolo is boring and turned me off of HEB forever. what you learn is pretty interesting, but the statistics part (heritability, etc.) seemed really pointless and was incredibly boring.","This class became enjoyable as time passed (which may be unheard of in the history of LS1B).","you probably don't have much of a choice and have to take ls1b, but I found the course material to be very interesting and based on talking with previous students, the lectures are now much more engaging.  don't worry, it's not as bad as many people make it out to be and I enjoyed it!","It's better than it was based on what I have heard from other former students. However, I found it really hard to figure out just what I was trying to take out of the material. Often I felt like a lot of information was being thrown at me without a cohesive picture.","Only take this course if you need it for pre-med or for concentration, so try to figure out if you want to do the life sciences or pre-med before 2nd semester, or wait until you're sure. The class is definitely taught better than it has been in the past, but it was still my least favorite class, because I felt like I couldn't pick out the important parts of lecture. The symposium was really cool and interesting, especially for someone not into the research side because it gave a face to the disease we studied.","This class is not the most straightforward. I would suggest reading lecture and doing ALL the practice problems, and attending the problem review sessions. These give a better sense of the type of questions on the exams than the book, or the problem sets. Do these problems more than once if you have to.","It is much better than it used to be!  The lecturers are very interesting (especially Andrew Berry he is awesome, such a legend)!!!! Section leaders are all very strong in their element and the amount of practice problems available is great.  Do them! And take the practice exams! Take what they give you.","This class is slightly boring at times and difficult with tests, but pretty rewarding once completed.","If you are interested in the material, then the class will be useful. The topics are interesting and important, even though they are difficult. But more importantly something to keep in mind is that the class itself needs a lot of changes. There are many things that do not correlate, and some of the lecturers were more effective than others.","I'm sure this was better than it was in years past, but still not a great class. The lectures are kind of all over the place and seem unconnected.","It is a lot of work. Based on what i have heard in the past this course has improved A LOT. I really enjoyed it, but it is a lot of memorization and application. One should go in with the mindset that they will be putting in quite a few hours.","It's LS1b.  Professor Berry, Hoekstra, and Ruvolo are fantastic and entertaining lecturers, but the material is covered too quickly and the psets do not reflect the difficulty of the exams.  Personally, the most challenging part of the course was my lack of background in the material.","If you're planning on taking this course it is most likely because you are very interested in the life sciences, so you will most likely find the course material super interesting. The teaching could be better.","Take it only if you have to (pre-med\/concentration requirement).","Difficult class, but the recently restructured format of it is apparently much better than what it was before - makes me glad I took it this year! Hopi was the best lecturer!","LS1B has been one of the more interesting lifesci courses I've taken at Harvard. Very well taught, the professors are great and generate great enthusiasm for the course. Do the practice problems! go to the problem solving lectures, and PSLs, they are helpful in getting through the material and p-sets. Take advantage of all the resources that are available for this course and you should be fine.","I can only see this class getting better as Dr. Berry and Hoekstra get more familiar with the course. Most people will be taking this because it's a requirement but if you have a good TF, you'll have a good time.","Professor Barry's lecture slides are kind of useless and Mary Ellen was pretty boring to listen to. Although all the professors generate enthusiasm for the course, it is impossible to do the problem sets without going to the Friday help sessions. These help session should not be optional!!! They are absolutely necessary to just have a basic idea of what is going on in the course. Also, the readings are not that helpful. To prepare for exams, you really need to do all the practice problems.","Pretty good course, but watch out for ruvolo, she is TERRIBLE.","Only take it if you have to. The lecturers are great, but the course is unfocused and poorly planned. Ignore what they teach in lectures and pay attention in section.","Run. Run far away. Then come back and enroll. The bottom line here is, this class is mandatory. You have to take it, even as much as you don't want to.","Take it because you need to. Some parts can be enjoyable but do not expect it to be outstanding in all regards.","Much better than past years, lecturers work hard to make it interesting and most of the mateiral is cool. Some of the applications though are weird, more like tricky mental exercises to mess with harvard freshmen than real problems to work through, so watch out on the MTs and final.","Study.  Go to office hours.  The professors are cool to talk to and you don't even have to talk about the course.","Only take this course if you need to fulfill a requirement.  It is a very frustrating course, due to poor organization, problem sets and exams.","The completely REVAMPED version of LS1B is really great. Truly an interesting class. While all the assessments are very difficult, it is a very doable class. The work load isn't too killer and the information is really interesting. Berry, Hoekstra, Ruvolo combo is incredible. They are usually really great lecturers and keep students engaged. Don't buy the textbook. It makes everything way more confusing than it needs to be, in my opinion. Waste of $140.","LS1b is a solid course for anyone looking to satisfy part of the pre-med biology requirement or just an interest in genetics in general. Although I took the course for the former reason (I have no unusually intense passion for genetics over any other science), I can still attest that it is an informative and well-run course.","Although the material is interesting, the course is poorly organized.","If you're considering LS1b, I think the important thing to realize is that the material is really really interesting, and some of it (mainly Andrew Berry's) will be taught extremely clearly and well. Some of it will be much harder to get in lecture, and you'll have to put in extra work in section and outside of class to do well. That said, as someone who's interested in genetics, I really enjoyed taking this class and loved learning the new concepts. (And labs are really fun!)\r\nAdvice if you end up taking LS1b -- the problem sets aren't very hard, but it's worth it to spend some extra time every week reviewing because exams are more difficult.","There's no way of telling what's going to be on the exam, so study everything, and expect to be disappointed.","You have to take it. Try your best and trust me everyone else hates it just as much as you do.","Did not like the LS series overall, however this class is very well organized. Even though the subject matter was not really cohesive you do come out of it getting a big sense of the world of genetics. If I could I would have chosen to taken LS2 or the MCB series over it.","If you're reading this, you probably have no choice but to take LS1b. But still, at least be aware of what you should appreciate about this class:\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n\r\n1. The professors. From what I heard, previous years were utter disasters. I am grateful to have had passionate, interesting, and caring professors this year. Andrew Berry is very politically incorrect at times, incoherent often, but altogether caring and exciting to watch. Ruvulo is REALLY hard to understand and follow but a leader in her field. The way she shaped her lectures and the course has some merit. I know she has her own reasons for why and it's probably in our best interests. Hopi is the best. Appreciate her lectures for being the most coherent. They have stories with them too and are extremely fun.\r\n\r\n2. The questions on the exams and problem sets that we had never seen before. The most learning happens when memorization is not enough. It is when we are given a situation that we have never before seen and are asked to think critically and carefully about the available possibilites before justifying them with our own reasoning.\r\n\r\n3. The labs were very well-organized and interesting (ESPECIALLY THE DNA SEQUENCING. Being able to see your OWN DNA is literally the coolest thing. You get to see where YOU individually came from in the lineage of chimps, gorillas, and Neanderthals. It's awesome.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best moments of the course are when they emphasize critical thinking. Admittedly, there were at times when there was too much memorization (i.e. memorizing the phylogeny of human ancestry). We are all going to forget the names of say, the strepsirhines and haplorhines, in about two weeks. Is that learning? No. What is learning is when we get a question about how QTL works and are asked to reason through how we would actually create the crosses. The question was challenging and required NOT ONLY a thorough understanding of QTL analysis but careful analysis, thought, and extrapolation. It is these skills that we carry on throughout our undergraduate careers and on. I feel this is what makes our professors famous in their fields. I feel this is quality learning. Savor and appreciate this.\r\n\r\nAlso, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read the book. The assigned readings are impossible to complete. If they still use it next year, just glance through the chapters before going into lecture so that you recognize and understand key terms, summaries, and diagrams. That will help you from staying too focused on writing down the slide info and more focused on actually understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINALLY: People will complain regardless abut LS1b. Ultimately, remember the quality of the course is also dependent on you. If you want it to be world-class, take the initiative. Review lecture slides after lecture. Go in to office hours. Find Andrew Berry. Listen to him talk in his British accent. Solve problem sets independently if you can until you genuinely can't solve a problem. ONLY THEN should you seek collaborative help. Don't try to just copy answers. Enjoy and appreciate the exams. They can get really hard. The final was 24 pages. Crazy right? But it's a fun challenge. Savor it. Grab your education with your own hands. Don't be passive.","Take this course since it is interesting but be prepared to work.","This class can have a lot of tedious, boring moments, but it also has sparks of really interesting material as well. This would be a good class to explore if you are thinking about the different evolutionary concentrations because all forms of evolution, from fossils, humans, plants, etc, are covered in at least some detail throughout the course.","It's a good class but be prepared to put a lot of hours into class\/section\/work outside of class. this is not a small commitment.","Don't need to know LS1a super well to do well in the couse. Very manageable if you stay up to date on the material and understand the psets. Very interesting as well!!","Just don't take this class if you don't have to. You'll seriously be miserable.","I would only take this class if you have to.  It seems like it is doomed to be one of the most disorganized and unsuccessful classes that Harvard offers.","This was actually the most poorly organized and taught class I have ever experienced. The subject material is extremely interesting and not that hard but they somehow manage to make this class way more work and trouble than it should be.","It's a lot of work but if you already like bio you'll find it really interesting.","This is a fine class--not great but the teaching staff genuinely does their best to have students enjoy a huge pre-med lecture.  Go to problem solving lectures on Friday.","definitely only if required","This class is difficult, so students should be sure to stay on top of all material taught in class and not let themselves fall behind. Also, the practice problems are a very important, helpful study tool for exams. I would strongly recommend that students use these and go to problem sessions as well.","Class has improved considerably!","It's difficult to avoid this class for science concentrators, so you just have to get it over with. It wasn't a ton of work, but some of the lectures were really boring, some of the labs were pointless, and some of the psets are extremely difficult for no real reason.","you probably only take it if you have to, but the material is actually quite interesting and applicable to life, and the probsolving lectures on fridays are incredibly useful (i would recommend always going if you're at all unsure of the material).","The content was pretty cool, and you'll appreciate the content a lot more if you do the readings and work a bit to understand all of it, but the course itself was a little unorganized and not very well run.","Don't take it unless you're pre-med.","This class still needs work. Good teachers though.","Don't do the assigned readings in the textbook. They are completely unnecessary. Do do all the review materials available on the course website.","Take the class very seriously, STUDY, STUDY, and STUDY some more.","This class can be very entertaining, but the material is not always presented succinctly or logically.  A good TF is key","You have to take this class if you're thinking about doing the life sciences, so there's not much wiggle room, and Dr. Berry, Dr. Hoekstra, and Dr. Ruvolo do try to make the whole class as painless as possible. With that being said, the class will be a bit of a nuisance at times. The grading is extremely inconsistent from TF to TF, and though you may feel like you did well on an exam, the preceptors will knock you points for neglecting even the most minute of details. The lectures as a whole are pretty enjoyable (except for the last several), and the section component is a great supplement to the lectures in helping you understand the problem solving portion of the class.","This is literally the worst class I've ever taken in my entire life, not just at Harvard. There is honestly no way to learn the material that is on the exams since it is not taught in lecture or section. I really think this class is some sort of sick joke. If you must take this class for a premed requirement, beware it will probably ruin your GPA for med school and maybe even persuade you to pursue another field. The professors are ruthless and don't care if everyone fails. The exams are literally marathons, no one finishes in time and I think this is very well reflected in the fact that the mean for the first midterm was a 70. The fact that everyone fails the class is a reflection of the inane teaching of this class and not of the students, but the professors don't seem to understand this. I honestly think the goal of this class is to crush as many premed students' aspirations as possible. Harvard should be embarrassed for offering such an ill-taught impossible class. I recommend this class to no one. Find another way to get the premed requirement as this is one of the the worst classes offered at Harvard.","It takes work\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot hard per say, but the details can get annoying if you aren't particularly enthused.","The p sets are fun, but the tests are annoying.... Be prepared to answer questions about nitty gritty details","Way better now with the new teaching staff. Andrew Berry is boss, Hopi is awesome, and Maryellen is great too. Cool material if you're interested in genetics, etc., and somewhat useful too. I had fun overall.","This course was difficult, but fun. Or so I am told.","You probably are taking this course because you have to. It's not that bad, as the lectures are okay, albeit they can be boring. Section is painfully long, but some of the labs are interesting. The problem sets take a while, and the first midterm exam was ridiculously long and was not curved to make up for it, but this is probably not a mistake they will make again. It wasn't my favorite class, but it was tolerable, and more importantly, required.","it's a good class. make sure you attend Andrew and Hopi's lectures. make sure to skip Maryellen's lecture because they're useless. section can be helpful. labs are not always fun but they are engaging in general. readings are useless and no one does them. make sure you do the practice problems!","It's intro to genetics -- don't expect it to get all that exciting. That said, much of the material covered is very interesting.","Pretty good course for a large introductory level class. Be sure to go to the PSL sessions. They are really helpful. It's great to check your work with others and get guidance from people have been in the class before. Be prepared to see some tiny minuscule details on the midterm\/final. Pay attention in lecture\/ watch lecture's online.","Unfortunately, most people have to take this class. Be forewarned, its not fun. My best advice is to go to Casey's problem solving lectures on fridays. that is the only way to get psets and practice problems done because they don't teach you any of it during lecture.\r\n\r\nThe material itself is interesting, but they really need to fix this class. still has its kinks and it added a lot more stress on me.\r\n\r\nI liked expos more than ls1b.....that says something.","You have to take it, so suck it up. Even with the teaching staff, LS1B is an organizational disaster. Just get through, at least you'll be done with it in a semester.","If you space it out, it is easy to stay on top of the work and learn\/understand everything.  The teachers are fun, and will keep you interested.","Avoid if possible (horrible way to \"explore\" an interest)","Be prepared to navigate a lot of material and a lot of expectations of you as a student. There's also great competition to get help from the teaching staff because of the sheer number of students in the course. If you want individual attention, be proactive and start getting to know the teaching  staff early.","This class is difficult. Make this class your focus for the semester you take it, spending most of your study time on it.","its not as bad as it used to be.  theyve done a good job fixing it","This was a really interesting class with instructors who really care. It still feels a bit like a basic science intro class, but has things (like lab quizzes) that make you more likely to keep up with required work. :)","They throw a ridiculous amount of information at you in this course.  The focus is not on problem solving like ls1a, but rote memorization.  Unless you have an eidetic memory, you will have trouble with the exams.  Glad it's over...","Hope you have a good TF, because TFs make or beak this course.","The subject matter is interesting but it is presented in a disorganized way","The College has done a tremendous job at improving this course. The lecturers are fantastic and the course is set up in such a way to aid the students taking it, with copious additional aid for those needing it. I would take this class even if you aren't in the sciences. The materials discussed are rather interesting and discovering just how far research has come in the last 30 years is astounding. Plus you get the humorous banter between Professor Hoekstra and Professor Berry.","I took this as an 'elective.' That might have been a mistake.","Lectures were very interesting but exams could be difficult.","Make sure to study regularly, do the practice problems, and ask for help when needed.","This class requires a lot of reading and thorough understanding.","Grading for tests are heavily based on explaining definitions. Furthermore, these definitions are graded on a rubric, resulting in a grade that might not necessarily reflect your understanding.","The lectures do not really coincide with the problem sets or the exams. Also, the questions on the midterms\/exams are incredibly unclear and ambiguous. It was a struggle.","it's a rough class, but manageable and the section\/lab really helps","Take this course if you need it for a requirement... It's not terribly difficult but can be annoying at times.","If you are more interested in molecular biology, you will probably not particularly enjoy this class, though the material can be pretty interesting. Regardless, I feel like this semester at least, the class was not particularly well organized, which made the psets sometimes a bit random and made it harder to study for the exams.","I personally liked this course better than LS1a. It's true that the problems sets are vague and frustrating sometimes, but the lectures are often very engaging purely because the information in them is really cool. All 3 of the professors (Berry, Ruvolo, and Hoekstra) are good lecturers.","The exams are extremely difficult.","It's a wonderful introductory course. The material is manageable, lecture is relaxing and enjoyable, and section provides every tool you need to complete psets with ease. There are no unpleasant surprises. And you cannot go wrong with the spectacular and fabulous Andrew Berry! However, nothing is not gone over in too much depth, and little mathematics rigor is involved despite numerous application opportunities (alarmingly some elementary math is deemed to suffice as \"statistical analysis\"), which may not satisfy those seeking something more substantial. But it does give you a good sample of the spectrum of the biological field. And, as memorization rather than problem-solving seems to be the more useful skill in this case, this course is friendly as a Ged-Ed.","Horrible but necessary class","Only take this class if you are premed or have to take it. Not fun or enjoyable.","Very interesting material but terrible TF."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you're considering the class at all, you probably have to take it for a biology concentration or premed requirement, so you'll have to just grin and bear it. It will be manageable, but very frustrating along the way. Be prepared to seek out information independently from TFs and PSLs, because there is a large disconnect between what is emphasized in lecture and what will show up on p-sets and exams.","This class is very difficult, but I found it to be well-run.  I definitely feel that it does not deserve the horrible reputation that is has.  The subject material was really interesting, the professors were interesting, and the assignments were fair.","Do not take this class unless you need to.","It is interesting in some regards, but if you do not need the requirement, I would recommend another biology-based course.","It's not bad, it's just hard!","I came into this class expecting it to terrible based on past years, but it was truly worlds apart from what it used to be.  I LOVED it and highly, highly recommend it.  There is a lot of material for sure, but it's all interesting if biology and genetics are your thing.  The GDP sounds annoying at first, but if you put effort into it, it's a lot of fun to learn about the disorder and a great opportunity to apply what you learn in lecture.","The exams are graded really hard.","The subject is not that bad, but the teaching did not seem to match with the tests. The lectures and sections were okay but were not that relevant.","Very large class and it'll be hard to get help from the teachers of this course. Sometimes, the teachers also have conflicting answers. The material is interesting though not always presented in a clear manner. The psets will actually help with learning while the lectures are not very helpful with problems. The Friday problem solving lectures are the best in terms of help for problem sets. Don't miss them! Choose your section wisely. If the TF is not clear, then your understanding of the material will be hazy and you'll have to make up for that later or take the consequences in an exam.","You'll have to spend some time by yourself truly internalizing and understanding the material before you know how to do psets and some of the other assignments.  The GDP is cool and interesting, but is a hassle and unnecessarily drawn out.  Section is definitely more helpful than lecture, though the labs feel incredibly repetitive.  It'll take lots of time and may not feel rewarding, but you'll definitely learn a lot.","Although the material is not hard and actually interesting LS1b is poorly taught in lecture and you're expected to learn everything outside of class. You never know what to expect on the exam because the lectures are full of unnecessary details and the lecturers don't make it clear what will be asked.\r\n\r\nalso: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE THIS FOR PRE-MED. Talk to advisors and make sure you can take higher bio for your bio requirement: It will not be a  harder experience than Ls1b","First of all, they cover way too much material in the course. There's four professors who teach the course and each feels that it's of utmost importance to cover their own material in great depth. As a result, they attempt to cram in a lot of material without actually teaching it to you or giving it a lot of time to sink in. At one point, we were literally covering over 200 slides in each 90 minute lecture.\r\n\r\nThe course is not very well organized. To do well in this course, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time learning (memorizing) the material on your own. Friday problem sessions are an absolute requirement if you want to have any idea how to do psets. Even then, psets go over a lot of material barely covered in lecture, so you'll have to go to office hours or find student study groups. There are many TFs for this course and quality control seems to be lacking so a lot of them won't really be able to help you with learning material very well. Instead, directly email professors and go to their office hours incessantly.\r\n\r\nSection and labs are annoying. They keep you in labs for 3 hours every week, sometimes longer. During this, you will have labs with a lot of sitting around and a review of problems. If you have a TF who doesn't know his\/her material, this time will be incredibly painful and prolonged.\r\n\r\nThey will tell you that you have to take this course. This is a lie. You have to get credit for this course for most science requirements--and you can do that by testing out of it at the beginning of the semester. Wish I knew about that before taking this course. Seriously, study on your own and keep trying to test out until you can to avoid the mess that Ls1b is every single year.","If you get a good TF then I think your experience will be compltetly different than mine. Also, go to problem solving lectures. They may seem annoying becuase they are an extra lecture but they basically tell you how to do pset problems and are extremely useful when the time to study for the exam comes. The class itself hardly covers how to do problems that are on psets and exams.","Pay attention in section and go to office hours. That's the only way to really do well in the course.","Genetics is a fascinating field, and it is fairly well taught in this course.","Material is awesome, class is pretty disorganized but if you can get past that and just enjoy the learning it's great.","Interesting class, a lot of work and material covered","This class was wonderful. The material is fascinating and well-taught and the problem sets and labs are relevant.","Lectures and professors are terrific: so practical and knowledgeable and fun and helpful. The head TFs make a huge effort to help. So many great resources to succeed and have a blast doing it if you put in the time and take advantage of them!","The material can be really interesting! Make sure to attend problem-solving lectures and pay attention in section so that you know the concepts to concentrate on since there is a lot of material!","God, I wish there were an alternative to this pre-med-weeding class.","Decent class. The professors all try to make it good, and it has improved from previous years. However, our final counted for up to 55% of our grade, while made that 3-hour period extremely important.","LS1b has definitely improved from previous iterations, but I still would not take this class if other options are available.","People made this class out to be the worst and super hard. But luckily, they did a massive rehaul, so the course is taught by knowledgeable professors. The tests are hard, but hey if you're premed, at least it's good practice for Orgo.","This course is a great course in terms of the material taught; however, the problem sets and test questions are often phrased in tricky ways. Watch out for that, and otherwise the professors, especially Dr. Ruvolo and Dr. Hoekstra are amazing!","Awesome topic,  great professors for the most part","There is a lot of review material interspersed with new material in the lectures, so it is easy to miss out on new content if you lose focus while listening to what you think is review. Practice the problems; they help in cementing what is important to remember.","Unfortunately, LS1b is a requirement for pre-med and for many life sciences concentrations.  So I can't tell you not to take it, but I can tell you to be prepared for a lot of frustration.  The course is very disorganized and, while I like the subject matter, the structure (or lack thereof) really detracted for me.  Also, pset grading (at least from my TF) wasn't super fair.  Exam questions are sometimes incredibly random and specific.  Meh.","I'd heard bad things about LS1b coming in, but I really enjoyed my time in the course.  While the course starts out very slowly, the material is very interesting and well organized.  Hopi and Maryellen are great lecturers, and Kevin and Pardis are great too but I think their material was less interesting. The GDP project was incredible as it showed me that what we were learning in class was actually being used in the real world. I found myself understanding articles for other science classes better because of the terminology we had learned in class.  I highly recommend taking this class, not only because it fulfills a lot of requirements, but also because you'll get a lot out of it without an unmanageable amount of work.","Difficult but you learn a lot","If you see this comment, there are two possibilities:\r\n1. You are required to take this class.\r\n2. You are interested in genetics\/HEB and want this as an elective\/GenEd, etc.\r\nFor 1:\r\nWell I guess you have to take this class? Here's the thing:\r\na. Do the psets carefully. \r\nb. Learn all the lecture slides\/videos right after class. Don't do this the night before exam.\r\nc. Write as much as you can in midterms even if that is redundant.\r\nd. You have to show up in lectures... they have clicker questions. BUT SERIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO KEEP STUDENTS BY DOING CLICKER QUESTIONS IS JUST LIKE A STUPID WOMAN ATTEMPTING TO KEEP A MAN WITH PREGNANCY!\r\ne. Section TF's vary so much... I had to attend someone else's office hours before an exam, and that guy sucks... he didn't even know what the pset looks like! Sectioning is not completely random. You can request a specific TF if you know someone, and you can send an email to the preceptor. I sectioned with Eugene Gladyshev (who is also my LS1a TF and is super cool).\r\nf. Memorize the names of all those (dead) monkeys...\r\ng. If you have known a lot about evolution and genetics, try to place out of this class. There is a special placement test at the beginning of the term. Inquire is there is no announcement. \r\nFor 2:\r\nYou are not required to take this class? Dude then go find another class.","This has been my favorite course so far. The professors are wonderful, the lectures engaging, the material fascinating and relevant. The workload is definitely manageable. I would recommend this to anyone even considering a biology concentration. GREAT COURSE!","-It's been fixed!","This course has issues, but I'd still recommend it. The readings are not necessary (except when a pset question occasionally comes straight from the reading), but can help clarify material. I know some people thought the psets asked random questions from nowhere, but I didn't get that feeling at all. I was one of those people hating on GDP and totally skeptical when the teaching staff introduced it saying that most people ended up thinking it was the best part of the course. It may not have been the best part of the course, but the symposium more than made up for the annoying parts. The course is not organized super well right now. The math is all pushed into one prof's lectures, even if it'd make sense somewhere else. It would have been much better if the math had been integrated throughout as necessitated by the material, even if it meant two profs splitting a lecture. Finally, the problem solving lectures are uber great. Use the slides and\/or watch them online (I think I went to 1.5 in real time). They are not necessary for psets, but they're pretty darn helpful.","This is a class plagued with problems. Whatever reason you may have to take this class. Don't. I'm a  junior and this was by far the worst class that I have taken at Harvard. PSets have terrible grading schemes to them, exams are not representative of the course, lectures are poorly given, and (mandatory) section is the biggest waste of time. Test out of it, take other classes, do whatever you have to do. Don't take LS1b.","I went into LS1b pretty hesitant, but left fairly satisfied.  Q scores from past years were pretty dreadful, and I heard mostly bad things, but I thought it was a pretty decent course overall.  I think they did a great job revamping the course.  It is still a huge lecture class with 500 students, so don't expect personal attention unless you frequent office hours, but the support system and coursework are pretty solid, and I'm sure they'll continue to steadily improve when you take the course.  Keep yourself reviewed on concepts, and go to review, and you really shouldn't find LS1b as demoralizing as it's made out to be.","be prepared to work a lot. and go to problem solving lectures","The class material is super interesting and you will learn a lot about genetics and its critical role and importance for the future of biology. The GDP project is an especially awesome and salient way to see how the course concepts relate to life and society. However, the course is tough and will require a considerable amount of time and work. Unfortunately, the biggest issue with the course is that you still may not do well even when you put in this time\/effort because the exams don't necessarily test you on the most important concepts and they punish you unnecessarily for small details. I would say the best way to ensure success in the course is to seek out the wide variety of resources they make available to you (PSL's, TF's, professors, etc.).","If you have to take this class, I am sorry. It has so much potential, the material is fascinating. They just try to fit in too much information into lecture, then different information in section, with confusing p-sets. Not all of the professor are comprehensible, and some of the lecture teaching-methods are very questionable (mostly confusing). I loved the material, hated the class","LS1b was really one of my favorite courses this semester. Dr. Eggan is super cool, spent hours at home filming videos of mitosis\/meiosis demos, threw us a party\/movie screening on his birthday, and, of course, is really hot. Dr. Hoekstra is adorable and sweet, answers questions outside of class and publishes them as super-helpful Q&A's in her lecture notes, and has really great office hours (like every teacher in this class). Dr. Sabeti is also super cool, made sure to bring oranges to throw at people for every question answered, and somehow made odds ratios and LOD scores make sense (with the help of Casey's problem solving sessions - on that note, those sessions are so helpful and any student should try their best to make every one. She throws chocolate too!). It was her first time teaching the class, so her part should be even better next year. Dr. Ruvolo is also great, and she is very dedicated to improving the class.","Only take this course if required","It has its ups and downs, but considering anyone enrolled is probably only there because they have to be, it could be worse. Most of the lectures are more interesting than LS1a, but the section\/lab component is much worse.","If you're pre-med or a Life Sciences concentrator, chances are you have to take this course regardless of Q scores. That being said, I personally preferred this course to LS1a and found it genuinely interesting and engaging. The lecturers do a fantastic job, and most of the labs performed in section are really interesting as well.","I definitely expected it to be a lot worse than it actually was. This course was very interesting and I recommend it. However, it can be a lot of work as there are lab quizzes, problem sets, the GDP project, and studying for tests. It can be done but just be aware of the time commitment.","If you take it, you're either pre-med or psycho.  Don't take this class unless you're a masochist.  Or a pre-med.  Same thing, really.","I think that its easy info, but their grading is just harsh and outside graders are annoying. The information is really interesting, though.","Take this class! It's awesome, regardless of the somewhat tough exams.","This class is definitely much better than the reputation it has. It's not nearly as hard or time consuming as LS1a, the material is actually interesting, and the labs I thought were great. I don't know if you should take it if you don't have to since you will learn a lot of technical stuff that is probably not that interesting, but if you do have to I would say it's not a bad class at all.","This class really isn't as bad as everybody says. Just do your work and keep up with the lecture material. The psets are straightforward and the tests doable. Take this class if you're interested in genetics or thinking about being a bio concentrator.","First of all, I think that I learned A LOT in Ls1b. I really really enjoyed the first half of the course (Kevin and Hopi are AMAZING)! Sure, Ls1b is not an easy class, but you have to take it for science\/pre-med, and it's honestly quite a good experience. My TF (Amy) was also amazing, I learned a LOT in section! Labs are sometimes annoying, but you usually don't have to write up lab reports, which is good. Ls1b is really not as bad as it used to be!!","great material, sometimes slow lecture pace but great resources\/help-structures","If you thought LS1a was bad, do yourself a favor and find another biology class take. The best way to describe LS1b is a struggle. The Head TF's are extremely unfriendly and unwilling to work with students. They are uncooperative. In fact, when I requested a section switch, the TF told me that research proves that which TF you have does not impact how students perform. I was completely baffled and could not believe that she had made such an outrageous statement. The whole point of coming to a school like Harvard is to learn from the best. By her logic I'd be better of teaching myself. The struggle does not end there the Head TF's are also really unrealistic and plan 1,000 different things to do for each section. This not only puts tremendous stress on the TF's, but we do not really learn much. Also while Professor Hoekstra and Professor Ruvolo are amazing the other two professors are subpar. Professor Sabeti's lectures are extremely disorganized. The lecture notes make no sense.","Ls1b was, surprisingly, one of my favorite classes this semester. Though a lot of people have said it was poorly taught in the past, I think that they really stepped up their game this year--the lecturers were so engaging and enthusiastic, and even if you miss lecture, there are plenty of online resources and section materials that can help you understand other concepts. In general, I really enjoyed the topics that were covered in this class and the way that they were taught. One thing that I did find unnecessary was the textbook--I didn't use it at all throughout the course.","Make sure to keep up with lectures and go to problem solving lectures!","It's pretty good.","I'd highly recommend it.  If you're interested in the material, now it couldn't be better taught.  So much exciting material here.  Amazing, available professors and wonderful lectures\/ lecture notes.","improved class, great professors, a little vague in what knowledge they expect you to know, covers too much knowledge","This class was terribly organized. The material is interesting, but they present it in the most complicated way possible to make your life suck. There are times, my study group questioned the purpose of the class and if it was to be able to have really detailed, specific answers from super ambiguous questions.","This course is bad. BAD. The material is so interesting but it's ruined by the horribly made psets and exam questions, the poor organization of the course, and the wording of the questions that constantly cost people points even when they know the material very well. I'm LIVID with this class because it casts such a horrible image on science courses at Harvard, and it makes me very worried about future courses I'll take. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAUTION.","You'll take this class because you have to. However, it is bad. Long labs, obnoxious psets, and boring lectures.","This class has made leaps and bounds from what I've heard from last year--the professors are so great and extremely approachable, so use office hours! Exams are pretty difficult and require a lot of studying, but it's definitely worth it.","This class has interesting material and is a broad overview of genetics and evolution. The tests are fair and cover what is covered in lecture.","The material for this class is interesting. The professors are all interesting and most of the lectures are effective, though Professor Sabeti's lectures were sometimes confusing. The exams test your ability to answer questions exactly how the teaching staff wants, so this class requires quite a bit of memorization.","A very average class overall. The professor's are all decent lecturers, the material is fairly interesting, and the Psets are reasonable, but lab section is incredibly long and tedious, often going over 3 hours.","LS1b is a much, much better class than its reputation suggests. Professor Eggan and Professor Hoekstra are awesome and their lectures are really interesting. Definitely go to the Friday review sessions even if you don't think you need to because they're incredibly helpful both in terms of understanding the material and doing the psets.","LS1b has a really bad reputation from a few years ago, but I can easily say the class has been totally transformed. There are still some rough spots here and there, but that's typical of any class. The content is engaging (after mitosis\/meiosis), the material is well-communicated, and expectations are clear. The teaching staff is very invested in answering student questions directly and tangentially related to course material. Go to office hours. Just do it.","Take this course only if you know you have to.","The exams were hard.  They were extremely nit-picky and sometimes the grading was unfair and unbalanced.  The course material is really interesting, but the lectures are very disorganized.","It is so much better than people tell you! I took it as a senior and actually really enjoyed it.","It was clear that the LS1B professors worked very hard to improve the course this year. Each professor was enthusiastic about the material that they taught, which they tried to make relevant and interesting to us. There are ups and downs to having four professors teaching a single course, but I think it works in LS1B's favor. In such a big class, it's hard to hold people's interest, and having multiple teachers, each with a unique personality and area of expertise, certainly makes things more interesting.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the genetics is all very interesting. In the middle of the course, things got a little dense when we got into quantitative genetics. But I found the material really good overall. The textbook goes into much more depth than what you're expected to know, and there can be a disconnect between the problems that are demonstrated in class and the level of difficult on the problem sets.  That being said, the exams seemed more in line with what was taught in lecture (rather than the problem sets or review session materials). My biggest complaint about the course was that problems on the psets and in labs could sometimes be very poorly written and confusing. The teaching staff did a fair job of clarifying things as problems arose but it did get a bit frustrating. Labs got a bit repetitive but the personalized genetics lab was fun, since we got to learn about our own genome in the process of learning the lab techniques.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was pleased with the course and appreciated the effort that teachers put into improving the class. So, don't shy away from LS1B because of things you might have heard! It's a very good class and gives you a good, solid foundation in genetics. Hopefully this year's Q scores will establish a good reputation for the class, since I sometimes felt like students were just looking to point out flaws because of how bad they heard the class had been in the past.","LS1b is definitely a better course now that it was in the past. All of the professors are very passionate about their work and it shows. It may not have been fantastic the whole time, but I actually found myself enjoying the course quite a bit.","When I compare the class as it was the semester, to how it was in past semesters, it has most certainly improved leaps and bounds. With new professors, a great list of TFs, and dedicated preceptors, the work they put into improving the course is laudable. The material is interesting, the lectures are engaging, and my overall course experience was fairly positive. All that being said, my strongest recommendation to students would be to not fall behind with lectures and make good friends with your TF. Also, the Friday review sessions are incredible useful. Even if you can't be there physically, I would strongly recommend reviewing those review session videos before the test.","It's really not as bad as I've heard it used to be; it's an informative class and you definitely learn a lot of cool stuff.","LS1B is a great class.  You learn about a lot of different topics in genetics that are all interesting.  I believe this class is much better than it has been in the past based on previous Q guides.  All of the lecturers are very interesting and learning the material is very enjoyable.","Be prepared to work hard and still be confused sometimes--there is a lot of material to chew through and not a lot of time to do it based on the pace of the class. But none of the material is super difficult. All of it makes sense; you just have to do a lot of wading through information to isolate what is important.","This course is not as bad as it was made out to be in previous years. It was frightening to have our entire grade depend on the final exam this year. Section and Problem Solving Lectures are your greatest assets. The book, not so much... don't worry about \"required\" readings. You'll waste a lot of time and energy on those. Lecture is kind of the same, but if you go and pay attention, you'll likely gain something.","Only take this class if you have to.","This class has improved drastically from past years. The addition of Dr. Kevin Eggan is a huge positive, as the material he teaches is incredibly interesting and he is a great and extremely engaging lecturer. However, once the course passes Professor Hoekstra's part, the material becomes much less interesting and the quality of the lectures under Pardis Sabeti and Maryellen Ruvolo decline very quickly. However, generally I liked the class, even if it does suffer from the typical inefficiencies and unfairness that characterizes all large introductory classes at Harvard. Psets are usually fair and not that long, but exams are ridiculously long and tough. Lot of reading if you want to keep up with every detail.","The lab portion is overly hectic and the lectures often lack grounding, but overall the material presented is fascinating.","go to PSLs and get extra help if you don't completely understand the material or have any questions whatsoever.","I really enjoyed this class. The professors were very enthusiastic about the course, and the lecture materials covered were really interesting. They did a very good job revamping it from previous years. The homework and exams interconnected really well.","This class is getting better and better, year after year.  Don't be scared of this course.  Just be prepared to devote hours to it.  I would suggest that you work on the psets alone, go to office hours, and do the practice problems AFTER you've gone through all of the material, and GONE TO CASEY'S PROBLEM SESSIONS.  Use the practice problems to STUDY for the test rather than to \"learn\" how to do the problems.  That will help you.  Good luck! :) Also, Kevin Eggan and Hopki are great!","Lots of work is expected outside of class. What you learned in lectures is not enough to do well in tests. You need to read textbooks and study more, or else.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading the book outside of class.  If you are willing to go to office hours, the problem sets are a little bit easier to do.  Lab does not require much time outside of class except for some pre-reading.","Do all the practice problems and read all the solutions to everything. Everything.","Kevin and Hopi are great. Pardis and Maryellen not such. Not very engaging, so you have to pay lots of attention during their lectures.","The best parts about this course are the all-star cast of professors and the subject matter. Your four professors are truly leaders in their fields, publishing in Science about this-and-that, becoming the youngest people to do such-and-such. They're actually famous. And for the most part, they're good lecturers. What are they lecturing about? Some of the most scintillating, up-to-date scientific advances that could affect you and your children in fantastic ways. \r\n\r\nThe worst part is the exams, which are the worst part because they are weighted heavily and are very tricky. An exercise that you will have been given numerous times will be presented in a slightly-tweaked format, just barely recognizable, all-but ensuring that you will get it at least partly wrong. Also the Psets are pretty hard.","It has good material thats important to learn but lectures are weak and sections are just awful. Caitlin was an amazing TF but the stuff that was put in the section was too much work.","This class is a requirement, so might as well take it ASAP. It's pretty good as a whole, but make sure you put the time in. The lectures don't really reflect the Psets or exams.","The lecturers and content are both very interesting and enjoyable.","I may be biased because I really like biology and genetics is, as yet, my favorite area of biology. However, I felt like this was a very worthwhile class that taught me many interesting and exciting new concepts and was very engaging.","If you do the work, you will do well.","LS1b tries too hard to make the students like it, and in doing so fails not only to be a good course but to generate student interest. Lecture slides are silly and cluttered, lecture time is wasted on silly activities, and it is nearly impossible to know what is actually expected of you. The class has a plethora of assignments, with numerous things due on any one date, and it's nearly impossible to keep track of all the moving parts. Finally, the class wastes time on silly activities and to compensate breezes through important concepts, making it hard to know what to do.\r\n\r\nLS1b is 70% Fraternity 30% Biology, the class needs to take itself seriously, don't expect this to be a well structured or very intellectual experience.","Take if needed for concentration","There is a lot of material and it's easy to fall behind so make sure you do the readings and practice problems. Lynne and Casey are good resources, so talk to them if you have trouble with the concepts and the learning goals make good study material.","Go to class.","You pretty much need to take this course as a premed. It has the potential to be very interesting, but many of the labs are extremely long and boring, and the material is not taught in the most interesting way. A few adjustments to how the material is presented could make this course great.","Lots of memorization. Lots of support. I liked Ls1a better.","Get through it for pre-med or bio fields, otherwise steer clear, it's not worth the stress.","You definitely learn about a lot of interesting stuff in this class (if you think genetics is cool). While the class is a lot of work, it's manageable if you keep up with the readings. I definitely recommend doing the readings! And go to office hours, they're fairly helpful. The professors are really nice and encouraging.","Contrary to popular belief, this class is actually pretty fun and interesting...at least for the first half of the year.  The material is fascinating and you learn a lot about genetics and the molecular foundations to biology. The second half of the year is a little confusing and not very fun, but if you push through the statistics and the confusing primate phylogenic names, you should be fine.  The exams are not difficult and the problem sets are significantly easier than those in LS1a. Overall, I would recommend the course, but only if you are a science concentrator or really like genetics.","This was a really good course for the most part. The exams and some problem sets are hard but they are manageable if you put the work in. The professors really care about the course and it is clear that they are working as hard as they can to make sure that every student understands the material and gets all the help they need. They are what makes this class great.","Wonderfully engaging course with some truly brilliant lecturers. Came in expecting a terrible experience but came out inspired and excited about genetics. GDP project was great!","Poorly organized and poorly taught","Be careful allotting time to complete and understand psets.","I think this class will continue to improve with time. The content is interesting but the presentation of materials could be improved.","It's a lot better now. Definitely doable and you really do learn a lot! But still read and study the material.","Be on top of everything and go to office hours.  There are a lot of things that you have to figure out for yourself that should probably be told to you but aren't.  Keep up with the schedule and outside of pset assignments as well.","The Good:\r\nThey're working really hard to make it better. The course material is interesting, a lot of it is about modern means of studying genetic diseases, which is really fascinating stuff. The professors are enthusiastic. \r\n\r\nThe Bad:\r\nThere's a lot they still need to fix. It's a poorly run class, what you learn in lecture is far simpler than what you're assigned to read in the textbook, which doesn't match what you're taught in section, which doesn't match what you need to know for exams and psets. It's SO frustrating to feel like you never know what you need to know. The Friday problem solving reviews are NOT OPTIONAL. So, either make sure you're free then and just put it on your schedule, or make sure you leave time to watch it online (it's filmed).\r\n\r\nThis is yet a good\/smooth course, it will be eventually. If you need to take it, take it. If you don't and you still have a few years at Harvard, then wait to take it. Also, MAKE SURE you get a good TF, ask around.","If you're interested in biology, take this course. As in any introductory course, it varies a lot as it covers a broad range of topics, but some of them can be very interesting (and others pretty dull).","Problem sets can really ask unspecific or vague questions.","Go to office hours when you have questions with key concepts.  Don't allow your problems to build up until you are at a disadvantage for exams.","Interesting material, could be presented more clearly sometimes","Make sure your TF is good.  The readings don't really help.  Dr. Roerhig's review sessions (and Dr. Roerhig herself) are AWESOME.  Do practice problems.","This class is a lot of work but it's a pre-req for almost all science concentrations so youj ust have to get through it.","It's really not that bad.  I had the impression it'd be worse; expect a pretty normal class.","Don't underestimate the bad stories. They're true however the teaching staff and PSL program are both great resources! Ruvolo has done a good job as I understand it of improving the course from past years.","Be prepared when planning your course load that this class is harder or at least more time consuming than you might anticipate.","This course, as you'll most likely hear from many others, covers some very interesting material. You finish the course with an understanding of the genetics behind cats, dogs, people, plants, and almost everything else... and that's a good feeling. With that said, the course is challenging, especially if you don't have a strong background in biology, as I hadn't. The course is definitely doable, but to do very well, a lot of additional effort may be needed.","You probably have to take this course as a requirement. It isn't too bad really. You learn a lot, the professors are really committed to making it a good experience, and there is a lot of really interesting material to cover. Labs are really long and some of them are pretty boring, but there are also some cool labs where you get to analyze your own DNA. Although genetics inevitably can be a little dry, I think this course truly does get at the big picture and is run quite well.","Good class and interesting material. You will here a lot of terrible things about this course, but I found much of it to be false (either that or the class was heavily revamped). In my opinion better than LS1A, but that may be due to my exceptional TF. Stay on top of assignments and use resources - YOU WILL BE FINE.","Premed Course Alert: genetics is interesting, but the course is all about fighting daily for your grade with chores and silly assignments. Never was there a truly hard problem to think about.","Avoid this course if at all possible. It's easy, but completely miserable. The course doesn't know whether it wants to teach biology or a be a frat. It's about 70:30 in favor of frat right now. You're probably much better off if you put off biology for a bit, then do MCB 52 or 54 when you have the time, in conjunction with LS2, to fulfill pre-med requirements. You'll learn a lot more there and not be made to feel like a middle schooler.","If you are interested in genetics, this is an excellent class. The material is interesting, the lectures are pretty good as far as lectures go, the professors are good speakers and instructors, and the psets aren't too bad. I personally really enjoyed the class, and it was definitely a pleasant surprise after all the bad things I had heard about it. They've definitely stepped it up in the past couple years!","The first part of the class is relatively easy, but don't let that fool you. Keep on your game and the class will be fine - amusing even.","I absolutely loved this class.  The professors are some of the best parts about it--all 4 of them are funny, interesting, and passionate about their sections and the class as a whole.  The midterms aren't easy but they're not difficult either, and the final was manageable.  The psets are typically pretty short, and usually the labs are also, with the exception of a few weeks.  Also in the labs you get to sequence a few of your own genes to see whether you have the mutations associated with lactase persistence, being an endurance runner, and a few other traits, and these are all pretty cool to see!  Basically, you should take this class!","I would say to only take this class if you need to. It's poorly graded and the information is scattered. They demand too much reading of you and, again, the grading is shit. You'll probably take this if you're premed. Just plow through it, get a good study group going, and kick some LS1b butt.","LS1b really isn't as bad as it is sometimes made out to be. The professors are so enthusiastic about the material, and it shows. Stay on top of the readings, as they actually do help.","You are probably taking this class because you have to. Be patient with them. They are still learning.","It is a very difficult and time consuming class with a lot of work - account for that.  The material is covered very very quickly, not in much depth, and a ton of material at once, so you might not get the best understanding of it just from lectures, so you'll probably have to do outside work\/reading.","This class will definitely challenge your ability to both absorb large quantities of information and synthesize the main points for novel applications. This course definitely requires collaboration to complete the problem sets, but this is no way a bad thing. I sincerely believe this class is worthwhile if you want to understand the advancements that have been made in the field of genetics thus far, and also the possibilities and applications that exist in the fields of evolution and disease treatment.","The class is on an upward trend.  Q-scores from years past may be misleading.","It is good if you take advantage of all the resources. In general the course is demanding.","It was a decent class -- you'll learn about a diverse range of research topics, many of which are quite relevant to current work in the field.","Anindya Sen best TF ever, Pardis unclear","It's getting better. Eggan and Hoekstra are great lecturers.","This class is not as bad as everyone says! They made great improvements this year! Do not dread it at all!!","Don't be afraid of this class but also be prepared to be annoyed with some organizational issues.  Overall, the material and labs are interesting, but the professors vary in teaching strength.","LS1b had a terrible reputation in the past and I can't speak for past years, but I would definitely recommend it now. It was my favorite course this semester, and I genuinely enjoyed learning the material. The course covers a wide variety of interesting topics and lectures are fun to go to because there are videos and demonstrations. All of the professors work hard to make it an entertaining and engaging course. The professors and teaching staff are extremely accessible, so if you are committed to doing well in the course, anyone can be successful. Section is a good complement to the extremely large lecture format.","The course material is interesting, but the course is not taught very well. Too bad everyone concentrating in the life sciences or doing pre-med has to take it...","Let's be real, if you're taking this course you probably have no other choice. As i understand it, the course has gotten exponentially better in the last few years and that is encouraging. Many of the lecturers in this year were teaching the course for the first time, so parts of it were shaky. Kevin's material is relatively basic and, to be honest, could be handled more efficiently in fewer lectures. Hoppi's a pro and deals well with her material, but please go to her office hours to understand some important nuances (eg. heritability, what it is and what it isnt, and the difference between cytoplasmic inheritance and maternal effect etc.) Pardis is clearly brilliant, but i found her lectures to be the most confusing, so beware. Maryellen is extremely interesting, but beware of the phylogeny diagrams which are trickier than they look.","LS1B is notorious for being a horrible class, but it has gotten exponentially better over the past two years. The content is extraordinary (albeit confusing at times), and the class is actually very well-organized. Be ready to work hard, but it is definitely worth taking.","you will learn a lot, but the material is not taught extremely well","The class is better than it was in the past. However, I was still miserable because even though I slave away at assignments like psets, papers, and labs, in the end the exams are the only thing worth anything. No matter how well you do in any other portion of the class, there is absolutely no safety net should you do poorly on your exams.","This is a typical intro class that covers many relevant topics (personalized genetics, ChIP assays, human evolution) but does not go into great detail about any of those topics. This class does not take up much time (you can succeed without doing most of the readings) and the tests and quizzes were all fairly predictable.","Very interesting class, but very work intensive and hard","The bad news is, this class - for lack of a more polite way to say this - really sucks. The even worse news is, you probably have to take it if you're thinking about doing anything remotely related to science, or premed. So it's really like an inescapable evil. The professors are great, brilliant minds, don't get me wrong- I felt lucky to have sat in on their lectures about some truly interesting phenomena. That said though, the course is just so disorganized and I often had no clue what to hone in on as far as exams. The lab component is also terrible; there was always so much actual section material to cover, that all the steps for the actual lab work just get annoying and uninteresting. I've never felt so frustrated with a class before. I really hope that they improve this class for future years.","Make it a goal to ask one question every class. The professors love it, you have a chance to converse with and be known by your brilliant professors, and it keeps you more engaged to always be searching for something that was not explained.","I think this class improved vastly from previous years, from perception of the course this year. Personally, I loved the class. It is very applicable if you are thinking of doing lab work at Harvard, especially anything related to genetics. There are lots of opportunities to get help. I would highly recommend the peer study leader sessions before problem sets are due, and the Friday problem-solving sessions with Casey as they are extremely helpful for doing the problem set. Use these resources!","The coursework is relevant and applicable - but the course is not taught well and the lectures simply try to cram too much information. The lectures, especially those given by Dr. S, were outright confusing and made PSETs and exams very frustrating. LS1b needs new lecturers! A self-study class for sure.","Profs and TFs work extremely hard to make this enjoyable. The individual units throughout the semester are all actually really interesting, and you get to do some really cool labs. Learned a lot. Problem set questions can be a bit unclear at times but tests are quite straightforward.","This class is a hodgepodge of nonsense. Why it is required for all life sciences concentrations I will never know. You won't learn anything you don't already know and it's an absolute waste of time. If you don't HAVE to take this class, then DON'T.","Your experience in this class is entirely dependent on your TF, and I unfortunately had a really incompetent TF who wasn't an effective teacher and a really harsh grader that returned assignments late (we got our first lab back on the last week of class). There's a terrible amount of busywork in this class - sometimes, there are two problem sets due a week along with lab writeups and other random things. The material can be interesting, but the disorganization of the class can make learning tough. Some of the questions written on the homework's\/exams are vaguely phrased and thus, difficult to answer and do well on. Going to the PSL sessions really made the course bearable, but even then, the PSLs don't have all the answers.","This class has improved greatly and I am sure next year they will fix any kinks and make it better. The work is overwhelming at times, but the material is really interesting and the professors are great.","You are probably a pre-med (props to those of you who aren't and are still going through this hell... though I wonder if you are completely sane..) and you are going to have to take this class. And Harvard knows it. Try all they might to get interesting lecturers, the class as a whole is ambiguous and no amount of studying can help if you are just bad at understanding the questions. That was my biggest failure in the class. I did understand the material, just not what LS1b wanted me to answer. That is not how a class should be.","Don't take it if you're not a science person.","They're working hard to improve the course, it's not at all as bad as I expected it to be. If they keep the same professors, Kevin and Hopi are great and pretty easy to learn from; Pardis and Maryellen are intelligent people but be prepared to seek outside help to supplement their lectures as they can gloss over important things that you will need to know well for exams. Casey, the preceptor, is amazing. Go to her PSLs and ask her for help, take advantage of that and it will make things a lot easier. In general, this isn't such a bad course. The real difficulty in this class is just managing workload and expectations.","Conceptually, the material is really interesting and the professors are awesome. Actually, though, I was very frustrated with the structure of the course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it ended up being much more work and more stressful than I expected (with lab assignments\/PSETS\/the GDP project). The lab quizzes before each lab were not fun; I felt like I had to attend the extra Friday afternoon problem-solving review sessions because they covered material that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covered in class but did show up on the psets; lectures were entertaining but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delve deep enough into the material (and all too often we would waste class time on a fun demo but end up rushing at the end of lecture and\/or barely covering the essential material); it seemed like we spent more time learning basic statistics calculations than genetics\/evolution in class; it was nearly impossible to do all of the readings on top of all the other stuff they expected us to do. Also, my TF wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great, so section was always a drag. We did do some cool things, though, like personalized genetics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sequencing our own DNA for genes that are associated with certain traits (such lactose intolerance, endurance running, sleep\/wake tendencies, ability to taste bitter compounds, etc) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and study transgenic organisms (like glowing C. elegans and zebrafish embryos).\r\nOne thing I wish I had done was go to the professors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they seem like such amazing, fun people and it would be great to get to know them and the work that they do outside of class.","I'd tell them that you definitely learn a lot but that it can get quite unorganized. If you keep track of your assignments, actually go to class, and keep up with readings, then it can be quite doable.","Go to Casey's problem solving, all of them!","It's a gateway course.  I might as well recommend it.  Plus, it's bad!  It's mostly on the student to be an active learner. This is how she learns!","This class is extremely interesting (you honestly don't even need to read the textbook). Hopi's lectures are amazing","LS 1b seems to have a bad reputation at Harvard. I don't know if it used to be bad or not, but I can say that Spring 2013 was a great class with great profs. It definitely deserves a better rep than it has.","I find genetics interesting in general but this is probably one of the most notorious intro courses here, no joke. It's on the up and I still found it poorly organized. If you're pre-med like me, just hold your friends close and try not to weep.","Almost everyone takes this course because it is required and sometimes it does seem like a chore.The problem sets can be a little lengthy. The exams are pretty fair.","Read the textbook because it clarifies the material, sometimes better than the lectures.","If you are interested in genetics and evolution, this is definitely a good class. Be careful of the enormous mass of information that the course covers as well as the super vague questions that never really quite articulate how one is supposed to give an answer. None of the material was really inherently difficult but there is a lot of it.","This class isn't too bad, as long you keep on top of the p-sets. They are pretty intractable if you don't get help from the TFs or help sessions, so make sure to ask for help.","It doesn't matter what I say, you're going to take it anyway.","Don't let the bad reputation scare you - this was one of the best courses I have ever taken!  Whatever dark history this class has has been worked out.  Lecture was great, labs were great, and I thought grading was fair.  The material was very interesting, especially near the end of class.","This course helped to reconfirm my dislike of genetics. It is more of a statistical science and in the level of this course deals somewhat less with the biology. I would not recommend this to people who are not fond of stats.","Unless you really have to, don't take Ls1b freshman spring as your interests may change and you might not have to take ls1b for a concentration requirement.","make sure to go to office hours and really understand everything you're doing or else the exams will be terrible!","Great class but keep up with the lectures and reading the book I am sure helps","The class honestly seems a little disorganized. The topics covered are very diverse but there's not a lot of depth to anything we cover. You have to know just enough about way too many topics so solving problems on problem sets and exams can be difficult. The lectures are not very helpful.","Take it if you need it as a requirement. It's not a bad course, but I wouldn't take it just if you're interested in taking genetics for the heck of it.","If you are confused, ask these question immediately after class or soon after. This class has a lot of reading, which is not actually necessary or helpful. There's so much information taught in the course. Start asking early what is important, so you can learn with the right frame of mind.","There's been a lot of bad rumors circulating around Ls1b. They may have been true in the past, but this course is moving in the right direction with much better instruction and guidance through online resources, additional lectures, and more support in general.","Take it if you have to","They really improved this class. The assignments are reasonable, and the course material is infinitely more interesting than what LS1a covers. Furthermore, the professors are wonderful. If you go to problem solving sessions and read the textbook, you'll be fine.","Read assigned reading before class\/lecture","I was really dreading taking this class after all I had heard about it from other students, but it actually ended up being one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard so far (better than LS1a in my opinion).  The lectures are interesting, the labs are for the most part pretty cool, and the workload is manageable.  The exams were relatively tough, so make sure to study for them quite a bit.","Life Sciences 1b presented some of the most interesting material I learned at Harvard all year, but the ridiculous level of bureaucracy - four professors, two preceptors, and countless teaching fellows and assistants -required for such a course of even more ridiculous size made LS1b a truly painful experience. The three hours of each weekly section were rarely sufficient to complete each lab activity and the section problems without rushing.  The four lecturers (Are there not enough classes for Harvard professors to teach?) varied widely in the quality of their lecturing.  Prof. Maryellen Ruvolo and Prof. Hopi Hoekstra were excellent lecturers.  They presented the material effectively and left students well prepared to tackle problem sets and exam problems. Prof. Sabeti's lectures, however, were severely disappointing. Her lectures and demonstration were unclear and ineffective (She used at least four slides in her first lecture to present her background!); her follow-ups often obfuscated material to an even greater extent; she had someone with a Ph.D. from MIT act as a teaching assistant, doing her board work in lecture (despite the two preceptors and countless teaching fellows the course already had).  Although her lecture on infectious disease was fascinating, the bulk of her material left students confused and dissatisfied.\r\nThe readings assigned in this course are quite helpful and often rather interesting, but there is simply not enough time to finish all of them in the timeframe assigned by the teaching staff (i.e., before lecture) and stay on top of other coursework.  Practice problems are extremely useful, provided you have the time to do them.  The Friday afternoon review sessions given by Dr. Casey Roehrig, one of the preceptors, were the most helpful parts of the class, and should be attended (or at least viewed online) each week.    \r\nThe most disappointing thing about LS1b was that there was really no way to avoid it: if you are a Harvard undergraduate with the intent of concentrating in any field whose name ends with \"biology\" (or any of the other Life Sciences), you currently have no alternative to this perennially poorly rated course.  This fact makes me wonder why I am taking so much time to give such detailed responses to this questionnaire, since Harvard College clearly tends to collect as much feedback as possible and then wholly ignore it.  There should be another course that fulfills the LS1b requirement (like the LPSA\/LS1a option). Should such an alternative arise, take it - barring major changes to the size and structure of this course.","It was hard but it was really interesting and it was fun to learn about your own genetic make up.","This class was much better than it was in previous years. Nothing to be too worried about. The lecturers were on the whole very passionate, and if you get a good TF you can learn a lot about genetics.","They improved the class this year significantly. I enjoyed it because I really enjoy genetics, but the evolution unit was kind of a drag. Work-wise it's not too terrible; there are 1-2 problems sets a week (usually one) and sometimes post-lab questions. There are two midterms, one final, and one project due in stages that's actually pretty interesting. Most of the people taking this course take it to fulfill concentration\/premed requirements. I really wouldn't take it for fun because it can be kind of tedious. But if you have to take it, just get through it. It's really not that bad especially if you've had some basic biology before.","Lots of interesting info, you get to sequence your own DNA!!","Go to Casey's problem solving reviews and office hours WHENEVER possible. Stay on top of things--the final is a smack in the face. Do the readings if you can. Despite these comments, the class is totally doable and rewarding. Glad I took it -- it's a god overview of genetics.","it's quite difficult and you have to be willing to put in a lot of hours. But overall, the course was fairly well done.","It may have had bad reviews in the past, but this year LS1b was fantastic. The material is much more interesting than LS1a (in my opinion), and the professors all were good lecturers (Hopi was the best). A huge variety of resources offered and well-organized. Some psets could be moderately challenging, but never too difficult. Some were downright easy. The exams were the most difficult part, but nothing too extreme. I came in terrified because of the history this class has had, but in the end I enjoyed this much more than LS1a. Don't be afraid to try it out!","This course is not the old LS1b, it's a thousand times better. But it'll be hard if you're not interested in the material.","I hated this class, and I really don't mean to exaggerate. It was unreasonably difficult, and I often left section or lecture feeling so dumb and as if there was no way for me to get help. I think that major improvements need to be made to this class in order for it to be enjoyable by any means.","It's a good class that is well organized. I think it has definitely improved in the last couple of years.  Psets and labs are generally very doable and not difficult.  Midterms and the final Exam were all very difficult, as would be expected with this type of course.  Those take a lot of studying time.","Its a good class, the material is interesting and the psets are doable. Ultimately if you have to take this class for your major or pre-med, just take it, it won't be that bad. Also, you do not need to do any of the readings.","This class is worth taking on the merit of the material alone; everyone should have the chance to learn about genetics and its relevance in our lives. The professors are really enthusiastic and engaging; they are very accessible and open and responsive to your ideas. This course still has some growing to do as half of the professors are new to the course, but overall I found it to be one of the best organized and well structured classes I have ever taken. My only real complaint is that the one and a half hour lectures can be pretty brutal to sit through...","This course, although very informative and an overall enjoyable class, requires 100% of your effort throughout the entire term. To get the most out of this class, fully utilize all the resources provided. The problem solving sessions are also helpful for most units.","Take this course only if you have a good foundation in science and enjoy taking science courses.","The lectures, workload, and course itself is great. However, the exams are very hard.","You'll either like it a lot or hate it.","Despite this course's unfortunately history of Q scores, I think the professors have definitely turned it around! They present the information in a fascinating way and really try to keep the class interested and excited.","Compared to LS1a, I really came to enjoy this class a lot. The professors were great and though the work load each week was significant, the resources to get support was always available.","This course is definitely manageable, but with work. The lectures were engaging, the problem sets were doable, and overall you can succeed in this course. One must be ready to put in work however to fully understand the material.","A little disorganized, which made me uneasy, but not so bad at its core.","You're probably taking this because you have to. It's a little better than it has been in the past, but it still has a long way to go.","Really a much better job than I expected. Can be a bit dry and confusing at times, but generally engaging and interesting.","LS1b can be very challenging at times, however, the teaching staff is very helpful (especially Casey) and if you go to office hours and ask for help, it's not bad. Try to go to the Friday problem solving lectures because the p-sets are essentially entirely based off those (but you can watch online if you can't make it). The professors were very engaged and they had a lot of office hours (also on different days) to make sure that you could go. First exam was very fair but second one was very tricky. Make sure to study *everything* on the lecture slides and definitely know how to do the heavy math problems for exams. Also, use the textbook- Pierce is a great reference- and it aligns well with what is being taught in lecture.","So LS1b was described to me as an absolute nightmare. I will say it was not quite as bad as I was told....but it certainly wasn't overly enjoyable either. The bottom line is it is interesting subject matter, but the course itself isn't very well designed. Section is 3 hours and always incredibly over-scheduled--we'll be expected to complete a entire lab (sometimes 2) as well as go over material from the week's lectures AND a packet's worth of practice problems. Not surprisingly, I tended to feel overwhelmed and more concerned with getting all this stuff done than actually learning the material. Overall, the course is manageable but a hassle.","It was difficult and I often found myself questioning why certain aspects of the class were necessary or important.","This class throws a lot of information at you at once. In addition, questions and tests are phrased in very complicated and convoluted ways that sometimes left me unable to tell what answer they wanted or how in depth I was meant to respond. Something that will help is reviewing the lecture slides and readings before class. The readings weren't always helpful, but sometimes they helped explain the more difficult concepts.","This class has the potential to be enjoyable. If you have a good TF, it will be fine. I would suggest having an interest in genetics, population genetics, and some evolution if you wish to take this course.","Psets are difficult, not as fulfilling as ls1a in my opinion, or as forgiving.","The p-sets are not hard but expect to put a lot of time into the class. There is a lot of material to cover and a lot of work to be done. Often lecture and section aren't sufficient and office hours\/problem solving sessions are a seemingly mandatory part of the coarse load.","You have to take it anyway, so it doesn't really matter what I say about whether or not you should take it in the first place.  I never once looked at the textbook or did any of the required\/recommended readings, and I did well enough on midterms and psets.  Go to lecture and try your best to pay attention\/stay awake (or actually watch the lectures online) because once finals come around you'll hate yourself if you don't.  Don't fall behind.  This class covers a lot of material pretty quickly, and not all of it builds on each other so you have to review a lot of things for the final.","This has interesting lectures but you must practice problems and figure a lot out on your own","Take this class! Genetics is interesting in itself, but this class makes the material 100 times better! I went into this class expecting to hate it (at one point, the Q scores for this class were below a 2!). TAKE THIS CLASS!!!","The subject material of LS1b is pretty interesting but the way it's presented and how the course is organized can be somewhat of a turnoff at times.","Interesting course with some great professors. Tests can be unexpectedly tricky.","Someone asked me if they should take this class just for fun. For that reason, I would say no. However, if required, this class can be bearable. Maybe not the most enjoyable, but as all large classes it has both its high and low points.","Kevin Eggan and Hopi Hoekstra are the best! Ruvolo is good too. Pardis needs to explain concepts slower... Assignments are useful, and not too hard. Tests are fair. Labs are super long, but not unbearable. The most annoying part of this class is the GDP- or the semester long \"project.\" It's just annoying to do those extra long assignments.","Don't be scared off from LS1B because of the negative reviews in previous years. With the great new team of lecturers and TFs, the class is definitely manageable. The lectures are interesting and cover most of the material that is necessary for the class. The psets sometimes contain material that was not covered extensively in lecture, so having a good study group of people doing the pset together is helpful. The exams were generally fair, but sometimes there were problems that weren't emphasized from lectures\/psets. I think that for the most part, this was a fair class that could use some improvement in organization but that is still interesting and doable regardless.","You can surely learn a lot from this course if you put the time into it (i.e. doing all the required readings, going to office hours, understanding everything completely). Many of the concepts are extremely applicable to real life, and it will be a solid foundation for any biology concentration. However, I've found that putting so much time was not very enjoyable; I always felt like there were better things to do with my time.","LS1b was better than LS1a and probably better than it has been in past years. The material was easier for me personally because I took AP Biology right before coming here. The online textbook is a MUST HAVE because literally for some topics the lectures teach you nothing but the book teaches you everything. Seriously, if the class is like this in the future the online Textbook is the best thing you can do. In terms of lecture, the professors are hit-or-miss. Kevin underwhelmed me but had great vests; HOPI WAS AMAZING and actually made me pay attention and had great slides; Maryellen was interesting but i barely went to her lectures; Pardis is a horrible teacher but a fascinating person.","It was a great course, and the labs and lectures were fascinating and engaging. I especially enjoyed genotyping myself and figuring out where on the tree I fell in terms of mtDNA.","They're definitely trying to make the course better - all members of the teaching staff were great.  That being said, the way questions are worded is sometimes annoying, and if you don't answer things with the exact words they're looking for you might not get credit.","The most important aspect of this class is the ability to solve application problems. If you do well on the Psets, you will do well on the exams.","Read the textbook.\r\nBased on the lectures, the class is deceptively easy, but keeping up with the textbook readings should dispel that notion. \r\nAlso, start preparing early for the final exam.","The professors in this class are great.  While the lectures aren't necessarily always the most clear, they really make an effort to make the information relevant and interesting. It covers a lot of important background concepts in biology.","It's a tough class but the changes made over the years are starting to pay off and its not a particularly bad experience.","LS1b no longer has the bad reputation that it did!  It is much better than LS1a.","It's a pain pre-meds must endure.","I thought this class was really interesting. However, it's definitely a lot of work and I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't Pre-med or concentrating in a Life Science. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the material and the labs!","LS1B is manageable but a lot of work.  If you keep up with the lectures and make sure you understand the material for each problem set, it is not horrible.  The tests are difficult but not unreasonable.","The material taught in this course is very interesting, even if it is not taught that well. The professors put in a lot of effort to make the material fun and engaging and always try to make themselves available to students, so definitely take advantage of that. Overall, decent course.","only take it if you really love bio or you are premed....otherwise you don't need the stress","This course takes more work than it would seem, so it must no be underestimated. The collection of themes it provides, furthermore, can feel a bit dry by the end as the questions the course elicits, at the introductory level, are largely without an answer. In this way, I think the course should be reorganized and wouldn't really recommend students take it, at least point, unless ALL themes are of particular interest and you are willing to do extra reading to provide context for the ideas derived from the course.","LS1b is a fantastic class,  though it is quite challenging. The faculty members are ready to answer any questions students might have. I really enjoyed the labs we did in section. If you take this class, just be ready to work hard. It is definitely worth it, and the GDP symposium is amazing.","This class is easier than LS1a.","It's a better class than LS1a, that's for sure, but it moves a little slowly through things like Mendelian genetics that honestly, probably everyone in the course has already seen before. Most of the lectures are really engaging, though (Maryellen's a little hit or miss; Pardis does an impressive job of making statistics almost interesting). Almost everyone who takes it does so for a requirement, so you probably can't get out of it anyway; it's really not that bad, though.","This class provides the fundamentals for the material, and through it, students are introduced to various related concentrations. The professors, TFs, preceptors and PSLs are all approachable and helpful, and the sections and problem-solving lectures are good for reinforcing materials. Your individual efforts determine what you get out of the class, but you learn a lot and the class was enjoyable overall.","The class is frustrating at times but is taught well.","I have mixed feelings about this class because the professors were all clearly trying so hard and were all approachable and funny and charismatic. That being said, the course itself is 90% a repeat of LS1a and AP Bio until the first midterm (honestly, it sometimes felt like a waste of my time... I don't think anyone really paid attention in lecture ever. It became 1.5 hours for sleep\/Facebook\/Tumblr\/Buzzfeed instead), and then suddenly it got very confusing after that. It's not as bad of a class as everyone makes it out to be, but I wasn't ever particularly excited either... Especially since labs often felt tedious (though the personalized genetics ones often had amusing results). Unless they change the course significantly, don't bother buying the textbook; it's wicked expensive and I only read one page of it. \r\nTo get the most out of this class, just try to get to know the professors. I managed to get a research internship in London this summer because I talked to Kevin Eggan! The professors are all experts in their fields, so take advantage of that fact if you have to take this course anyway.","It's hard, especially if you're not good at biology. It's even harder if you have an awful TF, which I did. (apparently there's a lot of bad TFs...)\r\n\r\nWith that said, the professors are awesome and the material is really interesting. You cover a ton of material though, and it's hard to stay up with it. So even though I probably didn't do that well I the class, I'm glad I took it. As a class, it has improved from prior years, but it still has a long way to go...","This class has definitely improved from previous years. I really enjoyed the material and my TF was incredible and the professors (Hoekstra and Ruvolo especially) are fantastic lecturers, but the course still has flaws and is a big investment for time and energy. I thought the final was very fair and well written, though can't really say the same for the psets.","The class has been improved a lot. I had a great time learning the materials about genetics -- they are so fascinating! If you choose to take this class, make sure you do the readings, which seem to be a lot but are very important in clarifying the concepts in lectures. Do enough practice problems as well, because sometimes you may the problems in the exams hard even though you know the concepts.","Most of the people who take this have to, so there's not much to say. It's much better than years past and the instructors really try to teach you something. There are too many small assignments and little things, but the material is interesting and taught well. Preceptors are great.","I took it for a requirement dreading it but it's not as bad as people say it is.  Some of the lectures were pretty dry but a lot were really interesting.  That being said, I wouldn't recommend it unless you need it.","Take advantage of the PSL sessions.  Casey (one of the head TFs) did an amazing job explaining complex concepts and really helped me!","The class is a lot of work for sure, but you feel like you are learning useful material that is both current and engaging.  The professors were excellent and all very knowledgable in their respective fields.  The organization of the course is great.  The major drawbacks: many hours per week (3-hour lab, 3 hours of lecture, 1.5 hours of problem solving, 1-3 hours on problem sets), and the grading breakdown was somewhat absurd (very large emphasis on the final exam at around 50% this year).  Finally, the GDP portion was a highlight.  Overall, not as bad as the hype, and better than LS1a.","If the course is necessary for your concentration, take it.  If not, I would make sure that you have a real interest in genetics before you invest your time into the course.  It can be very fast paced and the questions can be rather frustrating, so a real interest in the material would be helpful to get through it.","The concepts they cover regarding genetics is very interesting and much of the staff are great to have as professors.","I really loved learning about genetics and I think the Ls1b staff did a great job this year changing Ls1b's previous reputation. The problem sets are like mini challenging puzzles and the course had many great lectures that had some interesting topics. Even I found the labs (though 3 hours long and very time consuming) to be interesting. They designed the problem sets and exams to be more applicable to the lectures this year and did a great job in generating enthusiasm. I would say it's a do-able class, not particuarly too hard, and mainly hard to get a good grade just because of the sheer amount of students (high concentration of pre-meds) who take the class.","This was a great class, the subject material was incredible, but the exams and quiz were kind of a bitch.  Definitely be prepared to put work into this class and you will do well.  Lots of studying is required.","There's a lot of memorization, but you need to know this material so it's worthwhile. It's a fairly painless way to learn important concepts. I actually enjoyed the class","Take this course only if you really want to learn about genetics.","Take advantage of office hours!","It's a tough class and quite a bit of work. The material is very interesting although sometimes I questioned the manner in which it was taught.","I came into this class expecting a boring a difficult class, but it was much better than I expected. The staff really cares about students and they definitely make it so that hard working students can do well in the class. If you put the work into it you will come out enjoying the class. The material is interesting and the lecturers are funny, which keep you awake, most of the time. Though older versions of the class have bad reputations don't let that keep you away. I am definitely glad i took the class instead of trying to get out of it.","This class is definitely not as bad as it is rumored to be. Actually this was my favorite class this semester. The calculations can be difficult and there is a lot of material but it is definitely doable.","Enjoy lecture - do problem sets early and check assumptions with preceptors.  Be agressive.","This course was much better than I thought it was going to be. The work wasn't bad, and the material was very interesting. All of the lecturers were great, and it was overall an enjoyable course.","LS1b is really working hard to become a better course; and you will learn a lot if you take the time to understand the material fully!","Stay as far away from LS1b as you can.  Taking this course will hopefully be my largest mistake at Harvard.","First of all, you need to teach yourself a lot of the material. The lectures go over what you need to know but then you have to actually go and make sure you know those things. I suggest getting into the habit of blocking out some time after each lecture to go over the material you learned during that lecture (google things you don't understand, write down questions, make flashcards.) Also you absolutely don't need to buy the textbook. I didn't open it once and did well in the class.","Problem sets are good to study in preparation for the exams. Overall this class is pretty fair in terms of material tested and tests themselves. Pardis' lectures could get a little dry sometimes, but I definitely recommend paying attention to them or reading the textbook\/notes because Hardy-Weinberg stuff can get confusing if you don't keep up with material. Sometimes labs are annoying and the GDP project is definitely lengthy and at times feels like busywork; however the symposium at the end is really cool and worth attending. Generally I enjoyed the class, and thought it was a pretty good class given that it's also a pre-med requirement and requirement for many other biology concentrations.","This was probably one of the worse classes I have ever taken at Harvard. The course material was very unorganized and I wished that the teaching fellows were the ones leading course instead. Problem sets, labs, and tests focused more on terminology than actual problem-solving and concepts, which made it very frustrating for many students.","I think that this course needs some changes. I would recommend looking at other options for filling the gen-ed\/pre-med requirements. While the material is interesting it is quite disorganized. On the positive side, I did learn a lot. However I thought that the course's disorganization made things more difficult than they needed to be.","The depth of knowledge needed for the exams is a bit further than the problem sets, section problems, and practice exams would lead you to believe. Stay on top of the material in order to succeed.","Make sure you attending Casey's problem-solving review sessions. Also, take full advantage of peer study resources as well as resources offered by the staff.","It's a tough class that requires a lot of work. If you're interested in the subject, you'll like it\/love it. if you're not too interested, you'll have to bear through it, which will be difficult. I still recommend it, the lecturers are good overall.","The material is hard but definitely manageable - don't hesitate to use resources. Lectures sometimes may be unhelpful at times - need\/desirable to go to office hours","The office hours and preceptors' hours were an excellent resource in this class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I don't know anyone who takes this just for fun, it's more of a required course for sciencey people. It's a fair amount of work to understand some of the material, but some of it does get pretty interesting. The exams were a bit tough, and I could never really do the psets (and get them right) by myself. But if you go to all the resources they give you and have people explain things to you, you'll end up okay. They definitely improved it from past years. Still a little frustrating though.","Unfortunately LS1b is a requirement for many life sciences majors. However, if you can avoid taking this class, you really should avoid it. The material is not that interesting and you are assigned a lot of time-consuming work. If you need to fulfill a biology pre-med requirement, LS2 is a much much much better option. If you have to take it, try to find a group of friends to work on psets together because its gonna be a long and bumpy semester.","Study hard","The class is very large and filled with many premed students, so, in that sense, it is similar to LS1a. I found the course material more interesting, however, and I liked my section which made for an overall okay experience in the class.","This course is truly what you make of it. If you invest your time wholeheartedly and do the readings before lecture, you will get a lot more out of it. Skipping lecture and not caring about p-sets and other assignments will not help you get anything out of LS1B. Some of the material is a bit of a chore, but if you look for interesting things, you'll find them.","LS1b is a course with the right material but implemented in a way that isn't too perfect. I've heard LS1b has improved from recent years, so it is working on getting better but it isn't perfect. The best you can do is to make the most of the opportunities afforded to you. Go to problem solving sessions. Do all the practice problems included for each lecture. Stay on top of the lectures and material--there is a lot to study for each exam. You actually don't need the textbook too much. Some people have told me it helps in solidifying information, but I found the textbook to be a useless waste of time. Attend to office hours and make use of all the opportunities the professors make to reach out to you. While I don't have a formula for success in this course, doing that will make the class a lot more bearable.","Though there are still improvements to be made in certain areas, this course is way better than some of the nightmare stories of LS1b in past years. The professors are great and the material is relatively interesting.","It is difficult, there is no easy way out of this class.","Only take this course if it is required.  Don't put yourself through it just to dabble in the sciences or for fun.","This course has interesting topics but is very difficult to follow. I would say to only take this class if you need to for a concentration requirement.","It is too much but if you want to do real genetics and learn wonderful stuff, definitely take it. It teaches you what people actually do in research.","It's a necessary evil but they have revamped it since the past to make it really accessible for students to get help.","It's the worst and the best class I have taken so far.  It is an eye-opener to how cutthroat pre-med kids can be and the material is very interesting.  However, if the material does not appeal to you, do not take this course because it is a boring nightmare otherwise.","This class is certainely not as bad as people say it is. The staff worked really hard to improve their reputation and Q scores and their efforts payed off. However, the course is still disorganised. There is a lot of material to cover, yet I am still not exactly sure what I have learned. It was hard to keep track of the material, since lectures often had nothing to do with section and the problems we had to solve in the problem sets. The preceptors - Amy and Casey - did an amazing job and were the best part of the class. Wouldn't have made it to the end without them.","LS1b has the potential to be a awesome course thanks to its cool topics and world-renowned professors. However, this is far from the case. LS1b lectures were boring, the labs terrible uninteresting, and the exams and p-sets were generally based on assumption, ambiguity, and unnecessarily strict rubrics that allowed for nothing by regurgitating exactly what was explained in lecture. The overwhelming swarm of premeds made the class less than enjoyable because they are less interested in learning than they are in getting an A. Also, don't get the textbook. The readings are often less informative than lectures and don't teach anything. Exams are only based on lectures. This is definitely the worst course I've taken at Harvard and even though I did very well, was never enjoyable.","You're going to take the class anyway. But you can rest assured that Ls1b is a fine course. There are 400 students, so it's not going to be the most personal learning experience. However, there are so many resources for you to take advantage of --Friday problem sessions with Amy and Casey, review in lab, office hours, a place to go and ask any Pset questions the night before the problem set is due--so you can definitely do well in this class and feel satisfied with your growth by the end of the semester. LS1b is getting better.","Good luck","course is poorly organized but the material is pretty interesting and it's a premed requirement.","not too difficult but does require a lot of time sometimes (especially with lab)","Its a tough class. Be prepared to put in a good amount of time, but some of it is genuinely interesting.","Such a hard class- but you have to take it","Don't take this class just for fun.","This is kind of a 'take it if you have to' class. I didn't particularly enjoy it.","The material isn't hard to understand, but the exams are.","This course may or may not kill your pre-med dreams.","Make sure to do your math carefully on tests. Grading can be  bit cruel and arbitrary.","Only take this class if it's absolutely required for you to do so.","This is a tough but rewarding class. Be prepared to work for it; you'll do well and enjoy it if you put forth the effort.","if you want to be a competent life science researcher u need to know genetics and stuff taught in this class. if you dont know this stuff youll have a hard time in upper division courses. The course staff do their best with the huge amount of information they cover in the class IMO","Although the teaching staff are brilliant and lovely people, I did not particularly enjoy this class. It was a pre-med requirement for me and nothing more.","It's really not as bad as people say. If you study and prepare well for exams, you will do well.","Life Sciences 1B is one of the most challenges courses that a freshman can take, but is taught by some of the most qualified and enthusiastic professors Harvard has to offer.","The material in this class is amazing, the organization is terrible. The lecturers themselves aren't too bad- Eggan's alright, Hoekstra and Sabeti are AMAZING, but Ruvolo kinda throws a lot of information at you without explaining it too well. You'll get through it though. However, BEWARE OF GDP. It seems like a pretty cool project when you start out, but is realistically nothing more than pointless busywork that should not be worth 10% of the grade. The professors and the Peer Study Leaders are very helpful, but do not expect much support from the preceptors\/TF's. If you're a Life Sciences concentrator you pretty much have to take this course, but don't expect much. Very disappointing overall.","This class has its strong points and downsides. Professors Hoekstra and Sabeti are phenomenal, the material they taught was fascinating and they generated a lot of enthusiasm for their topics. The material itself is very fascinating. The GDP project is great for learning about a new disease, but you will find yourself spending a lot of time following strict arbitrary guidelines. The psets and exams are graded very fairly. The lab component is not exciting, very time consuming and draining.","The information is really interesting and great but you have to go to the Friday Review Lectures. They are so helpful and apply to the problem sets. Also get to know Amy and Casey. They are very informative so take advantage of their office hours. \r\nThe exams tend to be long so the most important thing for prep to the practice problem solving and thinking of all the ways the topics can be made into questions.","It's extremely interesting, the course heads are great, especially Pardis. The head TF's aren't that supportive at times though and induce a lot of stress and anxiety.","This class was actually wonderful. Although there were definitely some drawbacks (including the GDP project which really wasn't very great at all...) I thoroughly enjoyed the class. The material was covered well in lecture, and the lecturers had a great enthusiasm for the topic. The friday lectures really made the psets doable in a timely fashion. They were great. Also, the content in the class is just amazing and very interesting. I loved LS1b!","It's a class you have to take for OEB or pre-med, so take it.","Don't take this class if you don't have to, it is a lot of work.","First of all, unless you are 100% dead set on a concentration ending in \"biology,\" do not take this course. LS1b is not required for medical schools' general biology with lab requirement. Stop reading this Q guide page and go find another course that fulfills that requirement. Or go outside or something. Literally. Stop reading. Go find a better class. Trust me, it won't be hard.\r\n\r\nOk, you're still with me? Alright. First, don't buy the book. I made that mistake, spent $200 on it at the beginning of the semester, and never opened it. You don't need the book to do well in the class, and the money could probably be better spent on alco--wait I mean wholesome and character-building diversions. In fact, you don't really need all that much to do well except a basic understanding of biology, high school math, and the clairvoyance necessary to figure out what they're asking on psets and exams. This is where the hard part comes in - it's nearly impossible sometimes to divine what exact phrasing you'll need to get credit. Compounding this fact is that, for the most part, 80% of the material being tested comes from only 20% of the lecture. You'll end up tearing your hair out Sunday night poring through lecture notes and videos to find the 15-second segment that answers your pset question. It's also very frustrating to get exams back with lots of points marked off not lots of explanation as to why; presumably, it's because the answer written didn't correspond exactly with what was on the answer key (general tip - if your class sends your exams to someone other than your TF for grading, run). Aside from the mind-reading, though, the class is frustratingly easy. It's hard to take a class seriously when you're being told by a MacArthur Fellow how to calculate simple probabilities or by a Rhodes Scholar what a log scale is. On that note, your professors will be brilliant, but only some of them (Hopi and Pardis) can really teach. So that means for half the semester, you'll have to listen to either a boring (Kevin) or - and I'm not sure how this combination is possible, but I guess it is - boring and condescending lecturer (Maryellen). The GDP project is also pretty much a disaster. It forces you to spend inordinate amounts of time searching on the internet for the answer to questions that not even real honest-to-god scientists know the answer to, plus you're being graded 95% on how good at citation you are and 5% on the laughably vague parameter of \"style.\" Oh, and each part is equal to several psets in credit, so, you know, don't screw up.\r\n\r\nSection was also pretty lackluster, and I LIKED my TF. You end up doing the same sequence of discussion\/lab week in and week out, and neither is particularly worth the repetition. The discussion - while helpful for figuring out exactly which small fraction of lecture is actually going to be tested - drags on for far too long and ends up compressing the time you have for lab. But that's okay because, in addition to not being relevant to what's being taught in lecture after the first few weeks, lab is nothing more than pipetting liquids into other liquids (sometimes they're colored--ooh!), running what seems like a million gels, and the occasional \"why am I here\" exercise, like the one where you are a \"predator\" \"hunting\" for \"prey\", aka beads in a box, constrained by the terrible and dastardly obstacle of--yup, you guessed it--turning the lights off. Really. \r\n\r\nSo, to recap: if you enjoy buying unnecessarily expensive textbooks, poorly phrased questions that don't reflect the material being taught, weirdly inexplicable grading, soporific lectures, spending lots of time with your graphing calculator, not getting to use any of the cool yet relevant functions on your graphing calculator, meaningless labs, getting to know your friendly local centrifuge, long walks on the beach, and poorly phrased questions, then LS1b may be right for you! #ohgodpleasedonttakethiscourse","You have to take it, so take it. Get a good study group going, especially with people in your dorm or a dorm close to you. I don't really see how you can do well in this course working solely on your own.","If you wade through the stuff you already know and concentrate on the stuff that's new, it's actually a pretty good course.","Great class, but it is hard work and you have to be willing to put in a strong effort.","I hated this class. It might have been because of bad preconceptions, but the problem sets were long and unnecessarily difficult, the exams were tricky in a way that I felt didn't really test whether you knew the information. The lectures were long and often quite dull. I'm still going to concentrate in a science, but not because of this class.","The material is interesting, but it's good to make sure you're prepared. I would say it is what you make it, but not going to be the best course if you're just getting it done. Most students seem to just want to get it done even though the material was interesting and you learn a lot.","This class is definitely manageable and teaches the concepts well.","Do not take this class unless you have absolutely no understanding of genomics. Opt for a higher genomics class, it will most likely be more engaging and academically fulfilling than LS1b.","This course is really what you make of it.  I have heard a lot of complaints about its lecture style, however, in the end I think the lectures were more than sufficient for learning the course material and when supplemented by very good sections and optional problem solving reviews (which I highly recommend) I felt that I learned a lot.  I would recommend taking the time to do some of the assigned reading and taking advantage of extra resources that are available, but overall a really good course.","If you are pre-med or want to concentrate in pretty much any science, you have to take this class.  Chances are, though, it will be the bane of your existence for the entire semester.  The material is interesting at times, but for the most part, it is a grind.","Although, from what I've heard, this class has drastically improved over the past couple of years, I still think that the organization of the course needs to be worked on. I think that Kevin, Hopi, and Pardis are all pretty great lecturers (Kevin can be a little condescending in his lecturing, and I think his section is the hardest one to start with), but Dr. Ruvolo is absolutely awful. I wanted to fall asleep, I couldn't pay attention in class when she lectured, and she throws around the word \"fruity\" a lot, which I found offensive. Her lecture slides also make absolutely no sense, and I don't think she explained her concepts very well.","It's hard, you'll hate it, there's a lot of work, but it's also required for almost any science concentrator  and pre-meds","Ls1b is good if you lack an understanding of basic biology principles and need a basis in genetics. Don't take it if you already understand basic genetics and are looking for something more.","Unless it it necessary for your concentration, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.","The class is okay but definitely not great. Just push through it. And watch out for the GDP Psets. Start on them early because they are time consuming!","This class is not constructed well. It will only cause you headaches. Avoid.","This class covers a very fascinating topic. Unfortunately, the academic value of the course is lost amidst the excess of tedious assignments and examinations. If exams are the focus, as reflected by the syllabus, then the other assignments should decrease in capacity so that we have time to actually prepare for them! I would have liked to focus on mastery and test taking improvements but instead I had to juggle weeks where I had a pset, GDP set, lab, and an impending exam. The other assignments were interesting but it is simply overwhelming to do them all at once without the grade being adjusted to reflect all of the work being put in. As is, this class is stressful for students who do not excel in test taking and frustrating for all who are simply interested in the material. The class has obviously improved and Casey and Amy work hard to help us out. Sadly, this great topic is blemished by the frustrating structure of the course. Very disappointed that the reviews given by my peers who had already taken the class were true. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised.","Know that most people take this course because it is a pre-med requirement. The grading is very strict. The material is very very fascinating.","The experience with LS1b is similar to LS1a in terms of learning atmosphere, student makeup, and enjoyment. Most take it as a pre-med or concentration requirement rather than out of actual interest in the course material. That being said, some of the lectures were great and enjoyable and it's an overall solid class that most interesting in the life sciences will inevitably take.","This is just one of those courses you're going to have to take if you're premed. It's hard to get around it. Overall, lecture was great and actually entertaining. I really enjoyed some of the lectures and found the material really cool. However, section\/lab ruined the course for me. Also, it is a lot of work and fairly stress-inducing. The course overall isn't that bad, but I wouldn't take it unless you are very interested in this material or premed. Don't just take it for fun.","Don't take this class unless you have to. Some units are interesting but overall it is dry material.","I was not excited to enroll into this course but I ended up enjoying it a lot. The material is much more interesting than LS1a and the teaching staff does a good job for the most part. The workload and difficulty are similar to LS1a, but the course staff does a good job of showing how concepts apply outside of the classroom, and there are many resources to help students clear up confusion and get practice on problems. Professors Hoekstra and Sabeti are the best lecturers and they both went into extremely interesting topics. However, the labs in this course are very repetitive and eat up a lot of time, even though they are basically the same techniques being used every week. Overall though, I thought this was a good course that is very applicable and gives a deeper appreciation for genetics.","Genetics is a fascinating topic but the course does not always present information in the most fascinating way.","requires many hours a week","its an interesting class but be prepared for some tough problem sets","This class has a terrible grading rubrik for all my assignments.","Take it if you have to by concentration requirements. If you've taken AP bio, this is a waste of time. You can learn everything on your own in two days.","This class has many interesting components including fascinating lecturers and powerful opportunities to hear for specialists and patients in several different genetic disorders. The other components of the course are fairly standard for an intro level course.","This is a pretty decent class as far as pre-med requirements go. I really liked it more than LS1A, if you like biology and genetics then you will find the course material really interesting --because it is.","This course is an intro class so it is necessary to take. The lecturers are good and the material is interesting. The class feels very impersonal, though, and I found it difficult to get help. Also, understanding material and enjoying the section component is very dependent on the particular teaching fellow you get.","If you are not a premed and do not have a firm passion for research, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is waste of your time. But what you could learn from this class is that you don't want to pursue science. The people who interact and be taught will give a sense whether you want to work in this area. For me what I generally felt was a group of arrogant people who believe they know everything. Also the head Tf is very not accessible and somewhat very aggressive and unhelpful. But know that she is available for the formality of it. So if you do your best to get her attention, you can do okay for the class. I didn't feel the need because I do not want to go for medicine and research. Thank you for this good learning experience I think I will never regret this decision in my life.","I think this course is a decent intro-level biology course, however, most of the time it felt extremely disorganized and cluttered. Tests were not very indicative of material that was learned, and often asked for paragraph answers but seemed to only be looking for one specific term or word instead. The GDP project was interesting, but the lack of a rubric made it extremely difficult as you could obtain a variety of information from anywhere on the world wide web. The class also had a very weird timeline as they assigned problem sets and labs during awkward times like reading period when you have a variety of other finals to work on. However the material presented was interesting and the class itself is very good! I would recommend you also look into higher level biology classes that may be a bit harder but may be more manageable or beneficial in the end!","LS1b is a good course, but not a wonderful course. You will definitely learn some interesting genetics, and while the assignments can be tedious LS1b is a good addition to one's biology education. Read the textbook if you can, it adds to the course experience immensely and if I hadn't had two other science classes that took up tons of time I would have read more diligently. LS1b is not particularly challenging, and can seem like it is directed at a pre-college audience at times. At the end of the day, however, it is a positive experience. There is a sad truth that the final unit of LS1b is significantly worse than the other three, so as we all go into these evaluations we have a little bit of a bad taste in our mouths. But we must remember that LS1b had many great moments. All the professors are wonderful, and the first three are also great lecturers. Hopi and Pardis are special standouts. Maryellen is a great person, but here lectures this year were a little bit more of a fact-dump than real, engaging lectures. LS1b has a slight culture of pre-med grade craziness, which I personally found tragic but this is far from LS1b's fault. Pre-meds, please, if you don't actually care about biology then maybe medicine isn't the best career for you. Doctors are wonderful people, dedicated to caring and a better world; one would think that doctors, of all people, would see that there is more to life than grades. Anyway, LS1b is a great class. Take it, since you probably have to, enjoy the good parts (and there are many), waltz through the dreary parts with a smile on your face, and read the textbook to realize that biology might be cooler than you thought.","You gotta take it for requirements and it won't be easy but at least you forge camaraderie with other pre-meds.","Don't tale this course unless you have to.","Hopi and Pardis are good lecturers, while the other two were meh. Definitely did not make me as enthusiastic about genetics as I could have been.","If you're concentrating in biology, you have to take it, so take it sooner rather than later. It's a perfectly fine class, and there were some really cool lectures.","There's a lot of information, but the Friday Review sessions are amazing and so helpful in giving you an idea of what you need to know for the class. I would definitely suggest going to those. The Head TFs, Casey and Amy, are amazing at explaining material. This class isn't as painful as some people may say.","While LS1B is getting better, it is still not a great class. While some material can be interesting, it covers way to much stuff, in too little time, and then unfairly assesses you on the material by asking very specific topics on concepts you barely went over. It might be because the class is just to big, but it is the epitome of an introductory class. If you take it, it is because you have to, so there is no choice, but try to come in with an open mind. It is very easy to hop on the LS1B hate wagon, but that is only going to cause you more stress down the road, so stay positive.","The material itself is interesting in my opinion, and the professors are all great, incredibly intelligent people who really care about the course and want you to do well. I learned things that will probably be very helpful in later\/other related courses. That said, it's just not an enjoyable class. Probably best not to take it if you don't have to.","It's a tough class, but many of you must take it so stay positive, make the most of it and don't be afraid to ask for and seek help.","Ls1b is great! I really like genetics and genetic engineering, and this class introduced me to a lot of fun concepts! The multiple professors is also fun, as you get a varied exposure to different work different professors are doing.","If you're a pre-med or biology concentrator, take this class--otherwise it's not worth your time.","A lot of people complain about LS 1b, but it was actually one of my favorite classes this semester (and I wasn't expecting it to be). A broad range of topics are covered, which was very helpful for me because I knew I wanted to concentrate in one of the life sciences, but this allowed me to determine which particular subjects I was most interested in. You get four different lecturers for six lectures each, and each has their own particular style so if you don't like one as much, you'll be moving on to the next one in a few lectures anyway. All of the teaching staff and extra resources, such as the Friday problem solving lectures were very helpful, though I didn't feel the need to go to them all that often, and I didn't use the textbook at all. Section was enjoyable because I had a great TF, but I know others who weren't as fortunate, and it was a bit disjointed from week to week and skipped around a lot. Overall though, if you're at all interested in biology, definitely take this class!!","Really consider if you want to take the class. The tests are difficult, and the GDP is time consuming, graded harshly, and feels more pointless than integrated with the rest of the course.","It's not the best run course. Its status as bio concentration\/premed requirement makes it a messy cobbling together of all the things they don't teach you in LS1a\/LPSA that they still need to fit in. Some professor's modules are better than others\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSabeti's was especially good in comparison to the others.","Frustrating but fine.","The preceptors are really great and the problem solving lectures are probably the most helpful component of the course. The section\/lab component is really painful. The labs seem unnecessary and some tfs seem to believe that they need to fill up the whole 3 hours even if there isn't that much material. Also, it's basically impossible to get an A in the course unless you're getting 93 and up on the midterms, which is not an easy feat. oh and the genetic disorder project is completely miserable. I mean, like, really really miserable. It's worth 10% of your grade and graded very harshly.","Do practice problems. PSLs are quality and helpful for psets","It's a decent class overall. Sometimes it's hard to sit through but you learn a lot.","This course starts strong and finishes weaker. Professors Eggan and Hoekstra give informative and interesting lectures, while Professor Sabeti--while hard to follow in lecture--gives clear notes and follow-up summaries which make her information quite manageable. Professor Ruvolo's material is disorganized and it is unclear what you have to know and what is extraneous--just learn everything on her slides. Anything might be on the exam. Overall, though, this course gives a solid foundation of genetics and you really end up learning the material. I was glad this course was not a superficial overview, but really allowed me to \"get into\" the material on a deeper level.","The quality of the course largely depends on the lecturer and your TF. Kevin does an okay job of presenting the material but can be condescending. Hopi is great and entertaining; she also always interacts with students. Pardis is somewhat awkward but an okay teacher. She tried to teach way too much material at first but is receptive to students' feedback. Maryellen is just boring and completely unengaging. I was totally lost during some of her lectures. You should definitely take advantage of Amy's office hours - she's so helpful and caring. She's always willing to stay late to make sure you get the material. On the other hand, you should avoid Casey as much as possible. She is the exact opposite of Amy and is downright cold and callous. She tries to trip you up on exams and is very passive aggressive.","Do not take this unless you absolutely have to","It's very difficult and requires a strong science background.","This class teaches you a lot, and the material covered is interesting. The lectures are good, but there is a fair amount of work associated with this course.","This is going to be horrible, and strong odds are that you will not enjoy this course - but you have to take this, so stick it through. Be prepared for poorly worded assignments, exams, and labs, and general uncertainty over exactly what you're supposed to know. Pardis Sabeti's unit is the only saving grace.","I honestly would not recommend this class to anyone who does not either have to take it to graduate or for premed requirements. There is little benefit other than a huge headache. Do not expect the quality of LS1a (I cannot speak for LPSa).","The course is fine. It can be a little difficult to find out what they actually want you to know for exams, etc. but if you poke around on the course site you can generally find some useful tips.","People were extremely competitive in this class, so that it almost felt hostile sometimes-- that's the fault of a bunch of GPA-obsessed pre-med students, not the professors. If you have any serious interest in science, it's a great window to seeing the modern developments in science and putting past knowledge in perspective, but it does require some dedication that non-science people may not be interested in.","LS1b is just another introductory course you need to get through. If you're not sure if you're interested in science, it also is a good survey course to see if the topic intrigues you at all.","There is a lot of work for this class. The material itself is interesting, but the lectures can get tedious.","This course is a good way to learn more about molecular genetics. It is useful for understanding the genetic basis of disease.","The material is amazing. I really found that I loved learning about biology, which I was sort of not sure about before. I think Pardis especially made me really interested in genomics. I loved learning about all the different methods used as well. Overall, it was an engaging course.","take it only if you have to","Despite the cries of some, this is a very enjoyable class! Overall, I loved learning the material the professors lectured about, and they cover a lot of different topics, so the course is very dynamic! The difficulty of this class depends on how much of a biology background you have, but as long as you stay on top of your work and understanding the material in general, you will have a great experience.","Ls1b is a necessary course for most science concentrations but it is not a very well structured course at all.","LS1b is a course that has so much potential to be a great class but never really fits the bill. The concepts are interesting, and labs where we work with our own DNA to find out about ourselves were pretty fun. Just be prepared to struggle through the work - in no way is this course a breeze. It's so much to understand and not enough time. Testing is not easy either. \r\n\r\nThat said, shop this course because it is indeed interesting and it opened my eyes to a whole world of science and controversy that I've never before considered. If you focus on the material and the knowledge, you will find what you learn amazing and enjoyable. Like I said, the topic is amazing, but the course is just not run in the best way possible.","This class is easy, but it's poorly organized and I sometimes question if I was using my resources properly in taking this course. It's very soft and glosses over topics that I wished were covered more in detail. The grading rubrics are ridiculously strict to the point where you could be losing points, even in writing the correct answer, just because you left out a few words. However, I've heard LS1b is the least interesting and engaging of the bio classes, so don't let this class be the end all if you are considering biology, chemistry, pre-med, etc.","If you got an A in LS1a, don't take this class. If you think you're good at biology, don't take this class. It is way too easy and you'll be bored for the whole semester. You don't need this for Pre-Med requirements! You can take a different bio course! Also, don't buy the book, you won't ever read it.","I used to be premed before this course. The tests are not reflective of the lectures. But take it to convince you to not be a science major anymore.","The class tries to accomplish too much, it has apparently become better in past years but the material in lecture is not really related to the labs and the tests are rather hard. As for the reading, they assign a huge amount that was not really useful so i know many chose not to do any, perhaps if they cut down their suggested reading to only material that is relevant to the course material. The GDP is a project that looks good on paper but is a waste of time that is graded harshly and counts for a large part of your grade.","You should only take LS1b if you absolutely have to.  If your concentration requires it, power through and know that other courses will be better.  If you are not required to take LS1b, don't.","It's a necessary evil in the life-sciences pathway, but if you have a great TF and stay on top of the material, which isn't that difficult to do, you'll be fine. I found this material much more interesting that what was covered in LS1a, especially the modules taught by Professor Hoekstra and Professor Sabeti. It's also nice that there are 3 midterms, enabling you to test yourself more frequently throughout the term instead of only twice.","Lots of work!!","I would tell them that most people really dislike this class, but I really enjoyed it (which was pretty dependent on my TF).","Worth taking because the material is relevant but not the most interesting class. Some of the professors are better at lectures than others, but if you know the concepts on the concept checks online and are able to do the problem sets, you should be fine. The exams are doable with all the practice problems given.","LS1b is much more interesting than LS1a, but administered much more poorly. The psets are vague, it's often unclear what they want on exams. Prof. Hokstra and Prof. Sabeti are great, but Prof. Eggan is cursed with boring material and Prof. Ruevelo makes her really interesting material hard to follow. This class has a preponderance of very driven people, so you have to work hard not to stress out about it, because in actuality it's not that hard.","You learn important things in this class, but it's not easy at all. Be prepared to put in a lot of effort to get a good grade, including a lot of memorizing.","An interesting course taught in an uninteresting way. Weekly workload is not bad at all, but exams can be tough (other than Unit 3, which was a breeze).","You can know the material for this class, and even enjoy the material, but still get a terrible grade.","Unless you have to take this course as a concentration\/pre-med requirement, STAY AWAY. The material was interesting and some of the lecturers were effective, but the way the class was graded (only 7% for problem sets... REALLY?) is ridiculous and a huge turn-off. LS 1b is the worst class I've taken at Harvard thus far.","Tests are graded extremely subjectively and your grade does not always reflect the amount of time you put into the class.","Ls1b is strictly for a pre-med requirement. It is somewhat interesting material and isnt as hard or horrible as everyone says. The teachers take the class too seriously and give assignments out like t hey have to. As long as you do the practice you should be fine.","The class felt very disorganized and most of the lectures had an abnormal pace. Although the material was interesting, the way in which the class was conducted took away from this. There are a lot of little assignments, but the material isn't very hard in general (it's often unclear though what is expected of you).","Not as bad as people say! I enjoyed the subjects we covered. Sometimes it feels like you're jumping through hoops with all the assignments they give, but 99% are very helpful for learning the material.","It's obviously a premed heavy class and that ruins it. The class becomes about jumping through the hoops to do well rather than actually learning.","This class covers a lot of interesting material and introduces you to many interesting genetic analysis lab techniques, but it is structured very poorly, so that in the end you're not entirely sure what the overall take-home message is, which can be frustrating and make you want to quit the class if not being premed too. (I probably would've considered quitting premed if my section hadn't been full of such great people.) In the end, I would recommend taking it only if you are premed and it is a requirement.","Do the readings! And don't be afraid to ask the preceptors and professors for help!!","This course is one of the courses you just need to push through. parts of it suck, others not so much. I didn't have a horror story from this class but I didn't have a great time either. I wouldn't say I'm the smartest guy at harvard and I think I did fairly all right in this class.","I learned a great deal of interesting information in this course. It is a genetics course from beginning to end - not really an introduction to biology. If you are interested in genetics, try this course. It is a very time-consuming and work-intensive course with difficult problem sets and weekly lab sections. But I'm happy I took it.","its a very cool class but you have to work a lot for it and keep on top of things. if you don't it shows very easily","This class is great if you want to learn about genetics. That being said, it's not really a course you want to take just because you HAVE to. You need to enjoy it, too.","not as bad as people say, but take it expecting to be annoyed with it and do a lot of the heavy-lifting yourself.  it can be fun though and it's a bonding experience","Very interesting class that always felt very relevant. The material was great and the workload was manageable. It far exceeded the reputation it had coming in.","Enjoyed the course content a lot, somewhat of a time intensive class","This course turned out to be a lot better than I expected. I actually enjoyed Pardis and Hopi's lectures greatly. Even Kevin and Maryellen had relatively interesting lectures. This course, did involve quite a bit of work, and some weeks were especially work-heavy for no apparent reason. Overall, if you do have to take it as a concentration requirement, it turns out not to be too bad! I liked the course overall, but I know many others didn't.","Take it only to get rid of your Pre-Med\/concentration requirement.","The material is interesting and you should do the readings before going to lecture, and pay attention when your TF goes through practice problems in section","Don't take this class.  It will be one of your biggest regrets.","I think that the material and the intent of the class are great--the course just lacks organization and efficacy at times. If all the lecturers were like Pardis Sabeti I would recommend the class with much more enthusiasm!","Prepare to be bored out of your skulls. It is very easy to learn the material outside of lecture, they overcomplicate the calculations in lecture.","Exams are unfair, Ruvolo is terrible. Everyone else is great however","It's really just a basic requirement, not a very fun topic depending on where your interests lie but it certainly forms a fundamental base for moving forward with any science involving the human body.","Some units were better than others but overall it was very interesting and you will learn a lot about several different areas of organismal and evolutionary biology.","It was challenging, but worth it. It makes you think and actually work hard--but if you buy into it, you will learn a lot and be a smarter person leaving.","Honestly, what everyone says about LS1b is a bit overhyped. If you keep a level head and study diligently you should be a bit better off. Don't be disheartened by the incongruous assignments, the illogical grading standards, and conflicting information you will inevitably be presented with in this course. Yes, it's unfair. Yes, it's a requirement. No, you should not let this course discourage you from biology at Harvard.","This class was actually pretty interesting, and they've been working to improve this class every year. Many of the topics covered were interesting, such as quantitative genomics and deviations from normal Mendelian inheritance. However, the class is a bureaucracy and lab\/section takes a good chunk of time, there are clicker questions, and the GDP project is a huge pain.","If there is any possible alternative to this class I would strongly encourage a future student to take that alternative option instead. I would NOT recommend this class.","This course effectively exposes you to genetics, genomics, and evolution.","It is a pain but you will get through it.","If you are taking this class, it's probably because you have to. Not to disappoint you, but this class is no one's favorite.  This is just one of those classes you have to grit through and deal with it.  Some sections of material are much more enjoyable than others, but this class just is what it is.","If you're looking into this course, you probably have to take it, so nothing on the Q will convince you otherwise.  If you're trying to fulfill an elective, look elsewhere.  This class will take too much of your time for merely a gen ed req.","I would only recommend this class if you HAVE to take it. It's a bitch, in every way possible, but you just have to get through it. Psets are hard, tests are graded harshly, and GDP is a waste of time, but you just have to get through.","Unless the course gets better lecture wise, I would tell my friends to only take the class only if it is necessary.","This is a challenging class. Although the lessons are taught well and there is plenty of help available if needed, the midterms and final exam are difficult. You may not do as well as you may like in this class, regardless of putting enough time\/effort into it.","The class was terrible.  Unless you need to take it, DON'T.  Literally any other genetics course will teach this material to you better and will be infinitely more enjoyable.  Lectures were three times as long as they needed to be and the assessments are insulting.  Your performance in the class is independent of how well you learn the material.  Honestly, you have to test mindless.  Just memorize the answers they give you and regurgitate them.","I was wary of the course before taking it (I had heard the previous horror stories about this class) but I was really surprised to see how well organized the course was.  Most of the lecturers were extremely engaging and focused, and the psets followed the lectures for the most part.  The only issues I had were with the 4th section of the course, which seemed less focused and the psets had questions that were barely covered or mentioned only briefly in lecture, but the other 3 sections were very clear.  There are many resources for students, and while a certain amount of effort needs to be put in, it's very possible to do well in this course.  Special shout out to Professor Sabeti, who obviously cared so much about her students (she was the only professor who held multiple review sections before the midterm for her section, emailed the students before the exams, etc.)","Of all the required courses, this one is pretty great. I thought I'd find a lot of the material boring, but it was actually really interesting and exciting, so go into it with an open mind!  \r\n\r\nDefinitely take advantage of the Friday Problem Solving Reviews!!! The preceptors present the information in new ways and organize it differently, so it solidifies your understanding of the concepts. And one of the biggest things you can do in a class like this is get good at solving the problems, which the PSRs are aimed to do.  And you'll be REALLY glad you have the PSR notes when it comes to studying for the midterms and final.","if you have any hesitation about taking this class, I'd suggest you not take it. it is absolutely terrible. when I first took it, I thought I would grind my teeth through it because \"it can't be THAT bad!\" This was probably one of the worst decisions of my freshman year.","I thought that the subject matter was really interesting. If you are interested in genetics and evolution, then this is a great class for you. The lectures were really interesting and engaging, and the professors tried really hard to make them easy to understand. I really enjoyed this class!","This is a great class. The lectures are exciting, and it's a much more relatable field than what was covered in ls1a.","I approached this class in the wrong way. Honestly it is not that difficult. You need to go to PSL's those are the most helpful thing, and really understand the problem sets. I wish I could redo this course because i came in thinking it was going to be impossible, but it really isn't. Pardis's lectures were the clearest in what actually showed up on the test, but Hopi's were most interesting.","The class is a lot of busy work, lecture isn't particularly informative or helpful, and lab is generally a waste time.","Unless you absolutely have to take this course, avoid it. There is a lot of busy work, psets are easy but exams are hard, there's a lot of material and it's not filtered well, hard work in this class is not rewarded","For being basically a requirement for all premed or life science concentrators, this class is actually really great. The material is very interesting and presented in such a way that all the units relate and build upon one another. There is only one pset a week, and they aren't too bad. Labs are actually really interesting and fun to do, and they relate to the material in class.","This class is hard in that for certain assignments, you need to know exactly what they are looking for to get the questions right.","Make sure to pay attention during lecture and be engaged.","I would tell them to be prepared to donate many hours of their week to doing lengthy psets and trying to understand the class material, because oftentimes the lectures are unclear.","Its a lot to deal with. There are many components that go into your grade and the ones that you spend most time on dont even count for much (like psets). Its a stressful class (and all the premeds dont help)","If you want to take this course, be prepared to study a lot and try to go to as many office hours as you can.","Good luck - I am sorry if you have to take this course. If you don't have to take it then DON'T. It is the worst class I (and everyone else) have ever taken at Harvard.","Sadly, this class is required for almost every life science requirement. DO NOT take this course if you don't have to. Too many people, the class takes itself way too seriously, and it's organized in a way that doesn't give students a break. Also the Genetic Disorder Project is a completely useless exercise that I would expect from a lousy high school class, not a college course.","It is very interesting but tedious, and an unnecessary amount of work.","You've got to take it, so just get through. Try to find what you find interesting to carry you through as certain things you certainly wont enjoy but don't let that discourage you.","Overall, I liked this class. I know that LS1b is notorious for being bad, but I think actively trying to avoid the mindset of \"this class sucks\" can make the experience far less painful. Most of the material is interesting and, in my opinion, well organized, with the exception of the last section (Dr. Ruvolo's section). Her material was interesting but not very well-structured and it differs from the rest of the course in that it's not so much a matter of understanding but more that you have to straight up memorize the information. The material as a whole was fascinating in my opinion and as long as you keep up with the material and make sure you understand the PSETs it's not that difficult. I would recommend going to office hours because the professors are pretty friendly and help clear up misunderstandings with the material.","Be prepared to struggle\/be bored at times. The lectures, especially the last few, are very boring and move quickly which is a shame considering the material is interesting","LS1b is a really fantastic course. The teaching staff is wonderful, most especially because they are so dedicated to the course.  All of the material is fascinating; rather than dissuade me from being pre-med, this course reaffirmed why I want to be a doctor. LS1b provides a really great overview of the field of genetics and the current research being done. It is a significant time commitment in terms of class time, but nothing is ever unmanageable. Exams and assignments are fair, help is always available in the form of office hours and problem solving lectures, and workload is relatively light throughout the semester (problem sets only take about 2 hours).","This course starts off easy but gets progressively harder. Make sure you stay on track with the work and don't feel like you know all the material entering the class because it starts with basic meiosis and mitosis concepts.","This class is hard, but you will learn a lot after taking it.","LS1b is definitely not that bad. I would go to the PSL sessions and look over the problem solving sessions if you need help with lecture material. They definitely have the resources to help you do well if you want to. Also, don't read the book - you don't need to at all to understand the material. Actually, always go to the problem solving sessions if you want to do well on the midterms!! Amy and Casey explain things really well.","People like to complain about this class a lot, but it's really not bad at all. It's only annoying\/frustrating if you let yourself into that mindset before giving it your best shot.","Take it early if you can and get it out of the way. It's not difficult but it will require a good amount of self motivation on your part.","This course, while serving its purpose as a primer to genetics, is terribly managed, disorganized, and asks too much of its students between 3-hour unproductive labs and hyper-frequent assignments.","You have to take it for most science concentrations, so it makes sense to get it out of the way early.","Avoid this class by all means. It is, by far, the very worst course I've ever taken in my life. There is no organization or structure, and assignments are graded solely on use of buzzwords. Terrible class.","Unless the course is a requirement, and unavoidable, I would not recommend","Although the material of the class is interesting, it is not well organized.","Only take this class if you need to. If you're premed but not concentrating in a life science, take another class to fulfill your requirements. Some of the professors were just there to teach and didn't care about their students at all.","The topics covered in this class were very interesting, and overall I enjoyed my time in the class. It is certainly not a painless class, but it has definitely improved from years past, and I feel like I got a great deal out of it.","This class was horrible but there is no alternative to taking it if you want to continue in the sciences.","If you're interested in genetics, this class does a good job of covering a lot of different aspects of the topic. They also put some emphasis on statistical methods of analyzing data which I thought was interesting and helpful.","You have to do it as a requirement.","There is a lot of work that goes into this class. You really need to pay attention in class and find a good group to work on psets with. You also need to to start studying for midterms several days in advance. But the sections are good, especially if you have a good TF (like Tamsin). The course itself is very interesting, and I'm glad I took it.","There's a lot of work for this course and it sucks, but if you're doing one of the life sciences you have to do it anyways. It's gonna suck but it's just one of those things.","Beware the premeds!!!","If you are currently reading this message, that means you are considering this class. Let me tell you: if you know for a CERTAINTY that you do NOT have to take this class, RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION. If you HAVE to take this class, I'm sorry.","It's a great class and a very enjoyable course if you put int he effort and keep up. It's basically what you make it to be.","You're pretty much screwed because this is the main way to get your pre-med requirements and it's required for some concentrations. If you can find another class though, I would take it.","Only take this class if you need to for your concentration. It is your basic intro science class-- pretty large and frustrating. Professors Hoekstra and Sabeti give this class an upside, but other than them it can be rough to get through.","Ls 1b is a fluctuating class so it's bound to change by the time you read this. What I can tell you is that the class actually does teach a good amount of basic genetics and genomic methods that are extremely useful to the budding biologist (yeah, I just said 'budding biologist'. Ugh). Dr. Sabeti is the best lecturer in this class, but the constant changing between teachers and teaching styles will be bound to confuse you. Also, the GDP is awful and overall if they keep three midterms you will hate the amount of week-to-week work you'll do in this class, but it's a bit of a necessary evil. It is what it is, and if you focus on the useful stuff you'll learn, you'll get a lot more out of this class.","You have to take this class if you're premed unless you want to take MCB52, which is supposed to be pretty rough.  But unless you're in this situation don't.  You're likely to spend a lot of time frustrated at grading and not quite sure what you're supposed to be studying, and not a lot of time feeling like you're actually building a foundation of knowledge.","This course is a requirement for most science concentrations, but you probably won't like taking it that much at all. The lectures are not interesting and the first two sections are incredibly micro- focused.","I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot.  That being said, the course is a lot of work.  There are a lot of assignments, some of them quite time consuming.  The exams require a lot of prep.","The material made this class my favorite but how it was taught prevents me from recommending it with enthusiasm.","The material was very interesting and the problem sets were manageable.  However, the exams were very difficult and graded tough.","Boring class that has some good professors and some bad professors.","This class needs to changed once again, and once it is it will be better.","If you are not interested in taking a poorly organized class with attendance of up to a couple hundred, then this class may be a struggle. Otherwise, if you are genuinely interested in learning the course material and would like to listen to lectures on big-name professors, even if teaching is not their forte, this would be an enjoyable class.","The professors are pretty good and interesting, but the section leaders vary greatly.","Don't take this unless literally forced. Worst class pretty much ever. Made me hate science. Forcefully strayed me away from science and premed and everything. Maryellen Ruvolo is a patronizing old fashioned woman who didn't actually teach methods. Sabeti was great and was the only tiny saving grace of the class. But the class was not saved. Awful. SOS.","Covers some of the most interesting topics in biology.","I wanted to like this class.  The content isn't inherently boring.  The professors are accomplished- outside of the lecture hall.  But if you thought Ls1a was bad, be prepared for a class that will have you on your knees begging for Rob Lue to come back and lecture just once.  The professors are nice people, but three out of four of them CANNOT LECTURE.  Exams and problem sets are poorly worded (literally one question on a problem set was \"What are two differences between humans and chimpanzees?\" No further directions given).  Little content is actually learned, and exams are graded so that you only get credit if you give the answer they want rather than any correct answer with a scientific basis.  STAY AWAY from this course unless you absolutely have to take this passion-crushing class.  If I weren't also enrolled in a far better taught and far more interesting organic chemistry class (Chem 20), I might have left the sciences because of this class.","Very interesting material and professors,  but requires improvement in terms of wording on problem sets and exams.","Its alright. Better than ls1b, not too hard but not super easy, A lot of busywork","LS1b is absolutely amazing, and I recommend 100% that you take this class if you have any interest in Genetics\/Biology in general. The teaching staff is absolutely amazing and the preceptors are very helpful and always available for help. After LS1a I had decided life sciences as a concentration was not for me, and this course absolutely brought me back. The subject material is interesting and relevant, and the professors do an amazing job of generating excitement for the material. Upperclassmen who took the course multiple years ago likely had a very different experience than one presented here, so if you hear that don't let it dissuade you from taking the class; it has been absolutely fantastic this year.","Eggan, Hoekstra, and Sabeti were the most engaging teachers ever, especially Hoekstra--I really enjoyed going to lecture.","This course is REALLY cool. Better than lpsa or ls1a.  Good introduction to how all the molecular biology can be applied to the real world and evolution.","Don't waste time with the textbook or the readings - they may be interesting but there is so much content in this course that your time is better spent revising material and trying to keep up","Not a bad class. Definitely not everything that people make it out to be. It's filled with premeds so you know what's coming. Lectures can be drawn out and boring but Eggan and Hoekstra are interesting. Sabeti tries to keep your interest by launching projectiles into the lecture hall. Bottom line: you are probably required to take it. Bite the bullet.","Very annoying class. Hoekstra and Sabeti's sections are great, but they're unique in that compared to the other two sections. Some sections are unclear, and at times the workload will feel like a bit too much (especially when you have psets due while you're studying for a test). Go to as my PSLs as you can or watch the videos online. Staying on top of practice problems every week rather than doing them all before a test is the best way to go.","Not as bad as everyone says it is; it definitely requires hard work, but personally I think the material that you learn is very interesting. Don't come in with a negative mindset. Go to office hours if you need it.","Don't take it unless you have to. Go to office hours.","It's not as bad as people make it seem.","Time intensive class. Lecture component is iffy, material taught and application is incredible.","This class is really large and taught in lecture-style, which is often difficult to engage with and can feel impersonal. I would suggest getting to know the teaching staff well in order to make your experience in the class more personal, by attending problem solving sessions and office hours.","Although this course is a pre-med requirement, it is just not worth it. There were a few parts in which I feel like I truly learned interesting techniques for solving problems, such as in Unit 3, but overall the course was a lot of heartache, wasted effort and regret. If you do take the course, plan on waiting until sophomore year so you can weigh the decision carefully. I recommend PS 1 or PS 11 for your freshman year. I was not prepared for the course because I didn't have a strong background in Biology in high school, so you'll also want to think about that.","The class is pretty dry and the work is rather painful. It is ineffectively taught and content is crammed in.","It's pretty interesting, but they don't care about you or your time. Prepare for a terrible 3 hour weekly lab and numerous assignments in reading period.","If you have to take it, take it, it's not the worst class. If you are choosing to take it look for a different class that might be more interesting.","I think the course was pretty much like what you expect from a survey science class. Some of the content is boring, but they do a reasonable job of making it engaging.","This class is interesting but very unstructured and not the most well taught","This class is a good course, but at times it felt like more of a genetics statistics course than more of the biology behind genetics.","This class is tricky.  On exams and psets, you must have what the exactly what the answer key has as your answer, or it will be marked wrong.  I.E. no \"mostly right\" variation.  However, the material is enjoyable and timely.  I suggest the class because the material is worth it, but the grading is unfair."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.90","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"2.90","enrollment":"431","response rate":"78.65","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LIFESCI 1b","course_id":"2767","cat_num":"2159","1s":"34","2s":"76","3s":"119","4s":"71","5s":"16"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LIFESCI 1b","course_id":"2767","cat_num":"2159","1s":"4","2s":"21","3s":"133","4s":"115","5s":"41"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LIFESCI 1b","course_id":"2767","cat_num":"2159","1s":"19","2s":"161","3s":"96","4s":"27","5s":"11"}},"success":true}
