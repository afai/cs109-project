Does anyone care? Do you want to know? Then join the conversation. People have struggled with the same ideas you have since they have started writing. True, reading may be difficult, but with the help of multiple professors and a great section led by one of them, the minimum you can achieve in this course is more than enough to help you realize that you are not alone in the struggle of living. If you're hesitating, dare to take up the challenge and strive to seek for truth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don't worry, it has a happy ending!","Take this class. It's definitely a lot of reading, but you'll form a certain bond with the people in your section because you've struggled through the same books. Aside from the people in your section, the amazing professors definitely make the course. They generate so much enthusiasm for the texts and are so accessible to talk with you about your reactions to the book or anything else. I loved my section because my professor let us determine what elements of the book we wanted to talk about, and he would ask guiding questions to help us make connections between them. We also wrote weekly responses online where we'd respond to both the book and to each other. The section TF would provide really in-depth feedback to these responses which really helped improve my writing when it came down to completing the essays. Coming from a non-humanities concentrator, I thought the course was amazing and helped me become a better reader and writer. If you don't resist what all this course has to offer but jump in with both feet, the readings, responses and section discussions will become the highlight of your week.","Be aware that it's a lot of reading and the grading is not fair.","Incredible lectures, office hours- take advantage of office hours and lunches.","This class is really hard but worth it if you put the work in. I stopped being able to do all of the reading towards the end, so it became an exercise in reading and writing about summaries, and sections were hard to participate in.","Take this course, especially if you haven't read these books (they are fantastic), but if only to have the chance to get to know some amazing scholars.","I would recommend this class with enthusiasm to those willing to really put in the hours to read and think about one substantial work a week. If you are willing to put in this effort, the professors and texts are worth it!","This course was by far the best of my freshman fall.  It was consistently interesting and engaging, and truly was the kind of course Harvard likes to flaunt--working with and learning from a true faculty member with a serious pedigree.  I would recommend to anyone, regardless of interests.  This seems like it could be a flagship course for the University--the humanities' response to CS50.","This course will involve a significant amount of work to adequately comprehend the material.  Be prepared to spend quite a lot of time devoted to that.","Hum10 is an incredible course if you have genuine interest in the humanities - either as a concentration or just in general. It takes a lot of time and effort, but can be truly rewarding and inspiring if you are committed. The professors are passionate and really care about your experience - they want you to love the texts each week and therefore really make them come alive in lecture. Harvard seems to have pulled together some of its best to run this class. That said, if you don't put in the effort, this class will likely move too quickly and broadly for you to really appreciate what you're learning. You cover many millenia-- you have to be paying attention to see how it all connects together. Professors are highly accessible outside of class and their office hours definitely had the highest attendance of any I've encountered. My TF (Taylor) was also excellent in making me feel comfortable and really pushing me to think further and more carefully about all my ideas and assumptions. One negative component to this class was a sense of competitiveness-perhaps this is just a general Harvard phenomenon, but in section it often felt like people were just trying to show off for the benefit of the professor and the other students. Section was not the free and thoughtful opportunity it might have been. In general, I would definitely recommend this class if you have a general interest in the humanities, a desire to gain a very broad sense of the Western tradition, and a real commitment to pushing yourself hard each week.","The reading is manageable and the faculty is great.  Fantastic course for freshman who admire the common core at other schools.","Do not take this course if you have any other life outside of sitting in a library reading.  I am extremely interested in these works and think that there is an incredibly better way to tackle them.  I felt like I could not actually engage with any of these texts and that it was a waste of time to take this course rather than just reading them on my own.  There wasn't much I got out of this course that made it better than having just done my own reading.   The teaching support is great but it is hard to do this class if you don't have all your time to dedicate to this course.","This course is an invaluable opportunity to interact with some of Harvard's most distinguished humanities professors, in particular, Professor Menand and Professor Greenblatt, who spearhead the class. Be prepared to read quite a bit, and to be challenged by the material. Elizabeth Phillips, at least, is a wonderful TF who is easy to reach and provides effective feedback on writing. It's important to go into section with the knowledge that the texts you're studying are complicated, and can hardly be absorbed in the week you're given to read them. As such, section is a time to explore your perhaps vague ideas and to get as good an understanding as you can in such short time. Go to as many class excursions as possible!","Lectures are amazing, as is the access in section to each of the professors.  Essays are hard, as well as the huge task of keeping up with the reading every week.","During the very first lecture for Hum 10a, Professor Greenblatt spoke mystically about the earliest form of artwork-- hand paintings etched in the French Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave.  Our ancestors wanted to create, to transcend the ephemeral through their creations. \n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, he asked.\n\nTake this course because you are interested in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Because you are interested in gaining a more nuanced appreciation of art and its centrality to human existence.\n\nHum 10a not an easy A; there is much reading, writing, and the professors\/TF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have high standards. \n\nThrough Hum 10a, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve engaged with multiple answers to the question of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why?.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Through Professor Roilos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture on the Symposium, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to appreciate the various Forms; we are all climbing the Ladder of Love, yet occupy different rungs. Through Professor Greenblatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture on Hamlet, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to appreciate Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emphasis on the character\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior; thoughts can supplant plot in a story. Through Professor Simmons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture on Descartes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to appreciate the relationship between the mind and body; is the soul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence contingent upon the physical? Through Professor Menand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture on Rousseau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Confessions, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to appreciate the vulnerability evident in an autobiography--the vulnerability needed to respect the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153integrity of nature.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Through Professor Claybaugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture on Jane Austen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of free indirect discourse, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to appreciate the novel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions to making the interior accessible to audiences rather than relegated solely to Shakespearean soliloquies.  \n\nAs someone who loves politics and literature, I loved this course because the professors accounted for what George Orwell deemed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political impulse.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Every writer, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to realize, whether intentionally or otherwise, is motivated by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of the kind of society they should strive after.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d All writing has political purpose. To say that art should not be political is a political statement in itself.\n\nIn short, this course made me a much better person. For that reason, I highly recommend it.","This class is a great way to read amazing literary works that might be difficult to find time to read otherwise. Although it was difficult to keep up at times, I am incredibly pleased with all that I've accomplished over one semester.","Taking this course was the best academic choice I made my first semester, and I cannot wait to continue on to Humanities 10b. Not only are the professors involved insightful and engaging, but they are excited to interact with the students. There are ample opportunities, through lunches, office hours, and field trips, to get to know those teaching and those taking the course. The course materials, carefully chosen, are truly essential works. They are excellent representatives of the western literary tradition. The variety in time period, culture, and perspective of the works, I think, gives students the foundation for a true literary education.","READ THE BOOKS. I shirked some of the reading and regretted it. Not because it hurt me in the class (you can get away with it...shhhhh). But because I was wrong to miss the opportunity to absorb all I could about EACH of these books. I would give this class enough weight in your schedule; don't pile up stuff around this and treat this as the easy course \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0you'll wanna dedicate all the time you can to reading these books.","It's a great class, but a bit too excessive on the reading which really takes away from the impact of the course.","This class is a personalized introduction to the field of humanities. It's a chance to get feedback on your own skills and potential within several disciplines. You might think you know what you want to study, but that study probably takes a different form at a higher level than what you're used to, and this class is here to introduce you to those differences.","This class is epic in every sense of the word. You will not regret taking it.","This class is A LOT of reading. Really too much reading. And it really doesn't make sense to take a Great Books class like this if you are not going to do the reading. You really can't take this class and get a lot of out of it and do the reading if you are taking other time-intensive classes. Also, it can be a bit frustrating since you read a lot, and only have 1 section to discuss a book like the Odyssey. It's a great intro the humanities and the western canon, but unless you are sure you are really interested in spending lots of time reading interesting but challenging works.","Be aware that the texts will not be studied in depth, but that the course is more about the idea of studying humanities-- quite literally an intro course. Through this course you may find out whether or not you truly wish to be involved in the humanities at Harvard pretty early on.","If you like or even tolerate reading, take this class!","The only way to really get the most out of this class is to read the books, which is hard to do because you only have a week per work and if you have a heavy schedule it can be overwhelming.","This class focuses on background and context of the works in lectures.  It is an intro course, so you will read a lot and not get a chance to learn too much about any text.  I personally like more literary analysis and discussion of the text itself, so got bored with the huge focus on context and background of the works.  I wanted to talk about the works themselves!  The paper topics were so broad that I felt I never got to dig in and find something I loved to write about.  Overall, I wish I would have taken a more intense english class.  This class is absolutely challenging, but not the kind of challenging I wanted it to be.  It just wasn't really for me.","The Professors are great!","Take the class, but don't necessarily expect to do well.","You have to be willing to read early and read a lot. If you are, this class will be fantastic. Being able to be in small section will professors who are rockstars like greenblatt and menand is a once in a lifetime experience. Every college student should read these books. Also, the field trips are very fun.","Take this course if you want to learn from some of the strongest professors at the college and read the best texts Western tradition has to offer. However, realize that the course is not perfect. Often the reading load is too much and you may begin to find, as I did, that you don't need to do all the reading to do well in section. When it comes time to write papers, you may begin to see that the obscurity of an argument is regarded more highly than its strength. I am not going to take Hum10b, but I'm really glad I took Hum10a.","If you are at all interested in literature, books, or culture in general, take this course.  This course was largely responsible for me switching from a STEM trajectory to a Humanities concentration, and I know I am not alone in that.  The professors are all experts in the texts taught, offer unique persepctives on them, and sections are exemplary of what a good section should be like:  engaging, supplementary to lecture material without tedious review, and generally fun.  Take this course, because it does what CS50 did for computer science, but with the humanities -- and does so much more effectively.","Provides the communicative space to read and talk about the most important texts in the Western tradition. This course should be mandatory. Reading these books makes you a better person.","The more time you can spend reading these works and thinking on them, the better. I imagine this is the kind of class it would be nice to take with a friend, with whom one could continue to talk about the ideas outside a limited section time. Lectures are wonderful, and section is helpful for providing a bit more of a foothold, but I'm not leaving with a feeling of noteworthy familiarity with any of the works. The course really begins to come together in the last weeks, and the ultimate lecture, in which professors answered student questions, was moving, and a powerful reminder of why I had taken the course and chosen to study humanities.","Be ready to read a lot and discuss what you read for two classes before moving on.  Definitely a valuable class for anyone who wants to be exposed to some of the most important literature of our culture, but don't expect to get much more than a brief exposure.","This course is challenging, but engaging. It's an ambitious undertaking: 2500+ years of western intellectual history in one semester. The paper grading is not lenient, and the sections are sure to challenge your assumptions. This class will help you to connect with a deep literary tradition, one that shapes everything about our experience in the modern, western world. In that sense, Hum10 is the essential Harvard course, a must take in your ivy league career.","This was a great gateway humanities course taught by amazing professors. If you are interested in pursuing anything in the humanities in the future, or if you are concentrating in the sciences but want some exposure to the humanities, this is the perfect class for you. The texts are worth reading for life. Lecture was so engaging and interesting. At times section discussion was a bit stilted because of students grandstanding, but nevertheless worth it. If you take this class, the only way you will get the most of it is by actually doing the readings. For those of us who actually did all of the readings, the workload was incredibly high. The course offers numerous resources, and all of the professors hold office hours and lunches after their lectures. Take advantage of these opportunities. The TFs were also awesome resources. Finally, the course offered several free field trips\/events outside of the classroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do them! I could not have asked for a better way to explore the cultural hotspots in Boston during my freshman fall.","It is incredible. If you have the chance to take it, definitely do. It is true that it only offers voices from a piece of the Western literary tradition, but that restriction only means that it's essential to find courses like it that explore other pieces of other traditions. The meaning in these works is very real, from a literary standpoint and from a human standpoint.","I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is willing to do all of the reading and really intellectually engage with the class. If you are unsure of your commitment and don't think you would do all or most of the reading, I would recommend taking a different class, because so much of what you will get out of this class is in the material.","Hum 10a with Professor Greenblatt was a wild ride.\n\nProfessor Greenblatt and Taylor were the most caring, warm, accessible, friendly, kind teachers a student could ask for. Add brilliant to that list and you've got a winning combination. They guided section every week deftly and diligently, often relating the week's text to some broad, lofty theme in literature (or life) that would leave me staggered by the implications. (Do note that this is by necessity and design a survey course, and so it focuses far more on the forest than the trees.) This was the case even when I was not fond of the readings or hadn't done them in much depth: after reading Rousseau, which I was not particularly fond of, we had an eye-opening discussion of subjectivity\/objectivity within literature, and after reading Ulysses, which I definitely for sure read every single word of in the two weeks we were allotted, we talked about the representation of consciousness within literature. Both fascinating topics which had me utterly rapt. And of course I got even more out of section when I did justice to the readings, which I'd obviously recommend as they're all lynchpins of the Western canon.\n\nHum 10a also fosters a great community. I got to know everyone in my section decently well this semester, and a couple of them are now my very close friends. Everyone in section was very bright and eager and curious, which just made for an excellent group. I don't know whether it's the selective nature of the course (which I'm not particularly fond of, but I suppose it's necessary given that professors run the sections) or the self-selecting nature of the students, but Greenblatt section had a wonderful dynamic going on that I'll sorely miss.\n\nThere are also some ancillary aspects of the course that are super awesome. Prof Greenblatt and Taylor were super accessible, and I had a bunch of enlightening conversations, concerning literature, life, and their many intersections, with them outside of class. The Hum 10a staff also set up a bunch of very nice events (e.g. visits to the MFA\/Houghton library, a performance of Lear, etc.) for students that give a nice glimpse of what it means to live the humanistic life.\n\ntl;dr Hum 10a was exhilarating. Take it.","This class is great if you are hoping to read the classics. You will learn from legends, be challenged in your literary and philosophical analysis and learn to think about works in their cultural\/historical context. All wonderful things! Be prepared that this is not an easy gen Ed class. To the contrary, it was the hardest class I had this semester from a workload and writing standpoint. You will think and read and write and be stretched in all those capacities. If that sounds like a noble challenge, charge into it head on. I'm glad I took the course.","A challenging, very fast-paced, in-depth look at the works of the Western cannon, building toward the reading of Joyce's Ulysses for the final paper. Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading and thinking independently about the course's material--with the volume of material covered per week so large, section discussion time will be packed and ultimately insufficient to cover even half of the interesting, important points in any given work! Definitely more for concentrators or lovers of literature than students looking for a low-commitment GedEd. Humanities 10a will require a high input of time and effort, but its returns will be well worth the investment.","It's tough but it is also fun. It will teach you how to write coherent essays. It is also one of the few opportunities you will have as a freshman to be in a small section with a professor (and the Hum10a Professors are all leaders in their fields).","The best class here!","Your experience will be defined by your section leader. For me, this worked out phenomenally, and I had a great time. That said, the material is very jumpy -- even the lecturer switches week to week, so it's challenging to feel like you're learning anything coherent. It's a great excuse to read a ton of books you might not otherwise get to, however, but be aware that in a more focused course you might get more out of them. If you're not going to do the readings (you can get away with it, but not easily) don't take it. You will get exactly nothing out of it.","Be prepared to do a lot of reading, but it will definitely change your perspective of narration and literature in the Western Canon.","This is an amazing class. Take advantage of it and keep up with the readings, because section is so rewarding and I wish I had kept up better so I could have gotten even more out of the discussions. Lectures are also engaging and interesting.","Loved it! Taylor Cowdery's the best!","Not worth it. This class is as mechanical and bland as any introductory science\/math\/social science lecture class. If you want to study these works, take seminars in their respective departments. The course moves so extremely fast that you barely have time to scratch the surface (and I mean this quite seriously) before you are whisked away to another monumental work that you will not get anything out of. If you are not a freshman, be warned. This class is very much geared toward first years.","This is a class where what you put into it is what you get out of it. If you are prepared to read a book a week, think deeply about complex topics of literature, participate in discussion, and go to professor office hours, then this class is absolutely amazing. I have a deep sense of accomplishment in finishing this class and realizing all that I have read and learned.","Know it's a lot of reading, but the lectures and sections are SO GOOD","You will get the most out of this class if you dedicate yourself to the readings, if you participate in section, and if you attend the out of class events.","It is a ton of reading!!! That needs to be said up front. It will take you a long time to read and absorb everything that this course throws at you. However, it is an extremely rewarding experience that you will learn a lot from. The intimate interaction with tenured faculty in the humanities is an unparalleled opportunity.","PLEASE READ: I came to Harvard as a definite English major, and I had read over 500 books.  However, this class absolutely knocked the life out of me.  We were literally expected to read a lengthy and difficult book and write a response paper every week, plus write three long papers.  While a noble goal, this was completely overwhelming.  Freshman fall is incredibly stressful, and this class sucked away all of my already-nonexistent free time.  I never once used SparkNotes in high school, and LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE STUDENT survived on SparkNotes for this class.  However, this could be awesome if you have the time to actually read the books and your other classes are super easy!","If you're planning to enroll in this course, you definitely should love reading and writing.","This course was the highlight of my first semester. The roster of professors is superb; ANY chance you can find to get to know them is a chance you need to take, and the TFs (Taylor in particular) are not only great about facilitating section discussion and working with you for feedback on your assignments but about holding office hours to talk about everything from what you're reading that week to their experience with a given department or program. The support system is unreal.","This class requires a familiarity with many works of literature and an ability to comfortably write about and discuss literature. It is not an introductory level humanities class. Also the section is supposed to be the highlight of the class but Professor Roilos' section is awful and will ruin the class.","It's tough. But it's definitely worthwhile.","While the required reading is overwhelming at times, it is definitely worth it as I felt I got the most out of the weeks where I read most thoroughly. It makes lecture and discussion all the more valuable when you come in with a foundational understanding of the work that can be built on. There is no doubt that this course takes time, but you will learn so much if you put the time in and commit to the works!","Try to read all the books in detail. They all are amazing, and the lectures as well. It is sometimes difficult to finish the books in the busy Harvard schedule, but without reading them, it will be difficult to learn how literature developed over time clearly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"9.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"79","response rate":"88.61","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HUMAN 10a","course_id":"12493","cat_num":"50362","1s":"2","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"24","5s":"33"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"HUMAN 10a","course_id":"12493","cat_num":"50362","1s":"1","2s":"20","3s":"29","4s":"7","5s":"8"}},"success":true}
