Also, start on the assignments early as they require sink time (time when you're not actively working on them).","A reasonable survey of techniques used to prove properties about systems.  In its current form, it's not very much work.  Of course, note to the reader, the \"r\" in \"252r\" means that the course material rotates...","You get out what you put in.","Greg is an excellent lecturer. The course was rather disorganized, but he probably won't give the same course again anyway, so it doesn't matter. Take a class from Greg. Your mind will expand.","Not the most organized this year, but the topic is extremely interesting.","This year 252r was a very hands-on seminar on how to model and prove different programming language systems in coq. You learn how to use a very powerful tool (coq), and you get to hear Professor Morrisett share a lot of his insights as he codes in a way you're unlikely to get anywhere else. However, if you're not interested in the technicalities of computer-formalized pl theory, the class can be pretty random."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course is very dependent on the topic and instructor, but if you're interested in the topic that's being covered, take it.","Good course; the final project is a semester long endeavor that will let you actually accomplish something relating to information flow. Steve is awesome and a great project adviser.","Make sure you're very interested in the subject before taking this course. Perhaps read a few of the papers ahead of time.","This particular iteration of 252r covered the interesting, but seemingly rather new, field of information flow.  The course readings were generally worthwhile, but were not always coherent or cohesive as a whole.  Though the structure and execution of this particular iteration of the course was not the best, the course overall was still worth taking, and the final research project was also an interesting exploration.  Even with the big picture sometimes missing, acquiring the details by taking the course was interesting and bore little overhead."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["To non-PL students: you *can* take this class, and you *will* get a lot out of it, just be prepared to (a) feel like you're drowning for the first month-ish, and (b) spend a lot more time than everyone else outside of class during that period. Don't try to take it with a heavy load, but Greg will make the effort to make it work for you if you do. Take it.","Great for digging in deep into compilers. Mostly focused on front-end optimizations and doesn't do muscular with codegeneration or runtime issues."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Really great course, with great discussions.","The topic was cybersecurity this year, but the topic will probably be really interesting every year so I'd highly recommend the course. To date, this has been my favorite course at Harvard. It had well-selected papers that hit topics I'd always wanted to learn more about (Bitcoin, Tor) and introduced me to topics I hadn't heard of before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":null,"difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"4","response rate":"25.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 252r","course_id":"1267","cat_num":"1986","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 252r","course_id":"1267","cat_num":"1986","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 252r","course_id":"1267","cat_num":"1986","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
