As the title of the course suggests, the focus is on the ethical issues of the Age of Enlightenment, but since those were very much at the center of any contemporary discussion, it is a very good entry point to the literature of the century. Prof. McDonald's very clear, knowledgeable, and kind: it is a pleasure to listen to her weekly introductions of key issues. Because of the nature of the subject-matter, the discussions may run a little dry from time to time.\r\n\r\nEven if the reading load is unpredictable from week to week, with a little bit of planning, the coursework should be manageable: the bi-weekly response paper helps you stay on top of it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.80","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 139b","course_id":"11104","cat_num":"28098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH 139b","course_id":"11104","cat_num":"28098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 139b","course_id":"11104","cat_num":"28098","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
