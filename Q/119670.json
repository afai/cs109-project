The goals of the course are somewhat nebulous, readings are mostly relatively boring bibliographical essays, and the class often felt a bit directionless. That said, if you want to spend some time working on a Manchu related research topic, this class would be a good space to do so. It is also a chance to really start working with Manchu materials at Harvard, and so is worth doing on those grounds.","Do it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"2.25","difficulty":"2.75","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"7","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
