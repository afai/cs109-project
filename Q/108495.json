Lots of insightful readings from different foreign policy crises; however reading is on the heavy side and often superfluous. This seminar relies more on student discussion than professor instruction, which seems like a bit of a missed opportunity.","It's very interesting to study one of the most important and controversial Americans of the 20th century. Professor Ferguson's relationship with and knowledge of Kissinger means you get access to readings and documents most people would not, and it's definitely worth taking if you get to meet him at the end, as we did.","If you are interested in  diplomacy and\/or national security strategy in the post WWII period, this is a great course for you. You will learn an enormous amount by examining Kissinger's statecraft. Be prepared, however, for some bias towards Kissinger.","This is a very difficult course that requires a lot. Prof. Ferguson assigns a great deal of reading and expects one to read it all closely. Likewise the research paper is daunting, but I still felt the class was worth it.","Professor Ferguson is brilliant and very accessible. The material is really interesting and the readings are great. Highly recommend as a research seminar.","By far the most rewarding academic experience at Harvard. The opportunity to spend 2 hours a week with Professor Ferguson examining one of the core individuals of American foreign policy of the last half century should not be passed over. Do all the readings because you'll get way more out of the course. Ferguson is accessible and friendly as well.","Professor Ferguson was an EXCELLENT teacher with lots of interesting insights into not only Kissinger's life and career, but also American foreign policy at large.  I learned an immense amount from the course, and really enjoyed it!  Getting to go to New York and meet Henry Kissinger at the end of the course was not a bad perk either.","This was a great class. I didn't know anything about Kissinger beforehand, but studying diplomacy turned out to be fascinating. It's not too much work (just heavy reading) and Ferguson is a great professor."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Kissinger is one of the most fascinating individuals in history to study and this class will teach you a great deal about how to conduct a successful foreign policy and what it takes to be a statesman.","A great class. Ferguson is in his element in this class.  Be prepared to do a lot of reading though.","Best class at Harvard.  It's a pretty unbelievable class if you can get in and a high-powered discussion every week that you have to be on your game for. Try to soak as much of discussion in as you can.  Ferguson and your classmates have a lot of interesting things to say about the matter, and you're going to learn a lot of interesting viewpoints of how foreign policy was conducted (and still is today).  The relevancy that Ferguson brings is quite cool and exciting for a history concentrator to see.  We also had the opportunity to meet Dr. Kissinger in New York, which was mind-blowing after reading so much about him.","TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Hands down my favorite course at Harvard so far. It's fascinating to learn about Dr. Kissinger's theory on world order and how he applies it to the practice of foreign policy decision making. What course can be better than a seminar taught by Professor Ferguson on one of the most influential and controversial political figures of the 20th century? \nBe ready to do lots of heavy reading.","You are offered the opportunity to learn about the most important person in American foreign policy. This class teaches you more about how to think about foreign policy and American values than any other class I've encountered.","If there is ever a course that you should try to take, it's this one. Prof. Ferguson is brilliant and an incredible teacher. The topic is fascinating, the discussions are as well, and meeting Dr. Kissinger himself at the end of the semester was an experience that I will never forget.","Great class! Learned a lot about strategic thinking and foreign policy in the 1960s\/70s. Professor Ferguson is an incredible lecturer and educator. If you haven't, you should definitely take a class with him before you graduate.","This class is incredible, but just make sure you are ok with the time required - it is substantially more work than other similar seminars. That being said, this class was one of the highlights of my time at Harvard, so definitely take it if you can.","Take this class.  Professor Ferguson is fabulous, and here he is a teaching a subject about which he is the foremost expert.  The other students in the seminar are also excellent, and everyone is working to gain a better understanding of the subject matter, and to improve themselves as academics.  That, and there is a possibility of going to New York to actually meet with Henry Kissinger.  Do the readings, figure out what each reading is trying to say, and be sure to contribute to discussion; it's fun and you'll receive great feedback.  Overall, this class has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Harvard.","If you love history and are up for a challenge, Professor Ferguson is your man. This is an incredible class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"7.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"18","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 89h","course_id":"2384","cat_num":"38953","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"14"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 89h","course_id":"2384","cat_num":"38953","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 89h","course_id":"2384","cat_num":"38953","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
