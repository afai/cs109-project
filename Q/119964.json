'08":{"comments":["I think this class is excellently taught.","The course is organized in a very straightforward way, and Matsumura-sensei is a wonderful, easily-accessible professor. However, as with any Japanese language course above the beginner level, be prepared to put in the work, because they are all very time consuming courses.","This class will improve all aspects of your Japanese, especially your ability to give your opinion and answer questions in a clear and organized manner.  Be prepared, however, to devote lots of time to the homework and memorization required for this class.  There is no shortcut.","This course may seem challenging in the beginning but if you do your homework, you will be fine. I highly recommend the course\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou will have lots of fun. Go for it!","If you really want to learn Japanese, take this class!"]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["only for those who truly love Japanese and plan to continue learning it.  faint of heart need not apply","This is the class where you gain the skills to really manage and engage with Japanese popular culture as well as social concerns.","I'd recommend it with the caveat that it takes up a lot of time. You have to be really interested in learning Japanese to put this amount of time into a course","It is a lot of work, but you get that much out of it at the end of the day.","Very fun, not work-intensive, interesting readings and discussion of interesting topics concerning Japanese culture and society.","Make sure to take a significant amount of time every day to review materials for class.","It is one of the best classes I have had at Harvard, and is a very rewarding and enjoyable experience every day.","the more work you put into the course the more you will get out of it, working through all of the homework assignments will prepare you for exams","This class will synthesize all the Japanese you have learned thus far and help you develop many skills in the language that will move you closer to fluency.","Harder than 130a. Noticeably so. Expect to either devote a sizeably larger chunk of time to it or to be confused in class on a day-to-day basis.","If you like Japanese enough to be at this level, take this class.","The class is great and you will never regret taking this class.","Be prepared to do a lot of reading. It takes up a lot of your time.","You can't slack off - everyday is important. Whether there's something to hand in or not, there is homework of some kind to done.","Matsumura sensei is always very organized and an excellent conversationalist."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The sensei are great!","It's a good class, but it is very time intensive. If you don't really have the time, it just gets to be a burden, because it is not a very \"fun\" class.","Take this if you are willing to do the work.","This class will truly take your Japanese to the next level beyond regular conversation, and teach you increasingly sophisticated grammar and vocabulary. This is an excellent class for those whose end goal is fluency and wish to spend significant time in Japan or work there. You will definitely feel a tangible improvement in your ability to communicate in both formal and informal settings.","When a student gets to this level of Japanese, it's really important to persevere and have a genuine interest in the language. Compared to 130a, the readings were more enjoyable and the creative writing assignments were a great chance to express ourselves. Take it especially if you would like to improve your reading ability!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This isn't a course for people who want to learn to speak Japanese fluently, but it's good for those who want to read scholarly articles.","The senseis are great, very nice, and very patient. I think you will learn a lot about reading and writing, and all of the materials are very interesting - all in very different ways. Although I did feel that my speaking ability actually deteriorated after returning from Japan, that is to be expected. That said, the emphasis of this course does not appear to be on speaking and grammar drilling.","An interesting range of readings that correspond to more vocab and more grammar, so you can express yourself in more and more ways! Yay.","This is a great class if you are looking to improve your Japanese seriously. However, it is very demanding so shouldn't be taken without consideration of other workloads.","Teachers are amazing!","Matsumura sensei is an amazing teacher! Come and enjoy a deep inquiry into Japanese language and culture!","This is a great class with great teachers.  However, you should definitely feel confident with your Japanese language skills - I was not and although I really enjoyed the class, it took a lot of time and work for me to understand what was going on.","This class was difficult, but a lot of fun too. The instructors are the best; I only wish they could keep teaching me Japanese past 3rd year!","The teachers really care about each student, so no matter your proficiency level, you can and will get better at Japanese if you take this class.","If you've taken 130a and are tired of just talking about social problems in Japan, don't think that 130b is going to be the same. This semester focuses much more on creative writing and discussing complex and thought-provoking issues (e.g. what goes in to forming a person's identity?).","If you want to get better at reading\/writing Japanese, this is a great class. For speaking\/listening, not that great, but still useful. As with many language classes, there is a lot of tedious stuff, and the daily meetings can drain you over time. I wish there was more learning about the culture.","Learning a language involves learning the culture where that language is spoken. This is a course that suits such purpose.","This is a very well-taught language course. I would highly recommend the experience of having Matsumura-sensei as an instructor!","If you've taken Japanese to this point, you probably know whether you want to continue or not.  Know that the class is very structured, as was 130a, and there is little variety to the classes.  If you do the readings, you'll have no problem, but they are sometimes boring.","If future students have a great interest in becoming fluent in Japanese, this course is definitely a course to take.  My Japanese improved a lot."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["J130b is a pleasure! Matsumura-sensei and Fujisaki-sensei are so dedicated to their students' progress, which is the best part of the course. The readings themselves are cool, loved doing 10 pages of Murakami Haruki's \"Wind-up Bird Chronicle\", less so the subsequent readings about Japanese traditional landscapes and medical provisioning, but still good readings. \r\nImportant to keep in mind that this is an academic-Japanese geared class, it is less useful for improving everyday speaking proficiency but that does improve as well.","It's a lot of work, but you learn a ton and the teachers are kind and funny.","This class is certainly very good for continuing your studies of Japanese. We do many readings on a variety of topics, and cover lots of new kanji and vocabulary. Personally I felt as though I struggled to keep up with the kanji that we were expected to know, but I think that is a personal difficulty rather than a structural class problem.","The work is difficult, and there is a lot of it, but you cannot ask for better instructors than these, and the readings are great! I'm profoundly sad to be leaving these instructors next year.","This is not a course for crammers. If you participate in class and be genuinely interested in the topic, you will find the course very manageable.","This is a great course. It was definitely a lot of work, but you will learn a lot, have a good time, and make some friends. Definitely recommended for those interested in improving their Japanese.","If you took 130a, there shouldn't be too many surprises. This is a great class, even with its sometimes extreme workload, and you'll come out of it feeling much better about your Japanese skills.","Like 130a, this course is much different from 1st and 2nd year Japanese with much less busy work.  Prof. Matsumura is fantastic, quite laid-back, and extremely enjoyable to work with.  I especially recommend this course for grad students who may be busy with many other demands; it is both manageable and rewarding.","Really fun class, you get to read interesting pieces about relevant social issues in Japan and watch really fun movies. Definitely take this, especially if you are coming out of 120 or coming back from a summer in Japan!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["I think this class is just really great, and as my major class this semester, I looked forward to going to Japanese and knowing I would learn.","It's a lot of work but worth it.","This course will keep you very busy, but if you are committed to improving in Japanese, it will be enjoyable and really worthwhile.","Japanese 130 was the most fun course I took this past year. Matsumura sensei and Masui sensei are fantastic teachers who really care for their students. Definitely take this course if you like the Japanese language and\/or culture!","This is a very fun class, but it definitely eats your schedule. Only take it if you are willing to put the time in.","This was the last year with Matsumura sensei, unfortunately. Her enthusiasm and intuition as a teacher were wonderful to learn under. The materials covered were fun and interesting, probably more so for me than 130a. We watched several movies this semester, which were a fun way to hear more colloquial Japanese. Take it if you took the previous semester, or risk feeling guilty the rest of the semester.","It takes a special class to get people willing to trek all the way to Vanserg every morning at 9am, and this class was certainly special. The readings are great -- being able to read Murakami in the original Japanese made me incredibly proud of how far I have come as a Japanese learner. We also delved deeply into societal issues -- environmental degradation, the shortage of doctors in the countryside, the idea of identity among ethnically Japanese people who were raised abroad, etc. Our readings on these subjects were challenging to be sure, but the satisfaction that you get from being able to discuss such complex issues in a foreign language makes it totally worth it. The kanji and vocab quizzes are simple, and the level of homework is totally fair. The sense of community in the class is great -- I felt really close to my fellow third years. Both Matsumura-sensei, who is unfortunately leaving, and Masui-sensei, who is fortunately staying, were phenomenal, caring, devoted instructors. This class also furnishes you with so many opportunities -- I got a summer internship in Tokyo out of taking this class. To summarize -- wonderful sensei, wonderful material, and a wonderful class environment.","You learn so much in 130. The only thing that will be missing next year is Matsumura-sensei, who is one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had. She touches you as a teacher, makes you want to learn and try your best. She knew where you struggled before you even knew, and she helps you learn to the best or your abilities. Even without her, Japanese 130 will only make your Japanese more efficient.","This is an EXCELLENT course! I definitely recommend people to continue on taking Japanese 130 after taking 120 or attending one of the two summer programs (Princeton in Ishikawa and Hokkaido International Foundation) or even for people placed into 130. It is very very sad that Matsumura-sensei is retiring this year. She is a VERY VERY GOOD and VERY VERY KIND sensei! Yet, Masui-sensei will still be here! Masui-sensei is also REALLY GOOD and REALLY NICE, so I think this is a pretty simple decision: just take Japanese 130."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["That the material is fun and engaging, and the class very enjoyable. While the amount of class time and homework may prove challenging, completion of the course is well worth the time.","If you took 130a, you most likely would be taking 130b and basically, 130b is better (you'd be adjusted to the workload by now). The readings and discussion topics this time are very interesting and the class moves at a very good pace - not too slow and not too fast; just enough time to absorb the material and enjoy it. The class also starts to focus more on fluent reading and writing (both novel form and formally). The class is just as fun as all the Japanese classes offered! Yagi-sensei also is a great professor who really does care about the class (you'll be friends with everyone if you aren't already!) and Masui-sensei is an awesome drill section instructor.","The time I spend in this class is the most relaxing and happy hour of my day. Love it.","Like the other Japanese courses, this one will expand your vocabulary, increase your kanji recognition, improve your writing, and frankly better all other aspects of your Japanese. This course does take time\/work\/energy, so be prepared. But Yagi sensei, and Masui sensei are incredibly understanding, just communicate with them. Subjects matter is interesting and relevant to present times. Personally learned a lot about Japan's present nuclear circumstances and medical problem.","I really enjoyed the readings, and that's one of the aspects that made me like this course. I also loved working with the senseis because Harvard's Japanese Language Department is just absolutely phenomenal. The few issues, though, were that the comprehension homework was sometimes a bit hard to get into, and debates\/discussions could be frustrating. But, that's all part of learning a language! The content you learn and the grammar\/vocab you acquire to talk about it is pretty cool, and after third year there should be little problem in understanding a large range of texts, especially in longer opinion pieces in news, although news articles like on NHK still use a lot of formal language and kango (Chinese borrowings) that is not yet accessible.","This class again shows that the Japanese language program at Harvard is without equal. Furthermore, Yagi sensei and Masui sensei are absolutely amazing teachers. They really care about their students and are deeply committed to helping you learn. \r\nThis has been my favorite class at Harvard so far."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"12","response rate":"58.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"JAPAN 130b","course_id":"849","cat_num":"6904","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"JAPAN 130b","course_id":"849","cat_num":"6904","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"JAPAN 130b","course_id":"849","cat_num":"6904","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
