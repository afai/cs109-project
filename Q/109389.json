The topic is interesting and the instructor approaches it with great excitement. The readings are not substantial, compared to other Expos courses, so it is a great option for someone looking to learn a bit about archaeology with light work and fulfill the Expos requirement. Plus, the paper prompts give you a great deal of freedom.","The subject is general enough to be relatively interesting to just about anyone. Generally well organized, sometimes the essay topics are very general.","This specific EXPOS class was great in terms of feedback but maybe a little lacking in guidance. Janling is great, though, and you'll enjoy the material.","Who Owns the Past? is, by far, the best Expository Writing class.  I initially went in with the mindset that Expository Writing is one of those requirements that you just have to deal with and won't enjoy it.  That is absolutely false with this class.  Janling is an amazing preceptor and is always willing to help.  All the course materials are really fascinating.  I highly recommend this class!","Janling is a great preceptor. He gives ample critiques on your drafts, so you know what to improve before the graded version is due. He also is very thoughtful - planning movie events and barbecues to bring us together as a class! Overall, I had a great experience, and I wouldn't choose any other Expos. I can objectively say his suggestions always improved my draft, and made me a better writer. He really wants to help you, and really cares about the class! The readings aren't incredibly time-intensive. However, I would caution that you should definitely have an interest in archaeology before taking this class. I found the readings enjoyable, but I could see how they wouldn't be if you weren't interested in the subject.","This class is not particularly interesting, and nearly every aspect of it is forced.","This class is an nice look into the social and political entanglements of archeology, but not as much into how work in the field is actually conducted.","Expos 20 (Who Owns the Past?) is an interesting Expos class for anyone interested in archaeology. It delves deep into archaeological issues and material is very comprehensive and enjoyable to read. Its workload is medium; readings\/assignments can be nuisances, but the class is not too bad. Essays are manageable (there are only three). Overall, if you have any interest in archaeology, take this Expos. You shouldn't be disappointed."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Expos is a necessary evil and one of those things you just have to push through. This particular expos class (Who Owns the Past) is a bit of a bummer. Very little of it is actually about archaeology; most of the course actually focuses on the implications of archaeology on society as a whole, which can be a little abstract when students don't have the much-needed base of archaeological knowledge that the course assumes. Still, watching Indiana Jones is pretty awesome, and the paper on it isn't half bad. Overall, this class is fairly decent, but don't take it simply because you love the idea of archaeology--only take it if you have some interest in the greater applications of archaeology.","As an expos class the writing assignments are fair. The main advice would be only take this course if you are interested in archaeology otherwise the readings and some of the assignments are pretty boring."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"2.60","enrollment":"11","response rate":"45.45","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.226","course_id":"10614","cat_num":"54641","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.226","course_id":"10614","cat_num":"54641","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.226","course_id":"10614","cat_num":"54641","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
