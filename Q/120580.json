Be ready to spend a lot of time on the course though. And don't take this class if you get easily frustrated with technology. The program you learn how to use, ArcGIS, is one of the least user-friendly programs I've ever worked with.","A super fun hands-on class; the weekly assignments are occasionally time consuming but really interesting.
