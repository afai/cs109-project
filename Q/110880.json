'07":{"comments":["Take it, even if you have absolutely no need for this course, this is mathematics at its best!!!\r\n\r\nOtherwise I would recommend looking out for Prof. Nicoara lectures, everything she does should be worth taking.","I would strongly recommend the course to anyone I could find...however, Andreea is moving on after this semester, so a major component of that recommendation would have to be directed at students in another university.  The course itself, in the abstract, is still a wonderful piece of mathematics  for anyone who wants to know where the subject goes after you learn to compute weird integrals, or wants to see the proofs of some famous theorems, and some of the topics are basically essential as pieces of mathematical culture (the stuff on elliptic functions, for example)."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Find out what the instructor is planning on covering at the start of the semester, and ask yourself whether this is actually what you want to be learning.","If you ever get the chance to take a class with Professor Siu, you are in for a wild ride.","study hard with strong interest"]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This class was SO AWESOME. The material was interesting, especially (in my opinion) the elliptic curves and modular forms stuff. Wow... my mind is blown. A lot of what made the class awesome was Professor McMullen. Don't worry about dozing off or getting bored in lecture -- he will grab you and take you on a 90 minute tour of some really exciting mathematics. Honestly, I've taken three math classes here that I really enjoyed, and they were all taught by McMullen. What a great lecturer. The homework was pretty tough (for me), but stimulating and challenging and not messy to write up once you saw the trick. One thing though -- I'm writing up my problem set from over Thanksgiving vacation right now, and I'm also looking at a massive take-home final. This class has an intense workload!","it's quite enlightening. There's some crazy stuff that goes down.","This was the best-taught math course I have ever attended.","If you are interested in modern mathematics, you should absolutely take this course. The material is central to many diverse research areas, and the lecturer does a great job of highlighting these connections. Using an algebraic perspective and some basic geometric tools, Professor McMullen really simplifies the proofs of many of the classical theorems presented in the course, enabling him to cover more material than in most second courses in complex analysis. It was a joy to attend this course every day of the semester, because each lecture overflowed with clarity and insight.","It's challenging, but if it's taught by McMullen, it is definitely worth taking. He is a gifted, inspiring lecturer - probably one of the best teachers at Harvard.","Professor McMullen is an excellent teacher, and he presents ideas in a very clear and motivated way.","Professor McMullen is an incredible math lecturer, and complex analysis is a truly beautiful topic.","One of the best courses I have taken at Harvard.","McMullen is an excellent teacher whose course notes and problem sets are really helpful. I learned a lot from this course."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Professor Joe Harris is among the absolutely best lecturers you will find at Harvard, and he is a wonderful person who genuinely cares about his students. It is worth taking any class taught by him, just because of his geometric insights, clear explanations and great heuristics.","Interesting content; Prof. Harris does a good job with this. Substantial work required. Broad preparation is very helpful.","Harris is a boss, and the material's pretty cool.","Professor Harris is great. The material is central to a lot of mathematics, and the later topics of the course (conformal mapping, elliptic functions, and analytic number theory) were fascinating.","This is the best complex analysis class. Ever.","Though numbered as a graduate course, it is attended exclusively by undergraduates.","Complex numbers are magic.","The course covers material very quickly. Make sure to keep up with the course through the problem sets, office hours and sections. \r\nStein and Shakarchi is a good supplement for additional reading.","Complex Analysis is beautiful. Harris was great (except for when he messed up, but he's still a chill professor).","Joe Harris is an amazing professor who motivates things superbly with a stellar geometric intuition.","Harris is an excellent lecturer."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Was really great - not too difficult but really interesting material.","Like any math class, this will vary greatly from year to year. Since it was our lecturer's first year, and CA is not her primary field of study, we moved more slowly than some years in the past (namely we did most of Ahlfors, excepting ch. 8, and a few additional topics). Still, it was a very good introduction to more advanced topics (elliptic functions, Picard theorems) than you might find in a first course. Overall, it was very enjoyable and laid back. I would definitely recommend this class for undergrad math concentrators with sufficient preparation.","Awesome subject, awesome prof.","Complex analysis is something that every math concentrator should take, especially at the graduate level because it's so beautiful. We were lucky to have Suk teach it this year, since Suk is very laid back and the pace of the class gave us enough time to fully absorb all the material before moving on.","Sukhada is a great professor and incredibly accommodating. The material is tough but the presentation is good."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Professor Schmid is a very good lecturer and this class is generally pretty awesome. The psets were a bit lacklustre, however; it would have been nice if they had contained more difficult problems.","It is not strictly necessary to take math 113 before taking this class -- but if you want to skip it, you should read a little before, and take extra care to practice actually computing contour integrals.","Pretty straightforward class if you understand 110 material. Blitz is fun. The class can overlap with the book a lot (as in the lectures may be nothing new), but the material itself is quite engaging.","Complex analysis is... really cool. This statement seems to apply to complex analysis more than other subfields of math, for some reason or another. A lot of the results are extremely nice, and problems are fun to think about. Also, Schmid is an excellent professor, so definitely take this class if he's teaching it again.","Once you get used to Prof Schmid's style, he is a very good lecturer. I enjoyed talking with him in office hours.","I really enjoyed the material in this course.  Definitely consider taking.","Review topology (especially topics such as covering maps) before taking this course.  If Professor Schmid is teaching the course again, enroll with caution; I found his lecture style exceedingly dry, and he makes far less of an effort to motivate new topics than other professors do.","complex analysis is nice, schmid is a super nice guy but doesn't give much intuition or motivation sometimes, so lecture can be a bit dry","This is a great class.  The material is very interesting.","The class is very interesting. You learn lots of cool theorems. Lecture can be a bit boring at times though.","The class was good and logically presented, but sometimes it moved a little slow and didn't feel motivated (of course later we learned why we were doing certain things).  The homework was mostly pretty easy, though the take-home final was challenging.","Complex analysis is a really nice topic (this sentiment seems widespread). Most of the material in this course seemed relatively accessible, so I would definitely recommend taking it.","This was quite an enjoyable class. Not only is it fundamental for every mathematician to learn, but the material taught is some of the most beautiful and surprising elementary material in mathematics. The big results are mostly simple to state, but unbelievable. Many of the computation techniques learned are useful in other fields."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.90","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"18","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 213a","course_id":"2878","cat_num":"1621","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 213a","course_id":"2878","cat_num":"1621","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 213a","course_id":"2878","cat_num":"1621","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"8","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
