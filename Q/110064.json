Developmental cognitive neuroscience is an incredibly exciting emerging field, and Professor Somerville does a wonderful job not only at introducing the most relevant topics pertaining the adolescent brain, but also at generating enthusiasm for the field. The class has a great balance between lecture and class discussion, allowing the students not only to get a solid picture of the specific topics, but also to share our thoughts and perspectives on them. The weekly discussion posts really encourage you to read the assigned papers critically, and the final paper is a great way to focus on a subject of interest."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.00","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"25.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1355","course_id":"11094","cat_num":"30065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1355","course_id":"11094","cat_num":"30065","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1355","course_id":"11094","cat_num":"30065","1s":"2","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
