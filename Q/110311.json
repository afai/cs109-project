His approach to music will open your eyes in ways you haven't imagined and it's awesome to have him performing and giving lectures around campus now that he's a faculty member.","This is a cool survey of African American improvised musics taught by the great Vijay Iyer! Be prepared to get deep into issues around culture, race, experience and music cognition as well as challenge yourself to be a better musician and human.","I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to take this class before graduating. For me, this class made me cognizant of the possibilities for community organizing at Harvard\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalbeit, on a very small scale\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwithin the improvising musical community, and also across the boundaries of musical and extramusical approaches to artmaking. The regular critiques with Vijay weren't prescriptive or heavy-handed, but were instead conversations and discussions about the approaches taken by the artist and possibilities for expanding beyond or varying what he or she's already been exploring. Watching this process unfold in a series of engaging questions and reflective responses was eye-opening. I also enjoyed the readings and the brilliantly curated weekly listening\/watching playlists.","It seems silly to be writing one of these anonymous CUE blurbs for this class, because you're probably not going to come across this course unless you know about it already, in which case, you should absolutely take it, because to miss the opportunity would be a mistake. We are very lucky to have VIjay here. Take advantage of it!","Prof. Iyer structured the class so to first place African American music within a historical and cultural context, which raised personal questions about our relationship to the music. From that point, we were able to develop personal priorities as artists.  I highly recommend if you are interested in personal reflection as an artist.","Every school with serious (jazz) musicians should offer this course. Classes within the Harvard Music Department analyze music from a historical and academic perspective. This course also gives one the chance to look at music from one who creates music and critically reflects on their role as an artist. Professor Iyer fosters a sense of community, and it is so incredibly refreshing.","It's wonderful that Professor Iyer is now at Harvard. This class is something the music department sorely needed.","This class is revolutionary. Vijay Iyer is an amazing professor, musician, and person and anyone should be glad of the opportunity to work with him in any capacity. This class also created a community of musicians at Harvard that care about the arts and working collaboratively on music. If you are a musician and want to meet other talented and motivated musicians and have the opportunity to have your thoughts and assumptions about music blown out of the water, take this class.","This isn't just a course for playing music.  It is a serious overhaul of beliefs (for many) about what it means to be an improviser and an artist, in relation to a tradition, a community, the human body... plenty of reading and thinking, as well as listening and playing.  A very special class.","Dude\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the professor is Vijay Iyer. You'll learn about awesome new ways of thinking about improvisation and music. TAKE THIS CLASS!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 173r","course_id":"11450","cat_num":"66684","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 173r","course_id":"11450","cat_num":"66684","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 173r","course_id":"11450","cat_num":"66684","1s":"0","2s":"11","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
