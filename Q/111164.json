'07":{"comments":["Best class I've taken here.  Morin is the best professor I've had.  It's hard and sometimes very frustrating, but at other times very illuminating rewarding, and COOL.  I loved special relativity.","Dr. Morin is a pretty cool guy; the study-group networks in this class are strong; the labs are a little tedious and boring; this class will probably give you an excellent foundation in basic physics.","The class is very good, but you have to really, really, really love physics, or else you won't have the motivation to put in all the work that is required to do well.","It's hard but is a very good class.","It was the best course I took for my first semester at Harvard.","Absolutely take this course if you'd like a challenging, informative course. But be aware that it's a significant time commitment.","This may be a difficult class, but you can't beat the professor. He knows what he's doing, he makes the class engaging, he's organized and available for help, and he's a sexy beast.","The material is interesting, and Professor Morin is great.  You will need to work on the problem sets.","I\u00c2\u00b4ve actually talked to other students. As a chem major, it\u00c2\u00b4s optional, and 11 suffices. However, I had heard that Morin was a better lecturer and that the class was interesting enough to take it instead of 11. However, I found lectures to be slow (irrelevant examples), and not useful enough (not enough problem solving strategies). And I think you truly have to be REALLY excited to take it and interested in physics becuase you need to want to spend time outside of class just doing problems and understanding.","Great class if you work hard. Go to Morin's office hours. They are EXTREMELELY helpful.","Professor Morin is one of the top science instructors I have ever had; he makes physics personable, non-intimidating, and interesting.  I came into this class with a fair amount of insecurity about physics, and 15a made me enjoy the subject after having earned new confidence.","its so challenging but you realize your potential and as my friend says, if you fail, at least you \"fail in style\".. i mean, its physics :)","If you're willing to put in the time on the work, this is class is worth taking.  You will learn a lot and will have an enjoyable class experience along the way.","if your interested in physics this is a great course to take - I wouldn't recommend it for others unless they had a strong interest in physics.","Only for those interested in the subject and willing to put some time into the course.","Attend lecture and pay attention; you'll get a decent grade and learn things too.","Professor cares about his class","If you're excited about physics, try for 16, not this one.  If physics is a secondary hobby for you and you don't want to do the time commitment of 16, this course is good.","The course is a rigorous introduction to mechanics.  This class should not be taken for fun or as a science core.  Interest in the material is essential.","It's challenging, even if you've taken advanced physics classes before.","You absolutely should have taken AP physics before this class, or be prepared to spend extra time than your classmates trying to make this make sense.","If you have a good study group with whom to work on the problem sets, the homework for this course is so much fun. It is challenging and interesting but not so hard that you get really frustrated with it.","I would like them to know that it really is a lot of work and if they want to do well they should prepare to spend a lot of time on the course.","It's very difficult, the homework is unfair and you are never prepared for it, and it's too much material for you to really understand it while you're busy working on last week's problem set.","It's hard, but it's manageable.","Students who have had an AP Physics C class should really shop Physics 16 before considering Physics 15a. On the other hand, those who aren't very good with math and unwilling to do problem sets should probably look at Physics 11a.","Great class if you are genuinely interested in physics","Be ready to work very hard.","Take this class early on because it might turn you into a physics concentrator.","It's a great way to start off the study of physics -- engaging, interesting, challenging.","Only if you really like physics, or a challenge. There are easier ways to fulfill whatever requirement this is working for. But Morin is a nice professor to experience.","You will spend more time on the problem sets that you'd think","It's a very manageable and enjoyable class that really depends heavily on the teaching strengths of Professor Morin.","if you want to continue to take physics or classes with physical applications then this is a great class, but if this is the only physics you're taking you should probably take ps 2, 3 because the applications are less direct and its harder to see why what we're learning is important","This is a great course with an excellent professor. I would definitely suggest that you take it only if you like physics because it does require you to work. Definitely try to keep up with the course and go through lecture notes the weekend before. It helps a lot to make lecture more productive. If you do that, you really do not need to do the readings. Definitely attend physics problem set night in leverett, it helps your grade out a lot!","You'll feel comfortable in this course if you have enough physics background (e.g. AP-level mechanics), as the course reviews basic concepts at a fast pace. Be prepared to work through problems requiring computational ingenuity, but they're well worth the effort. I believe the course is rewarding largely because it fosters that ingenuity in solving problems.","Start problem sets several days before they are due.  Go to the Leverett dining hall Wednesday night to get help on the homework.  Use the solutions from previous years' homework to help you.","The class is difficult and not very intriguing.  I think probably either challenging oneself to take 16 or dropping down to 11 is a smarter idea.","This is an excellent class.  You will learn a great deal about physics and mechanics.  The professor is enthusiastic and makes it enjoyable to learn the material.  Of course, it is also a challenging course.  Be prepared for a great deal of work, but know that it will pay off in the end.","The course takes a good amount of effort, but is well worth it.  It provided a solid background in mechanics and relativity and provided information on the complicated math behind the formulas without taking the focus away from practical, applicable physics.  The large number of demonstrations make this class interesting and fun as well as informative on the subject.","Difficult but rewarding","Lectures are really fun and problem sets are great!","It is quite a difficult class, but worth it. It is a good class to take if you are debating whether or not to major in physics.","ITS GONNA BE HARD"]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["This class is amazing. I disliked physics in high school, but 15a turned out to be my favorite course this semester.","This class is extremely challenging, but you learn a lot.  I think it's definitely worthwhile.","A well taught and interesting class.","Physics 15a is nice.. but why take it? You basically don't learn much more than what you would learn from taking Physics 11a; maybe you would learn at what angle two pencils will stand still. Who cares?? No.. it doesn't expand your scope of thinking.","not too mathematically difficult and a very clear lecturer who'll help you understand the material","Overall, this was a very good course that was well run.  The professors and TFs were willing to help, and I feel I learned a good basis of physics.","Only take it if you are willing to work very hard.","Liking physics is not enough.","The course is very hard, and will require 20+ hours a week if you want to do well, because on the exams you are expected to answer question in ridiculously short times.","This class really makes physics interesting. The lectures are engaging, and the problems, though difficult, are creative and thought-provoking.","It's really difficult, but a fun class.  Prepare for bad grades if not a science person.","The class was really interesting, I learned a lot, but it's very difficult so be ready to work. It's hard, but rewarding.","Don't schedule early-morning classes on Thursday.","The teaching staff is very friendly and care about the success of each student.","This class is much, much harder than physics 11a.  It should only be taken if you really enjoy physics or do not have a choice, as it will take a very long time to complete the problem sets and understand the material.","It's a lot of work, but for some reason pretty fun and interesting.","Take this class only if you already feel confortable with basic physics and are willing to put at least 5 hours a week of extra time outside of class, section, and lab.","Professor Morin's lectures are some of the most entertaining ones I have ever been in, but they were informative too. The problem sets and exams were challenging, but it's not too hard to get a good grade if you work at it.","There are few courses where you get to watch the trajectory of a small cannon hit a falling stuffed animal. Because of the great demos, the journeys through problem sets, and the great professors, this class is an enjoyable and memorable experience.","If you are confident that physics is for you take this course. If not, take Physics 11 first to see how college physics agrees with you.","If you want a challenging introduction to physics, then this is the class for you.  Make sure you have a solid background in calculus and you are able handle the material.  This is the hardest class I took in my freshman year, harder than any of the Math 21 classes.","Make sure that you go to the Wednesday night study sessions in Leverett. I worked on the problem sets by myself, or just with my roommate for most of the semester, and although I didn't do terrible on them, most of the other students in the class got perfect or close to perfect scores. Then I found out that all the people who were doing so well went to Leverett D-hall each Wednesday night, where Prof. Morin and the other students would help A LOT with the p-sets."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Good course for those who like physics and want to be challenged, but don't want to be bogged down with work.","Take if Morin is teaching (and you like physics!), DEFINITELY DO NOT TAKE IF SAMUEL IS TEACHING,","excellent teaching, interesting material, challenging","Take it if Morin is teaching it and you have a real interest in physics.","If you are pre-med, do not take this course unless you are extremely ambitious (as my junior friends and I were).  But there is no doubt that you'll really LEARN physics. Which I will appreciate","You should make use of Morin's office hours, he's a very nice guy!","difficult yet satisfying, you will learn a lot","This class is a lot of fun, the teachers are great, and while the homework and exams are not easy, by any means, they pay off. It's fun to succeed at the homework, and to finally understand a concept you've been struggling with.","The class is a decent amount of work, but Professor Morin is a brilliant professor and you learn a lot.","Take the course when Morin teaches it.","Difficult but with great resources","Finish the psets ahead of time. Make use of the book. the key to this course is the problems. If you can do problems, then you're all set.","If you have previously been well introduced to calculus based physics than this course is fine.  However, if you have not taken such a course, or rather taken a non-calculus physics, be prepared to introduce yourself to a new way of thinking that will require a great deal of work.","take it if Morin teaches it! love him, he's AMAZING","Be prepared to work hard.","If you enjoy physics, take it.  However, be warned: it's hard.  Don't be fooled by the first lecture.","I would recommend this course to students who are willing to work VERY VERY hard. Concepts take a while to be solidified.","You will be challenged to work very hard, but you will learn a great deal about physics.","Don't take this course unless you have a very strong physics background, otherwise you will be lost and not like physics as much, which is unfortunate.","Take this only if you're willing to work hard.","Physics 15a is demanding and it requires a great deal of effort to master the material, but you will end up with a greater aptitude for physics and improved problem solving skills.","You learn a lot and will enjoy the lectures, but it is is hard class. It will take up a lot of time and mental effort to do the problem sets and prepare properly for the exams.","This class is difficult and time-consuming but very fun","This class will make you love physics.","Only take this class if you have taken physics in the past, do not take this class cold.","only take as  concentration and if you're ready to put a lot of time into the class","Only if you are smart.","Be prepared to work really hard but learn a ton and have a lot of fun!!","An amazing class - if you don't mind working fairly hard.  There is a lot of help offered if you're struggling, but you'll have to look for it.","This is a very good class for those interested in the sciences. It may be too difficult for an elective class for those studying the humanities.","Do not take this class unless you have a really good background in physics and are willing to take the time to understand the very convoluted textbook and lecture notes.  I did only okay on the topic that I knew from the past and did TERRIBLE on the topics that were new to me.  The sections are the only useful thing, but as the semester went on I got the vibe that even my section leader had a hard time with the problem set problems.","The material learned is fairly basic (high-school level, mostly); what makes the course hard is the complexity of the problems. That is to say, this course is physics for prospective engineers, not physicists (who would presumably enjoy Physics 16 more).","Hard.  Worth it.  Pray that Morin lives forever.","Good class if you're good at physics","The best introductory class to mechanics and relativity that you will ever find. THe subject matter is presented in an exciting, engaging manner, and different more complex aspects of topics you may have covered in high are explored. Relativity is particularly fascinating, and is taught in an entirely accessible manner.","It was a good course in physics, I was glad that it presented me with a challenge as I feel that I better understand physical concepts as a result.","Avoid the temptation to do the problem sets on the last night; you won't learn the material as well. Morin is a great teacher, I think Samuel has yet to prove himself-although he was given the most technical material to lecture on, so it's kind of hard to tell.","Need to have taken a year of physics and be in math 21a. Also only take if you need for concentration.","Be prepared for tough problems, but also be prepared to learn a lot from them.","Very good class,but you'll have to work hard.","This course is very well structured. If you put in the time, you will not fall through the cracks.","though this class is hard, the community atmosphere, professor morin, and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with the work is unbeatable!","Be prepared to work hard, but it is worth it in the end.","Take this course only if you are extremely comfortable with introductory mechanics.","I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Physics, especially if they do not mind working hard on interesting problems!","The class is not easy. Some concepts, especially relativity, require a good deal of thought to understand them, and the problem sets are time consuming. However, the TFs and professors are approachable and helpful, and the class is ultimately very rewarding. I learned a tremendous amount of physics in a semester.","This is probably one of the best, most challenging classes offered at Harvard.  Be prepared to work hard, but reap the benefits as well.","better than 11a for sure... but it's not easy and not fun if you don't like physics","This class is so boring.  Unless you find physics just super fascinating, stay away.  I took this for a core, and it was a big mistake.  Also, if you've already taken AP Physics C Mechanics, be prepared to be ultra-super-mega bored because, aside from relativity and the final lecture, there is no new material."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Although this course is rigorous and way harder than an \"introduction\" to physics should be, I'd say it is absolutely worth it after all is said and done.","Be prepared to work hard; this is not an easy course.  However, if you love physics and put in the time, it is worth it and will be a great experience for you.","take it! yea!","Aravi MAKES this course. He is great, and the overall experience is terrific.","This is a fantastic physics class.  Professor Samuel is one of the best professors I've ever had.  Also, Leverett night is amazing.","Aravi is adorable.","If you think physics is interesting and want to learn a little bit about quantifying how the world works, Physics 15a is a great option, just be prepared to work hard and be wary if you haven't any prior experience with Physics.","It is a lot of fun! Just get past the problem sets and ENJOY lecture!","A good course, one that you need to take to get into more interesting physics.","It's a good class, but it's really hard.","While this course is a challenging and demanding introduction to mechanics, it is probably the most  fun I've had during a class; lectures were entertaining and there is plenty of help available.","This course does indeed provide a good and necessary introduction to mechanics and special relativity. However, considering the sub-par textbook, as well as the unrealistically difficult problem sets, I considered it a difficult class and that you just have to bite the bullet and get through it.","This is a wonderful course if you have a strong physics background. But it's easy to get lost if you don't have adequate preparation.","It's tempting to wait until \"physics night\" to do the problem sets, but it's more helpful to start earlier. Practice is worth it. Use the office hours.","Take this if you like physics. It's a required course so you probably will anyway.","Very fun, take it!","If you enjoy physics, it's great.  Especially because of professor Samuel.","The class is very interesting, and everyone is given the best opportunity to both do well grade wise and understand the material.","Take this course, but keep firmly in mind that University Physics is no longer high school physics and adjust your work habits accordingly.","If you have to take physics. Otherwise, skip it.","This class is a lot of fun and pushes your conceptual understanding of physics to a higher level.","If you want to learn physics, and are ready to put in the necessary time, then Physics 15a is the ideal class to take.","Lectures are really fun. Plan to spend all night on Wednesdays doing your problem set, but make sure to go do it at Leverett with your fellow students - it's actually kind of fun.","If you can dedicate the time to do the work, then this course is great because the professor and TF's are really helpful.","The problems are great and the professor is a great person. It is very important to have a solid mechanics background before taking this course - to be perfectly honest I probably wouldn't have learned too much from lecture if I didn't already remember most of the material, particularly in the first half of the course. There are many nuances - e.g. under what conditions different relativity conditions can be applied, how certain things are defined, etc. - that are not explicitly pointed out in class, which can easily lead to confusion if there is not a conscious effort to think everything through. In this respect the textbook is generally quite helpful. But overall I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to people with the right background and an enthusiasm for physics.","Although this class requires extensive amounts of time and energy, it was immensely rewarding and easily my favorite class of the semester despite my difficulties with the material and my ineptitude as Physics. The small class size of Spring Semester was a definite benefit and was really influential in my understanding and comprehension of course material. If you have any interest in Physics and some prior knowledge, I would emphatically recommend this course."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["The problem sets aren't too hard to do in one night on your own, as long as you are okay with making a few mistakes here and there. Professor Morin is a great lecturer and engages the whole class. The tests are hard if you are unprepared, but with some studying it isn't too hard to get well above the mean.","Start the psets on the weekends. I repeat.\r\n\r\nStart\r\non\r\nthe\r\nweekends.\r\n\r\nAnd find a study group that works on the psets before the night before they're due.","Even a 5 on AP Physics B isn't enough preparation for this course.","Take it if you have to and are willing to work hard to learn the material. I would not recommend it for someone who only wants to learn some physics for fun or personal background.","It is a hard class that requires a lot of time, but totally worth it!!","Physics 15a was a solid introductory mechanics course. If you take this course, you should definitely form a study group as it is always more enjoyable with friends at your side!","The problem sets and exams are challenging but all the teaching staff are so helpful, especially Prof. Morin with his daily office hours.  Physics can be really fun, but try to get started on the problem sets early so you can ask the TFs or Prof. Morin questions. The class also encourages group work and section is very important for learning how to solve problems, since lecture covers mostly concepts.  The demos are hilarious and make you think about the world in new ways.  For example, without friction, something could move to anywhere else on the world within 42 minutes...","David Morin is amazing! Go to office hours, work the problem sets with your peers. Do as many problems as possible for review.","Look, this course is not by any means easy.  Find a study group, work together.  Psets are too hard to do by yourself if you expect to ace them by yourself.  That said, there is definitley something rewarding about struggling through something and finally understanding it.  That's how i feel at the end of this course.  Would I want to do all that work again? No.  But am i really glad that i did? YES","David Morin is an incredible teacher. Make sure you take a lot of practice tests before the exam. Even though you think you know the material cold, you don't truly know it until you can apply it to lots of problems.","it's difficult, but a really good class","Work in groups, but make sure to understand the material on your own.","take it only if you have a solid physics background from high school","Be prepared to work VERY hard. This is a great class but can consume a majority of your time if you don't plan out  your time well","I am happy with my decision to take Physics 15a over Physics 16 - even though I probably could have done well in the latter, I much preferred the problem-solving approach of 15a to the more abstract, conceptual approach of 16.  That being said, the class is pretty difficult, even for someone with an AP Physics C background - you will definitely be challenged even if you have previous exposure to the topics covered in the course.","Dr. Morin is absolutely worth your time. As long as you're ready to complete your fair share of work and listen in class, you will do really well...AND have fun! WOAH.","Requires a substantial time commitment, but will vastly improve your analytical and problem solving skills. Probably a good basis for future study in physics; not particularly applicable to anything else (except for my awesome double-spring block-rope-pulley-on-a-plane machine that I've just been dying to take on a train moving at 4c\/5...)","If you really like physics and have had a fair amount of exposure to it you will enjoy this course, if not it can be hell","This class will take a good deal of effort, but afterwards, you will have a much better understanding of mechanics.","This class is a great way to learn mechanics regardless of your other academic interests. Morin is a superb teacher who gives interesting clear lectures.","This course requires a lot of work, but you will get out as much as, if not more than, you put into it. The quality of the course is definitely worth the extra work, provided that you have time in your schedule.","This is a rigorous course that requires a lot of time, but teaches you a lot about the physical world and its peculiarities.","Excellent overview of mechanics.","Makes you being a better problem solver which is extremely useful. DJM and TFs are awesome","Great lectures and interesting material","Make sure you have enough time to work on the home AND understand it!","This is an excellent introduction to Mechanics and you will definitley learn a great deal. However I would advise caution since it is quite difficult.","If you want to learn how things work and be awesome, take this course. It takes lots of practice to do well but it is always worth it. I strongly recommend this.","You get to see things explode and your professor climb up to the ceiling which is pretty amazing. This class is taught really well with concepts being highlighted through limericks and stunts, but the problem sets are hard and meant to make you think. Work in groups, but also remember to work alone on the problems as well.","It's a really challenging course. I thought I would have adequate preparation and an easier time having a year or two of physics before college, but the extent and depth of the material covered is quite surprising.","This class is definitely great for anybody interested in physics and the sciences. It is taught well, and you will vital problem solving skills that will be vital in future classes and beyond.","I feel like I learned more from the other students than from lecture\/the professor\/the TFs. I wish I'd taken AP Physics in high school; I think the background might have been helpful. If you don't understand the first and\/or second homework because you realize you don't know how to apply the material from the lectures\/don't understand the lectures, go buy the supplemental textbook, because the lectures are likely to be almost straight out of the required textbook. If you realize you're in over your head, don't forget you can always drop the course or switch to another Physics course. If you have to stick with 15a, don't be too proud to ask for help, e.g., a tutor. Go to Leverett dining hall on Wednesday nights to check homework.  It's worth it no matter how far you have to walk. Go through the old exams before your midterms (yes, all of them if you can manage it). Be careful about scheduling your lab time because almost every lab ran over three hours. (On that note, this class eats up more time than you think it will.) I wouldn't recommend this course unless you like physics or have to take it for a concentration requirement.","It'll be worth it in the end, but it's extremely difficult.  Make sure you utilize all the TFs and office hours.","This class is amazing. The problem sets can get frustrating at times, but you learn a lot, the demos are really cool, and Prof. Morin is a wonderful lecturer.","Physics 15a is a great class. Although difficult and time consuming, you will learn a lot about mechanics and will most likely especially enjoy special relativity. Perhaps above all, your problem solving skills will definitely improve from solving lots of cool problems on the problem sets. Professor Morin is also an excellent teacher and gives clear and concise lectures that well summarize the textbook. He is also easily accessible in office hours.","As a fairly challenging physics class, this is one submerged in an environment more than likely encouraging, horizon-expanding, and fun. Definitely consider this, even if physics is not your concentration.","Take this class if you really wanna learn physics, have some experience at the AP level, but want a more foundational approach then Physics 16. You can do phenomenally well in this class if you have the right TF, go to office hours with the TF and Morin, and do everything ahead of time so you have lots of time to think about the concepts. Really, it's a great class and Morin is one of the best teachers I've ever had, but doing well is really about time management and taking advantage of the resources at your disposal.","It's tough and takes a lot of time, but it's a good class and you'll learn a lot.","This course is very time consuming and fairly difficult. There were several students that dropped it or dropped down to Physics 11 because of these factors. However, if you enjoy physics and meeting a very cool professor, I recommend it.","Come, ye eager minds, and be amazed by physics","This course seems to be meant mainly for physics concentrators.  If you enjoy physics I would recommend it, but if it is to fulfill a requirement, I would recommend 11a.","The class is certainly challenging, especially because the grade rests on your performance on the mid-terms.  The material is pretty easy to grasp; spend a lot of time on how to work out problems.","If you want to do well in this class and aren't a math\/physics god, you will have to devote a LOT of time to it. Go to Morin's office hours: he's super nice and helpful, and they will save you a lot of frustration. Also, you will get used to the difficulty of the problem sets, and none will feel as bad as the first few weeks'.","As a premed always looking for more ways to seem hardcore, I do not regret taking this course. I realized I missed out on the stuff PS2 talks about, like Brownian motion or fluids, that I would find more interesting to my future studies than relativity. But this course was a really good mental exercise. It's good to know that you can handle it.","really a lot of fun, defniately take 15a when morin is teaching it. the demos are amazing and the problems are really cool.","Be ready to spend lots of time on your psets!","In this class, you learn so many useful things.","Be prepared to work hard.","if you want a good physics class, take this","Not too hard, and a much better alternative to 11a.","This is a great physics course, but it is extremely tough. Only take it if you are interested in concentrating in physics or a related field.","It is more difficult than you might originally think.","Even if it's hard, I have friends who switched out into 11a and were not happy with their decision, so tough it out and see how it goes","Quite an intro to the authentic college Physics experience.","Take this course in the fall--Professor Morin is awesome, and he'll keep you interested in physics long after the problem sets are done.","This is an extremely difficult class. Allot at least an hour or 2 per problem on the problem sets.","its hard.","This course was very well organized. The professor is an awesome person. This class also had in-class demonstrations which were entertaining and amazing. If you like physics, then you will most likely like this course. There was homework, but it definitely was not too bad, especially if you collaborated with people or went to Leverret House P-set night. As a side note, the labs were interesting but kind of long.","This course provides a solid foundation for mechanics.  Even after taking physics in high school, I wanted to make sure I got that foundation.  And it covered so much more beyond what any high school course can offer.","A very well taught course and will definitely increase your interest in physics.","It is well taught and organized. You cover many physics concepts. Fairly difficult - if looking for an easier class physics 11a may be a better choice.","I got a 5 on the AP Physics C exam and still found this class challenging. If you're not sure about whether to take Physics 16 or 15a, I think you should strongly consider 15a and not think of it as just an easy class.","Only take this if you're willing to invest a lot of time working to understand concepts and solve problem sets."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["You've got to be able to take in information in section and figure out what you actually need.  Unfortunately, that's not really what section is supposed to be about.","Very intellectually stimulating, but can be a blow to your gpa if you don't have a good background in physics..","As someone who sort of enjoys physics but isn't crazy about it, I sort of enjoyed this course, so someone who really likes physics will probably like it a lot. There are a few aspects of it that are annoying-- try to get a good and helpful TF, and you may want to see if you can get to know both the professor that teaches the class in the one who teaches the other term a little bit before taking it (maybe by shopping this class and a class that the other prof is teaching at the same time?). This is a requirement introductory course, so it's a little impersonal, but the material is pretty good and the problem sets are challenging. Try to read the book and lecture notes unless you feel like they aren't helping.","The demos are loads of fun. Take this class in the spring.","Be careful if you are completely new to physics, as the course does move quickly for those with no previous knowledge.  If you took AP Physics, you are SET, and will not really have to work hard at all.  The problem sets feature more difficult problems than you would have done in high school though, so it is not boring or a waste of time.  They are manageable and do not take that much time, however, which is nice.  Exams are not that terrible, and there are a lot of opportunities to raise your grade if you do poorly.  The demonstrations are AMAZING, Professor Samuel sets something on fire basically every lecture, usually for no real reason.  At one point he raised himself to the ceiling using a pulley and at another point he had someone break a cement block sitting on top of him with a sledgehammer as he lay on a bed of nails.  There was also an incident involving an explosive helium balloon floating to the ceiling and hovering dangerously close to a light.  Also we watch a lot of Youtube.  It's awesome.","Although I have been told that Physics 15a is an excellent introduction to mechanics, my experience in this class tells me otherwise.  Perhaps it is because the teaching staff this year is atypical -- this is the one semester in which the course was not taught by David Morin.  The pedagogy of the class that I took was, at times, simply awful: psets were sloppy, and lectures and problems had little association.  A look at class material from previous 15a classes reveals that these issues do not seem to define the course historically.  However, as I cannot make a recommendation based on a class I didn't take, I must speak only for this one, and I would not recommend taking the class that I took: your class, however, might be different.","Be ready for a tough course, but its rigor arises from its strong coverage of a variety of subjects in mechanics, as well as special relativity.","Don't take this class unless you want to concentrate in physics.  I did very well in physics in high school, but I wasn't prepared for this in the least and a lot of my peers feel the same way.  Labs are cool, but my gpa will suffer as a result of taking this class. If you do take it and have my background, read the supplementary book outside of class","The subject matter is really interesting and I learned a tremendous amount, although it was one of the most intensive classes I've ever taken. While classes like math21a spoon-feed the material, physics 15a assumes that students will teach themselves by way of the problem sets.","WORK WITH PEOPLE. Don't put doing practice problems til the end of the class; do book problems versus practice tests, which are not always like the test questions. Prof Samuel is a good professor.","Hard but not that hard, generally interesting, challenging, overall a good experience.","Go to Physics Night.","A very interesting course. Take only if willing to devout 7+ hours for each PSET.","hard. but do 16 instead.","The class is difficult, and quite a departure from high school science classes. Unless you're a physics whiz, you'll have to work hard and probably won't experience spectacular success, as you're in a class full of physics, astrophysics, math, and applied math concentrators. However, you'll get to meet some great classmates and get inducted into grown-up style problem solving, which might be worth all the work.","DO NOT take this class for kicks. If you do take the class, print out David Morin's notes prior to lecture and review them. Then go over them again afterwards. Solve lots of practice problems and remember strategies for certain types. It can be a rewarding course, but the range in experience\/ability is huge and if you don't stay on top of the work you can quickly find yourself falling behind.","Prof. Samuel is awesome! Even if the fall students like Morin, Prof. Samuel is a really good teacher as long as you don't mind being out of sequence. However, be careful with which TF you have.","The work isn't easy, but the class was definitely worth it!","It's hard!!","Are you good at physics? Do you love physics? IS it possible that you might have to take this class? If your answer is no for any of these, then don't take this class. If you have yes for all three, then make sure that you stay on top of the material being taught. Get another book from the library and try to do as many practice problems as possible. Also, get to know the professor more. He is incredibly helpful and nice, if he knows that you care about this class.","Only take this class if you need to","Physics 15a is a fun class and a no-brainer if you're considering any kind of a math\/physics track. Excellent labs and homeworks and fair exams.","Only take this course if you have to\/ if you enjoy this stuff. It's very hard to solve problems or do well on the exams because you are never given a deep understanding of the material.","It's tough, but if you put in the work to understand the material, it's absolutely worth it.","This course is fantastic for anyone who took physics in high school and is interested in breaking into the field further. Aravi is fantastically nice and an excellent, clear teacher.","Make sure you get a good section leader!  Shop both sections and see which section leader's style suits you.","It's a fair class.","If you don't really like math and problem solving or like other subjects better then don't take this course.","This class is really hard, take it seriously. I took AP mechanics in high school and thought I already knew all the material. As a result, I didn't try that hard for the first midterm and my score reflected that. However, if you put in the required effort, this course is very rewarding. Relativity is awesome!","Do your psets with friends!  It definitely helps alleviate the pain.","This course gives you a very firm grounding in classical mechanics through extensive problem sets and well-designed lectures. It is a challenging course but entirely fulfilling.","if you don't have a strong background in physics, take a second to think about whether or not you really want to do this. that said, it's not impossible without one.","Get the textbook and read it.  Do practice problems. Read around the subject. All of these things will boost your enjoyment and competence for the course.","The class covers almost the same material as the AP physics C test, plus special relativity. The problems on problem sets are somewhat harder than ones from the AP, however. The course is challenging in that sense, but doable enough (the tests are somewhat hard, though).","This course is not good, take it in the Fall so it is with Morin and not Samuel. His lectures were so unfocused and often just spent watching him do demos (which I admit were cool although he also almost killed himself like 5 times doing various demos) and trying to derive equations that didn't really needed to be derived. I really loved physics before this class but I gotta say spring 15a left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't take it with Samuel unless you have to...really...","Do not take it concurrently with two other problem set classes. It is very, very challenging if you don't have as much preparation in math and physics as other students.","If you didn't take any physics in highschool, don't take this course. I didn't, and I found the course very very difficult. It's not impossible, but if you don't have a good physics background I suggest you take Physics 11a instead."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["It is extremely hard","If you want to get physics just out of the way some other course might be better for you. BUT if you want to actually learn, have exciting demos, and have a great challenging time Physics 15a is right for you!","Make sure you're ready for this course, that you have both a solid basis in calculus, trigonometry, AND high school physics. I was hesitant about my basis, and still took the course, and I have to say I had a lot of trouble with it. Freshmen, I'm talking to you. Be sure of yourselves, don't be too proud. On a brighter note: Special relativity is FUN.","It teaches you good physics and makes sure you understand it. The midterms are pretty hard and most of the labs are boring, but I assume that that's the nature of an introductory mechanics course.","This is a good class, but if you've already taken physics before, a lot of it might be repeat","The class is really well-taught and well-run.  Morin is a great lecturer and provides limericks and demos in class.  It's a pretty enjoyable way to take mechanics, and you'll learn a lot, too.","awesome class but its hard.","It's hard, but very rewarding.","It's hard. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on it.","This class is hard and takes a lot of time. I took this as an elective and I wouldn't recommend doing that as it is taught for engineers and physicists. I took physics C in high school but often felt overwhelmed in this class. The material is interesting and Morin is great, just be prepared to work.","probably the most rewarding class I took","The lectures may seem basic, but it's important to stay on top of what's being covered--it will make the psets and exams much easier.","Course is challenging but very manageable.  There are lots of resources for help when you need help.","Only take this class with friends because unless you're great at physics, you will need a lot of help.","TAKE IT! RAWR!","Dr. Morin isn't the world's most inspiring lecturer, but it's a solid class that you'll learn a lot from.","Don't underestimate this class. First few lectures can be deceiving in terms of difficulty. Do practice problems.","This course provides a solid introduction to physics. If you are deciding between 15a and 16, know that 15a still requires a decent amount of work, but it hopefully will not drive you crazy. If you are deciding between 15a and 11a, take 15a. 11a is not even that much easier, and 15a is so much better taught and organized that it is worth whatever additional time might be required of you.","This course is hard and a lot of work, but well worth it. David Morin is the man, and there are so many fun demos in lecture! Section is also very helpful and the section TF's are excellent.","This is a very challenging class, but is extremely well taught and organized.  Professor Morin clearly cares about making sure all the students understand the material and is very accessible during office hours.  There are a lot of resources to help you understand the material, but you must be willing to put in a lot of time puzzling through problems on your own to do well.","This class is actually not that hard. I just dug myself into a hole because of one silly mistake on a test that cost me a whole bunch of points. Just practice practice practice doing the practice problems for the tests. If you do all of them, you will have seen most of the possible problem types and will not have that much trouble on the tests. The problem solutions are straightforward once you think about it, so just don't go to bed 4 hours before an exam, and you will be fine.","Even if you are just fulfilling a requirement, take this class over the other mechanics classes, the professors and TFs make it worth the effort!","Take this class if you are not sure whether you want to do physics in college or not.  Section was really helpful, as was going to physics night on wednesdays.  Office hours with Morin are useless, because he doesn't really help you answer the question.  Lecture is useful to see the demos, but other than that Morin does nothing except re-create the lecture notes posted online, word for word.  the midterms are wicked hard, but don't get discouraged if you get a bad grade, because there is a huge curve.  Know that the answers to most problem set questions are posted on the website if you know where to look, so there really is no reason to get less than an A with each problem set.","This is a difficult course that requires a substantial time commitment.","This class is tougher than 11a but it is worth it!! Every part of this class is amazing, from Morin to all of his wonderful TFs.","I enjoyed all of Physics 15a except for three days--the two midterms and the final.  The lectures are enjoyable (especially the awesome demos!) and psets are very reasonable.  But the problems on the exams are no less involved than those on the psets, except that you have to solve them by yourself and three times as fast as you would otherwise.","Focus on problem solving,but do read the book before going to class. PLEASE. Do PSETS *ALONE* before going into office hours. Meet up with Professor Morin BEFORE your mid-terms to discuss study strategies.","This class is not an easy class, but you will learn a lot.  The work load is not too heavy, but they work you are given is quite challenging.  I would only take this course if you know you like physics.  Otherwise, you will not enjoy the class.","Great class, overall.  It will not take over your life like Phys 16 will.","Take this class if you have a decent background in physics and math and be ready for a significant amount of work per week. It is not unmanageable by any means, but do not put the problem sets off until the last night. Go to office hours and get help from other students, the TFs, and the professor. It is an easy course if you put the time in.","...it's doable!  Just be prepared to spend time on the material.","It's great! It's a kind of big lecture class, but I felt like I got to know a lot of people and make friends through lab, section, office hours, and especially physics night. The class goes very quickly, so it helps to review lectures notes both before and after class. David Morin is great - he's a good teacher, he's very approachable, and he writes great limericks. I also found the material really cool. The class was not easy, but was a great experience in general.","This class is great! Dr. Morin is an awesome professor, not only are his lecture notes really helpful but he holds office hours basically everyday. There are only 5 labs, but some of them are a bit tedious. Overall though you learn a lot and you understand physics a lot better afterwards. Just be prepared to work.","The lecture notes are excellent.","Professor Morin is awesome. In class he gives clear lectures and demos that are just too good to miss (he even risks hurting himself several times). Outside of class, during his office hour, he is like a caring tutor who literally sits down and teaches you any problem you have until you understand it. The lab component is probably the only weakness, because it tends to take up too much time. The exams are fairly difficult, and sometimes even you do a lot of practice problems, you will still freeze on the exams. But do your best, work hard, ask questions and you should be fine.","It is a lighter workload than physics 16, but you should be ready to work. The problem sets routinely take 5-10 hours and the exams are quite difficult.","Physics 15a is intended for students who wish to pursue Physics as a concentration. Much dedication and time must be invested in this course for it to be fruitful, so please do not take this course while taking more than one other hard science or math class.","It is a great course to learn about classical mechanics.","AP Physics is almost a must. Doable without but far more painful.","Challenging but rewarding introduction to mechanics and relativity. Work to understand the underlying theory behind problems rather than memorizing solutions.","Make SURE you have enough time to take this class. DO NOT take it at the same time as another hard pset class unless you're planning to concentrate in physics or you are insane.","Unless you are\/plan to be a physics concentrator, do not take this course, especially if you are just trying to fulfill a Gen. Ed. The lectures are not very exciting or interesting, the problem sets are pretty difficult, the textbook is confusing, and the material is just not presented in a way that teaches it very well. I would say that a prior knowledge of physics is necessary because of the assumptions that were made about the class understanding the material very quickly.","This course is difficult, but Professor Morin is a really great professor. He always has lots of office hours and is willing to talk over certain problems with you if you are having issues with a problem set. His lectures also always include really cool demos. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in physics or science or engineering, but does not want to take a course like Physics 16.","A pretty difficult class, but ultimately rewarding in terms of the knowledge\/insights gained.","Don't come in expecting this course to be easy just because it's lower than Physics 16. The problems are still quite challenging and second midterm was brutal. Go to your professor's and section leader's office hours, because it takes a lot of explaining for these concepts to sink in.","The course was taught very well and the Section was great. The material was very interesting and interesting problems were created using them. Overall I had fun with this course even though it wasn't always Physics related fun.","I had never had physics before, and so this class was extremely difficult for me.  Most of the students seem to have taken AP physics, so if you haven't, be prepared to work much, much harder than the other students.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was unprepared for the class, I still learned a lot and Prof Morrin is amazing - great lectures and I had a great section too.","Spend a lot of time working through problem sets and practice problems and you'll do fine. And make sure you get Zach as your TF.","Great course, but be aware, it's going to require a lot more effort than high school physics did.","start the problem sets early so that you learn from them","great class!","This class is not easy but is definitely worth taking. If you get a good study group together (or are just really really good at physics) the problem sets aren't that bad. You just want to make sure you get a good TF, so if you don't, don't hesitate to switch. Also, Dr. Morin's lectures are pretty fun - he's awesome! Finally, the prelabs are a pain and a half and no one ever really knows how to do them, so get started on them early or ask your lab TFs for help. They're really nice.","This class is hard - even if you've already had AP mechanics in high school. Expect to work hard. But you will gain a much deeper understanding of mechanics.","Attend as many office hours as possible. Even though it might be possible to find solutions for some of the homework problems, working them out on your own is the best way to learn and practice.","This course is really hard.  You think you're prepared, but you're not.  If you have any reservations about 15a, listen to your gut and take 11a or PS2 instead.  Really.  I'm not kidding.","This class is more difficult than you think it will be.  It is certainly a great introduction to mechanics for any university.  Simply because Harvard offers a higher level introductory course does not mean this one will be any easier.  Ensure you work on the problem sets early, and understand each problem on your own, or you will be hurt for the exams.  Find study groups, and finish up the problem sets on your own.","This class is worth the effort.","Get ready to roll with the punches.","This is a good physics class. The problems are hard, so be prepared to think hard about them.","If you enjoyed physics in high school and want to get a stronger background before learning more, this class is perfect.","If you are comfortable with math and willing to put in a little time to review the material and work on the problem sets, you will get a lot out of this class and it shouldn't be too difficult.","This course is a solid introduction to mechanics. I understand very few people take this course as an elective or to satisfy Gened\/Core requirement, but even as a government concentrator I find it interesting sometimes. But to truly get the most out of the course you must be ready to put in a lot of work. \r\nFor me, experiment is a pain in the ass, as it always takes a lot of time, but once you treat it seriously, you feel intellectually rewarded.","This is a great class if you're into Physics - the organization of the course is great and the material is interesting. The problem sets are sometimes very challenging but there are a lot of people who can help you when you're stuck.","Fantastic class if you enjoy physics.","Only take this course if you are serious about studying physics.  If you want to take physics just for fun, take 11a.  Only take 15 or 16 if you want to study something that requires a good understanding of physics.","If you are a very fast learner, have a strong science background, and can learn material without every little thing explained to you, you will do fine in this class.","A challenging but accessible class for people who like physics. Professor Morin is a great teacher, explains concepts very clearly and provides lecture notes that are extremely helpful. Having taken high school physics (especially AP-level) is very, very helpful.","The problem sets are very difficult, with messy math (derivatives) required to solve the problems. If you are unable to solve a question after lecture and reading the textbook, your only options are going to inconveniently timed office hours or help from other student.s","you MUST be interested in physical problems and be willing to devote time to problem sets","I took AP physics B in high school and found this course extremely difficult.  Only take this class if you have a strong background in physics and a sincere interest in the subject.  Dr. Morin is a gives great lectures if you can follow along with the material, and his demonstrations are always spectacular.  Problem sets take between 6-10 hours to complete.  Take advantage of office hours; I wish I had."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Do as many practice exams as you can!","Physics 15a is a great course. Professor Morin is a great and funny lecturer who really knows how to teach and make you understand. Classes are engaging and interesting, there's at least one exciting demo in every lecture. The only thing that I didn't like that much were the labs, that were simply boring and repetitive. Nevertheless, it's a great class and definitely worth taking.","Fairly easy, yet still interesting for those who have already taken AP Physics C Mechanics, or equivalent, in high school. Problem sets were reasonable and had interesting questions to think about and there were cool demos in class. Trick to doing well is doing as many practice problems as possible. Tests were definitely a bit more challenging, but grading is generous. Final was very difficult.","Dr. Morin is great! I like his teaching style: just the right amount of humor. And limericks. I though the labs were fun. Rather than handing you a protocol or set of instructions, the instructors make you actually think about what's going on. Sometimes it's nice to feel actually confused.","This class is amazing! I came into 15a thinking I wouldn't really like physics that much, but the amazing teaching staff helped make physics enjoyable. Professor Morin and his limericks make lecture engaging, the lab staff make PSI interesting, and my TF made section very helpful. The problem sets are challenging but rewarding; start them early if you can. The midterms and final should be manageable if you make use of the 32047 years' worth of past exams on the course website. I came into this course with two years of high school physics (no AP) and multivariable calculus and found it difficult but entirely doable.","You don't have to be a physics concentrator to take this class, but you might not get much out of it if you aren't. The material goes fast and assumes some previous understanding (although relativity is just plain cool). Morin is great though and the demonstrations are awesome--you just have to be ready for a real challenge.","This course is very challenging. I took it without an AP Physics background and the first six weeks were very tough but doable. I recommend hiring a tutor from the BSC (it's a really good deal). If you want your money's worth from your Harvard education, then I recommend taking this course for your physics requirement rather than something that might be less rigorous.","The course promotes both conceptual understanding and computational proficiency, as it exposes students to some of the theories most fundamental to the way mankind conceives of the physical world. The problems are challenging and rewarding. Habits of thought, from the \"sanity check\" provided by checking limiting cases and units to the visual rendering of situations in simple drawings, will benefit me for the rest of my thinking life.","Do not take this class unless you are concentrating in Physics or have an undying love and devotion to the subject. It may be \"better taught\" than 11a, but the material is significantly much harder to fully comprehend unless you give this class your all. Do yourself a favor and avoid this class unless it is absolutely necessary. You're better off taking PS 1,2 and 3","It's a very difficult class to get through, however it is also very rewarding. Professor Morin is a great professor and you should definitely take advantage of his office hours - that's where a lot of complex concepts can really be made clear.","If you like physics, then take this class. It will be challenging and a time commitment, but it will be worth it.","This course is great, especially if you like physics. The labs are very rarely shorter than the three hour time slot, even though at first we were told they would be shorter sometimes. This course takes up a lot of time, between lab, lectures, section, and problem sets.","This is a hard class, so be prepared to work. But it will pay off.","It's a great class.  If you do all the work (as much as you can on your own) and spend some extra time on top of that working on practice problems, you'll be fine.","It's the best physics class I've ever taken by far.","This is a very difficult course but the key to doing well is tackling as many practice problems as necessary.","This class teaches the fundamentals of mechanics and relativity in a unique and engaging way! The material covered is thoroughly reinforced and tested through not only homework sets and exams but also entertaining demonstrations and independent critical thinking during labs.","If you want a solid knowledge of physics (maybe not a crazy theoretical knowledge like 16, and more than 11), this is the course for you. It's run really well, and Morin and the materials he wrote are great. The lab was also one of the most interesting I've had here. I definitely feel more solid tackling physical problems now, too.","It is a difficult class, but is the best class I have taken at Harvard so far.  Morin is an amazing professor, and the rest of the teaching staff is great as well.","Physics 15a is SO great. You will put a fair amount of work in, but it is never tedious and you feel like you're learning the whole time. I enjoyed studying for exams and doing the problem sets, so the time I spent on the course was time enjoyed. Lectures are well paced and fun, and the teaching staff is perhaps the best put together group at Harvard. I was nervous about taking this course because it was not required and I had heard it was hard (and I had no physics background), but it was totally worth it. I really honestly enjoyed taking this course!","If you want to really learn physics, then take this class!","This is possibly the best class I have taken at Harvard.  The problem sets are long, but rewarding and perfectly fair.  The staff bends over backwards to be available and both the TFs and the Professor are on hand to help out at physics night.  Amazing course.","It's difficult. Don't take too many other tough class at the same time. Morin is awesome and is extremely helpful.","Physics 15a is particularly good for an introductory concentration course.  I would not consider it that great for non-concentrators.  The work load is moderate but there office hours are plentiful and helpful and physics night in Lev is always there to pull you through.  If you are interested in concentrating in the sciences this course is a must (not only is it prolly required but the physics knowledge will certainly be helpful) but if History and Lit is your thing you might want to choose something else.  Also, if you do decide to take the course, make sure Morin is teaching it.","Physics 15a is a relatively difficult course by intro course standards, but I strongly recommend the 15 series if you have any interest in physics whatsoever.  The teaching staff is very helpful and will lead you through the difficult times (Wednesday nights).","Make sure to either: 1. have a detailed mechanics background beforehand or 2. Be willing to put in a lot of work to get up to par with the early material. Also take advantage of all the help sessions (especially in Lev) they really provide a lot of help if you need it","It's very challanging and very time consuming but also quite rewarding.","This course is a well organized and well thought out course. It is fun, and while it takes some work, it is not a hard course. However, that being said, the hours of class are very high, and lab is a time sink.","The class is very well taught.  The class is challenging enough to be interesting, without being frustrating.  I would highly recommend this class.","This class was amazing. It was taught very well, and theres so much support for anyone who needs help with the homework or material. I felt that if I was ever confused about an idea, the staff was ready to help me understand it. It has a great workload and you learn a lot by the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the sciences or math.","If you're not very interested in physics, this class is not for you","really tough, but cool stuff","If you like solving problems and want to just become a better thinker, this is a great class.","The course is excellently taught and it is very engaging. Those who don't think they are adept at physics and listen to us discussing the material are quite jealous of not being able to fully engage in it. It is very interesting and an insight into special relativity which is a major part of this course is definitely worth having.","Physics 15a is a great class for brushing up on and reinforcing concepts you learned in high school, as well as adding some more sophistication to the mechanics you already know. The course isn't terribly difficult, but Morin's excellent textbook, which includes the elementary and the more advanced, includes some insightful and challenging problems for those who want more. Morin is a great instructor who cares deeply and is a great person to talk to. The lab component of the course (PSI) is by far the best lab I have ever taken for a class. In all, an excellent class that you won't want to miss if you at least took some physics in high school.","Great class. It is difficult, but much better taught than physics 16 or 11. If you want to take physics, take 15."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["You might not like it, but if you enjoy physics this is probably better than 11a.","This psets for this course are shorter and easier than those for 11a.

For example near the end of the year, he decided not to teach us in depth about oscillation saying \"this is not a rigorous treatment of oscillations but that's ok\" before ending the lecture.  A lot of time in class is also wasted on demos.  Would still recommend this course of 11a.","Make sure you have a strong background in physics before taking this course.","Difficult, particularly if you haven't taken AP Physics in high school.","A good course for those who want to take a physics class but don't want to commit to Physics 16. Familiarity with physics and calculus is definitely recommended. Professor Samuel is a decent lecturer, but tends to mumble a bit. If you get Yang-Ting as your section leader, rejoice, since from my experience with him he was extremely helpful and clear.","You won't learn that much from lectures.  Get in a good section. If you don't like your TF, ask around and see which TFs are good, then ask them if you can join their section. A good TF will go over challenging and relevant problems that make you apply the concepts from class and improve your problem solving abilities. They will also ask for your help to solve the problems, instead of just telling you how to solve it. Go through the problems in the text book, and to study for exams redo homework problems and section problems. It is likely that you will see questions on your exams that have appeared before.","You learn a lot, but not necessarily in the most fun way. The class culture isn't very good: a large portion of the students are only taking the course because of an engineering or pre-med requirement, and don't really want to be there. Those interested in the material are often soft-spoken and don't exude passion for solving problems, and the really smart kids don't come to lecture and do the P-sets on their own the night before it's due. So the homework can be quite a chore, especially if you're struggling with the material in the first place. Also, the lab session lies somewhere between tedious and miserable. By the end though, you will have learned a lot, and should be proud to have gotten through a pretty tough course.","This class was not an easy intro class. The lectures are mediocre, but fine for learning the material. A lot of cool demonstrations help to make the lectures more engaging. The problem sets are time consuming but fair. The exams are very difficult and often repeat problems from past midterms. The Lab section is incredibly tedious if you've done research before or taken other lab courses before. You will learn a lot but probably be frustrated with at least the lab section of the course.","Many people are going to write here that it is hard.  Not everyone thinks so.  You CAN survive without going to Physics night, provided that you start your work early.\r\n\r\nAlso, beware of PSI.  It's slow, bearable torture that doesn't count as separate credit.","If you can, wait until Morin teaches this course again.  I feel that I did not get as much out of this course because he did not teach it this semester, but we did have access to Morin's lecture notes (which were extremely helpful). In any case, if you're still deciding between 15a and 11a, take 15a.  Special relativity is so cool.  This course is still worthwhile even if Morin is not teaching it.  (Although, I will warn you that the PSI labs for this course are painful.)","PSI is a waste of time.","Do lots of practice problems!","Not a lot of work each week, but exams and problem sets are very difficult.","If you take an interest in physics and work hard, then the course isn't so bad. But if either one of those are missing, then the course will be very difficult.","It's a lot of work with problem sets and PSI and lectures. If you don't have a good grasp of physics, it will be really difficult. I took AP Physics B and C, and I was scoring just at the average. The lectures don't really teach you anything, but section definitely does. Don't take it if you have no prior physics knowledge.","This course is no walk in the park if you did not have a relatively high-level physics course in high school.  If you don't like collaborating, I would also not recommend this class.  In addition, if you are an engineering student, you may be better off taking 11a because it covers more topics.  Relativity is interesting and all, but not very practical. Trains don't go that fast.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, this course does make you think flexibly and learn how to apply concepts to new and unexpected problems.  Very good training for thinking outside of the box if you are up for the challenge.  Go seek help when in doubt.  I didn't do that and it was a big mistake on my part.","The class might seem very daunting at first, but if you stick with it and work hard, you would be very glad at the end to have taken it. This course challenged me in a way that helped me think conceptually and analytically. I loved the introduction to special relativity","Lectures aren't the strongest, but the material is very interesting and you cover mechanics in a depth you should cover at some point in your life. Really emphasizes physical intuition over sheer mathematics, and I really enjoyed that aspect and learned a lot from it. Special relativity is fascinating; make sure you have a great TF that can discuss these concepts with you as well as help you with problem sets. As a side note, Zhao is a boss.","This is a great course to take if you want to learn concepts in physics without bothering to deal with all of the ugly math in physics 16. Though the midterms are pretty memorization heavy, the final does a really good job of testing your true understanding of the course. Overall a good class to take regardless of your future concentration.","This is a class for people who really like problem solving. If you want to spend hours solving really difficult problems, then take this class. Don't count on teachers to help, though!","It's a fun class. Sometimes I looked forward to doing psets. (Whoa.)","Great class. It's definitely not \"plug-and-chug\" physics.","While the material is extremely interesting, the class itself is often disjointed or disorganized -- take it only if your interest in physics is concrete enough to accomodate learning large sections of the class out of the textbook\/lecture notes and dealing with a huge weekly time investment in a lab component that doesn't relate to the class proper.","Make sure you consider who is teaching the class (Morin vs. Samuel) as I think this makes a huge difference in the experience people have had with the class. Also, definitely go to physics night in Lev","I am writing to people who are considering 15 vs. 16. I started out in physics 16 and then dropped down to 15a. It was possibly the best decision I have made this semester. I took both AP Physics B and C in high school and AP Calc BC, but physics 16 was sort of over my head. It was manageable, but I was spending about 15 hours each week just trying to scrape by. 15 is much more reasonable and allows you to enjoy your first semester beyond physics. The lectures are more straightforward, and you will be challenged but not lost in this class. I was afraid 15 might be too easy, but I think it is just about right after a strong AP background in high school. If you have taken college courses, higher level math, or studied on your own you might want 16, but I think 15 is the right course for the rest of us.","Though the material is difficult, going to the TFs OHs, particularly Matt's, will get you through the psets, and Zhao and Matt's sections are the better ones, though Yang Ting provides great one-on-one help. Try to avoid physics nights because they get very long (longer than you anticipate), and very hot. In addition, the midterms and final are pretty difficult, but doing the homework and practice before should get you at least above average, which is all you need to do pretty well in the class.","This class is very manageable and very well taught. The assignments are reasonable and the midterms are very manageable if you put the effort in. Professor Samuel is awesome, and so friendly so if he's teaching, definitely go to his office hours. Beware PSI.","It is a fun class to push yourself in if you have a passion for physics.","Tough, but definitely do-able and rewarding. Learn from the problems. Do tons.","The midterms can still kill you even if you know the material. Don't fret about it.","If possible, find out when Morin is teaching this class again and take it then. Samuel essentially uses all of Morin's materials but only explains it half as well.","This course is difficult; do not let the fact that it is not Physics 16 fool you. However, if you have a decent grasp of the physics it examines already, then there should be no problem.","The class itself is very easy if you have a basic intuition for mechanics. If you took AP Physics C, you won't learn anything new except for special relativity, and if you have any trouble with that, your section should be able to make things clear. If you want to take this course for a way to make your overall schedule easier, it's perfect.  However, if they continue to run PSI (basically lab) the same way that they did this year, you should not take this course unless you love sitting in a computer lab running statistical analysis for 3 hours straight each week. If they get rid of PSI, though, definitely take it.","This course is not easy even for those with strong backgrounds in physics. Don't expect an easy course even though there is no \"new\" material if you've taken AP physics.","Only take this course if you really want to do physics and even then if you don't like it by the add\/drop deadline, DROP","Make sure you understand the problem sets thoroughly.","This IS David Morin's class and when taught by a different instructor inevitably becomes disorganized. Was disappointed that the iSite was not kept up-to-date. For example, no practice final exams were ever posted and we had to go find the iSite for a previous offering of the course. When Morin taught it last semester, all old exams and solutions since 2002 were posted so we could practice for the exams. This semester: essentially none. Lectures were not very helpful for understanding the topics deeply enough to complete the problem sets. You could probably be successful in the class without going to lecture and only reading through Morin's lecture notes. Definitely try to teach this class when Morin teaches is, because it is HIS class. No offense to Samuel, but it's just not HIS course. But then... there's PSI. PSI (the lab component of the course) is by far the worst thing that has happened to me at Harvard so far. It was a COMPLETE waste of my time, 3 hours every week, the 3 most BORING hours of my life every week. I learned absolutely nothing in PSI, and it should be immediately removed from the course. It felt like a timid and horribly organized attempt to mash a really dumbed-down version of Stat 111 into physics.","IF YOU LIKE PHYSICS TAKE 16. OR TRY TO. This class has really pushed down my interest in physics, which was pretty great before the year. Maybe that was by unconscious design, since I chose 55 over 16, but this class was not challenging or thought-provoking and from what my friends said  16 was for the most part. So take 16.","It is sometimes hard to grasp the subjects, but it is definitely a class with a lot of potential to learn. Very interesting and worth taking.","do a lot of problem sets","Tough, but (somewhat) doable, (and not as fun as CS50). This class is super tough, but it helped me learn how to work hard. Unless you're a physics genius, psets are impossible to do alone. Find a group, go to office hours. If choosing between 11a and 15a - it's a tough choice. There were many times where I contemplated dropping down, and once the point of no return was passed, I sometimes regretted not dropping. But then I started understanding stuff and getting stuff right on the first try with little to minimal help. I worked super hard - sought out the best TF and went to his section, went to the office hours. I also would have liked this course more without PSI. Ultimately, I would actually recommend 15a, though, because you'll feel much more accomplished and it's worth it! Even though this will definitely be my worst grade so far :(","Try to take it when Morin teaches it.","The course has an amazing foundation that the previous Prof. Morin set up.  If Prof. Samuel is teaching it again, he will likely not add anything of his own.  He is also slow to post solutions and other lecture materials to the course website.\r\n\r\nHowever, the work Morin has done with putting together this course is great!  I would highly advise you all to visit the past course websites to just find more problems with which to practice.  I felt pretty competent with AP Physics C in high school and this course offered problems which were still extremely difficult, but extremely rewarding to solve.  \r\n\r\nThe only way you will do well in this course is if you practice problems--so don't slack off all semester and expect to learn all the elegant tricks in a few days!\r\n\r\nIf you can plan for it, try to take this course with Morin!  I just think he would be much more enthusiastic with the material and more engaging as a professor.  Prof. Samuel is not as dynamic a lecturer.","This course is very difficult.","Don't take this class if it's just gonna be another p-set class you're taking, because then it'll be a pain. We did some really neat problems on out p-sets that are definitely pretty cool. But generally the class could get extremely tedious and the midterms could be pretty hard for everyone. I found the lectures and lecturer quite boring and uninspiring. But just remember the main strength of this class is the cool (and yes, quite difficult at times) problems on p-sets, etc.","This course was pretty poorly taught and it was a constant struggle. Unless it is taught in a different way, then I would not recommend taking this class unless you absolutely need to!","To get the most out of this class, read Morin's book.  It does a really great job of explaining everything covered in lecture, which you might not have understood the first time through.  Overall a good class; problem sets are doable and not too difficult, and sections are quite good.  PSI (lab) is still a work in progress, though very interesting at times.","Don't take this class.","This class is awesome!!! It's not TOO too hard, if you pay attention in lecture and go to section - you'll end up completing most of the problem set during section, so they're really not too bad. Honestly, the only reservation I would have in recommending this class is that 3 hours a week is RIDICULOUS for lab. PSI is a really big time commitment. But other than that, a fun\/useful class!","This class is easier than previous years, and is not as hard as you think. As long as you have a strong foundation in physics, you will be able to handle this class without much difficulty. The textbook is extremely useful - you will love it if you are a true physics fan.","Depending on your high school background, you may find this class quite difficult, but the workload is manageable. Make sure to understand the problem sets thoroughly, and doing more practice problems is the only way to study for midterms!","While not the most engaging course, I would recommend it over other physics tracks due to the feeling of mastery that come with being able to solve challenging problems. That being said, PSI can be a struggle to get through and also represents a significant investment of time for not as significan results.","I'd recommend this course to any student interested in physics, but not when prof. Samuel is teaching!","Great class, tough work and problems for homework and exams, but doable. Way more interesting than high school physics (and I thought high school physics was awesome)","If you have not taken AP physics, then THINK TWICE about taking this class. I only took honors in high school, and I felt very lost for most of the semester. If you do decide to take this class (though you should probably take 11), then take the time to make sure you understand all of the concepts. On another note, PSI, the lab for this course, is completely unrelated to the class itself. Also, the lectures are very unorganized and not well put together.","The lecture, section, and lab components are COMPLETELY unrelated. If you have a good section you will do fine and learn physics, but if not you might be very frustrated.","Lectures, on the whole, are accessible to all levels of prior knowledge - though it would be very helpful to have some basic background of physics and\/or one-variable calculus. Demos are always entertaining (and educational, of course). Beware of problem sets, though - they go beyond the sophistication of the lectures, and they usually eat up your Wednesday nights (and very early Thursday mornings, depending on your level of procrastination). Make sure to start problem sets early and stay on top of the material, and you'll be fine.","Professor Samuel did a really great job, so if you're taking it while he's teaching, that's a plus (though maybe the others are great, too - I wouldn't know). Having shopped 16, this one's definitely a compromise between survival - which would've been hard in 16 - and learning a lot - which you still do here.","Be prepared to work, and figure stuff out on your own!","This course is fast and furious. Do not be fooled by the word \"introductory\" in the title of the course--if you are not familiar with the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics (and even then) you may fall behind.","This is not a class that you should take unless you need it for a concentration.","The more preparation, the better.","Very difficult, professor samuel isn't necessarily the best at explaining problems in lecture.","Take the course with an understanding that the lectures don't always prepare you for the problem sets; be sure to study in groups.","The class has interesting problems that make it a more enjoyable choice than some of the other lower level physics classes.","Be prepared for a class that is definitely much more difficult than AP Physics C: Mechanics.","If you're thinking about choosing this class based on its reputation as \"better taught\" or \"more fulfilling\" than 11a, don't. If you're genuinely interested in physics and don't mind a lot of self-teaching, go for it. Also, definitely attend the physics nights where everyone does their psets together, because a)its the only way to pass, and b)you make a ton of friends along the way.","Difficult and not that well taught."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class covers material that you have most likely already seen if you took high school physics, but the problems are harder.","Somewhat like high school physics. Overall, not bad, but not super exciting either. The problem sets were not that difficult. The midterms were more challenging though. PSI was not really all that useful.","It was much easier this semester, but I think Morin is coming back soon, so it might get harder later, no idea.\r\nIf you've taken AP Physics, it will be a cakewalk. Try Physics 16 for the challenge if this remains as easy, and if you have the required math backround.","Excellent course if you are good at and enjoy physics.","DO NOT take this course with Vafa. Vafa is really detached and doesn't care about anything much. The TFs are all extremely disorganized and irresponsible - which you might expect, since they're all undergrads. The course mechanics are all over the place. And you'll learn a lot less than you did with Vafa. If you're like me and wanting to take this course to actually learn physics, unlike options like 11a\/the PS sequence, wait until someone else is teaching it. Wait for Morin to come back, if possible.","Be prepared for a difficult course","This year it was taught by Vafa, who apparently has not taught it in 10 years. Keep that in mind when reading the comments, as it may be taught differently next time.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this was a hard class, and most of what I got out of it was from the problem sets, section and reading the book. The lectures were very proof-oriented and little time was spent explaining things conceptually. A strong background in math is helpful, because that's pretty much all you see in lecture. You will use the dot\/cross product, so take Math 21a concurrently at least! There were some cool demos though (a demo every lecture, I believe!) which were useful. I DID, however, have a few revelations during the class where I finally understood how to do certain types of problems. I also got a good sense for how calculus plays into physics. In my opinion, to get the most out of this class, check (or work through hard parts of) problem sets with your peers and get to know your section leader. Perhaps the lectures will change in the future but this year I only found them marginally helpful (some people I know stopped attending them).\r\n\r\nOh, I almost forgot, PSI. This is the lab component of the course, and it was sometimes pretty dull (we spent weeks trying to model a pendulum). You do learn useful skills (chi squared analysis, the importance of error, etc.), but looking at the same system for weeks can get bland. The final project where we get to do our own experiment was interesting though, and I have a feeling they might make a few changes to PSI next time.","From what I have heard, take the class taught from Professor Vafa. His lectures can actually be entertaining at times.","This class will give you a solid understanding of basic mechanics.  In general, the problem sets aren't too awful, the exams are hard, and PSI is unnecessarily tedious and boring.","AP Physics will definitely make this class easy for you","This class is extremely difficult. If you have to take it as a concentration requirement be ready to put in the hours. I would not recommend this class if you do not have to take it. I thought I wanted to concentrate in engineering until I took this class.","This class is necessary for a lot of concentrations and the pre med requirements, so if you have to take it you have to take it. Grin and bear it and start the psets early. If you put enough effort in, you'll be okay.","It's not a great class, but that's mainly because it's frankly a basic physics class. It's hard to make introductory mechanics interesting, but the lecture component needs work, and the lab tried really hard but needs work still.","THIS IS NOT AN INTRO COURSE. This course assumes prior knowledge of calc-based physics. If you took AP physics B in high school like me, you will have to work very hard to catch up to those that took physics C. It's definitely doable, but unless you need it for your concentration, if you didn't take physics C in high school, I'd recommend taking physics 11a here.","Its not the class- its the subject.  There's just really nothing to recommend kinematics, which means that this class is both hard and boring.  But Vafa is a fairly entertaining lecturer (although he just does derivations).  It is a good intro to physics, with a little calc and stuff thrown in.","It's a hard course. Don't take it as a fifth class and only take it as a fourth class if you are confident in your physics abilities.","This is a very good physics class. For me it was difficult enough to be rewarding but not to difficult to be impossible.","If you're not too intense of a physics person, definitely take 15a in the spring and b in the fall","It's mechanics. You should sort of know what to expect. Special relativity was great.","If you are interested in physics, definitely take the class. If not, I would still recommend it.","PSI was useless and a waste of time, but the lectures were interesting and Vafa is funny sometimes. The lectures don't teach you the material they ask about on the psets though...","Very interesting course (with focus on mechanics)","The course pushes you to new and wonderful limits; it's a great way to get started on physics at Harvard.","It is a very educational course however, it is a lot of work.  If you are not a physics concentrator or mechanical engineer you are better off taking an easier version.","It's challenging but you learn a lot","This course was extremely challenging for me, and I had always excelled in physics prior to this class.  I did not really enjoy the class and it made me reconsider what fields I want to go into.  I felt that the first midterm was unfair, and that if I had studied for many more hours, I still would not have been able to get a decent grade.  The lectures were not helpful to me, as the professor simply derived most of the equations that were in the textbook, while doing a few demonstrations here and there.  I would not recommend this class to those who are not interested in physics nor need it as a requirement (like I did).","it's an amazing course! if you're willing to put in the work you will learn so much! and if you have a chance to take it with professor Vafa- do it! he is amazing! and his teaching is very clear and organized. he also explains all the theorems very well.","Don't be fooled by the psets. The exams are much harder."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Take it only if you need to and there is a different professor.","The lectures may seem intimidating at first, but know that you don't have to understand every step in the proofs and instead focus on understanding the concepts.","Only take this class if Morin is teaching it. Gabrielse is nice, if a bit condescending, but cannot teach a course at this level. He is very obviously a brilliant man and I suppose basic mechanics is just so second nature to him that he cannot explain it to someone who doesn't already understand? If you are taking this class to \"challenge yourself\" and because you don't want to cop out and take the easier 11a (or PS options, if you're premed), definitely reconsider. This class was hell. The resources are distinctly NOT available to you, only one or two TFs are worth anything at all. Meeting with Jerry (Gabrielse,the professor) won't help--he essentially told me that \"some people just don't get physics\" when I approached him with concerns about the midterm\/overall understanding of the material. \r\nThat being said, if Jerry is teaching the class, memorize every example and every problem set problem. Don't redo them, just honestly memorize the solutions. He takes his exam questions from his posted notes and from the psets--do not let this fool you, however. The exams are not easy. The spread is always huge: a big chunk of the class does well, some people do okay, some poorly, some abysmally. Meeting with other students in the class, we decided the best way to study for the midterms is to honest-to-god memorize as many solutions as possible.\r\nApart from class, PSI is a different story. The matlab really sucks, but is a generally useful tool. The sections are frustrating and challenging but rewarding and Amir Yacoby, Joon Pahk and Carrie are AWESOME. I personally think PSI should be a class of it's own, required for science concentrators. \r\nAlso the TFing was SO sloppy. I heard of and experienced EXAMS where the point value was up to 25 points less than the grade was actually supposed to be due to lazy adding of points while grading. Also, I had my psets lost or parts of them lost a couple times. It was a nightmare dealing with the logistics of this class.\r\nIf you end up taking this, good luck. You'll need it.","Gerry's lectures were funny and interesting, I really enjoyed them which was surprising to me. The lab portion of the course is not very helpful and they did not teach Matlab very well at all.","I would only recommend taking this course if you are doing so to fulfill a requirement or reach higher level physics. It is by no means a terrible experience, but it is certainly not an inspiring one.","I took a lot of physics in highschool, and despite the number of times the instructor told us about how this was more in depth than highschool physics, I found it to be the exact same material. That doesn't mean it will be easy though, as many of the assignments are vague and complicated to the point of not making sense.","Painful","You will do fine in this course if you have taken an AP physics course in high school, and you will probably still be able to manage just fine if you have at least seen physics before. The work is reasonable and the tests are not that difficult. The only thing I would recommend before taking this course is to first take a look at Applied Physics 50. There are no labs or in class tests from what I have heard from my friends taking the course. I am considering AP50b next semester instead of Physics 15b. Only thing is that the lectures for AP50 are three hours long.","Professor Gabrielse is really nice but his lectures are unbearably boring. He goes through many derivations which are just unnecessary and never come up on the exams. The psets are fun to do if you can deal with the boring lectures. He does care about the students though, and he is not an unfair teacher.","This class all depends on who's teaching it. Gabrielse was a bit of a disaster. I've heard Morin is better. Do your research before deciding what semester to take it!","Physics 15a is one of those foundational courses one has to take. It's not particularly interesting and can be pretty frustrating at times. Gabrielse course is nice in that he focuses on concepts rather than ridiculously difficult mechanic problems.","If it's Gabrielse teaching it, it's a lot easier than Morin's 15a. It's still a cool class and I recommend it, because learning special relativity is pretty cool. Even as a pre-med who really doesn't need this in depth of a physics course, I really thought it was interesting.","AP Physics C won't be enough to get you through this class so don't expect to be able to cruise just because you get a 5 on the AP test, even though it will help.  Very conceptual course, not just plugging numbers into formulas.","If you've already taken the AP Physics C, this class is pretty useless.","This is one of the best intro physics classes you can take here. If you are a pre-med looking for a real physics education, take this class.","With this professor and teaching staff, the class was like a repetition of AP Physics C, with some special relativity.","I took Physics 15a, because I had an amazing high school teacher and thought I really liked physics. Of course, I did learn a lot of physics in this class! Especially because 15a is very different from an AP Physics class. However, I felt that most people were taking it as part of their concentration. The professor's attitude about the class also shows that Physics 15a is definitely a preparation for later on. That said, if you are not sure WHY you are taking physics, don't take this class too early (like freshman fall). Physics 15a is a LOT of hours, with class (3 hours), section (1.5 hours), lab (3 hours), problem sets (a couple of hours), AND MatLab (lab) homework (about an hour, or two). This is A LOT of time to spend of physics ...","Only take this class if you're a physics concentrator and you don't have enough background or time to take Physics 16.","This course is much much much better taught than physics 16, as it promotes a deeper understanding rather than trying to drown you with math and confusing the overall picture of the physics.","READ THE TEXTBOOK first when you need help, and use the office hours, they're great.","The professor changes from year to year and thus the class will change from year to year. I had Professor Gabrielse and his style of teaching is mostly proofs in class but as the semester went on, he did try to add in a lot more problems.","I wouldn't recommend this class to a student unless they have a solid background in physics and calculus.","If you like physics, this class is a good opportunity to learn how all the equations you memorized in high school physics are really just extensions of Newton's 2nd law.  If you've taken AP Physics, you will probably already know how to work some of the problems you will see in this course.  Nevertheless, lecture + section + PSI Lab + matlab assignments + problem sets yields a pretty considerable time commitment for this class, even if you grasp the content pretty easily.","Great introduction to Mechanics and Relativity. Just make sure you know your math well enough to follow along in lectures. If one focuses on concepts over problems, the problem sets become easier.","This class can definitely be taken with not much background in high school physics - don't let that scare you away from taking it. It's a fair amount of time with the PSI component, but it's not all that bad. The research part near the end of the semester was interesting.","Read the lecture notes and understand the broad concepts which tend to show up on the exam more than very detailed, complex systems.","You must have the skills to self-study in order to succeed in this course. Lectures cover derivation of basic equations, and sections cover a few sample problems, but in order to gain a thorough understanding, you should really read the textbook and do more problems from the textbook. In addition, never fall behind. It's very hard to catch up once you do so.","If you are interested in physics, I would recommend trying Physics 16 first, and dropping down to 15a only if you feel you need to.","The course material is pretty good, and relativity especially is very interesting. It expects a solid high school background- at the AP Physics C level, or AP Physics B with a pretty solid Calculus background. While I really liked the material, I didn't like the lecture style for this year, so keep in mind which professor is teaching it when you plan when to take it (this course is usually offered in the fall and spring.)","Take this course if you are comfortable with all the concepts of AP Physics C: Mechanic. If you are contemplating between physics 15a and 16, I would recommend you shop both. For me, problem sets were not the problem, the exams were. I think I might have been better off in 16 because there is no exam in that class, just problem sets, which I am much better at doing than timed exams.","I love physics but this course was not fun. The lectures have nothing to do with the midterms or psets; the only reason to attend them is the occasional mini-quiz. The psets are very easy conceptually but sometimes the problems will lead you to ridiculous sets of equations that you need mathematica to solve (which isn't covered in class). The textbook doesn't help with anything. The exams are so random and sometimes have nothing to do with class. Also, they have like 2 questions so make sure you don't mess up on one. PSI is grueling; of the 3 hours at least 90 minutes will be awkward silences and the most exciting thing you do is measure distances. The course is really easy, though, and curved. Consider physics 16 if you want a more interesting course.","A good extension of high school mechanics. Not explicit enough about what kind of material the exams would cover. Professor Gabrielse's lectures are fun!","Taking this class this semester was honestly one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had, simply because the course material isn't even that hard but the sheer apathy and ineffectiveness of so much of the teaching staff makes it so much more difficult to have a constructive learning environment. I GUARANTEE that PSI will be the dullest three hours of your semester, unless it undergoes a thorough transformation. Jerry is good guy, but he was very disorganized in teaching this course and I would strongly advise against taking this course until David Morin teaches it again. He also made it rather difficult to reach out for him for help by not having set office hours. He's also very good at making students feel behind by asking questions like \"Who's never seen a partial derivative?\" and less than 10% of the class would have the bravery to raise their hands. Most of the teaching fellows have an air of either apathy, haughtiness, or both. Only Patrick and Jim seem to really want you to do well.\r\n\r\nI loved physics all through high school and I wanted to be a physicist in the future. I still like the subject, but I'm finding it difficult to bring myself to take another physics course at Harvard if the other classes are taught even remotely close to the way this one was taught because at this rate, my love for physics will be butchered.","David Morin and Gerald Gabrielse have very different teaching styles.  David Morin's 15a course is much harder","The professor is what makes the course and this year the professor made it a good experience.  The knowledge is necessary for continuing on in the sciences and this course gives a good preparation for future physics and science classes.","Great, manageable course to learn classical mechanics and physics.","I had a terrible experience in this course. First, it took way too much time. 7.5 hours of class time per week between lab, lecture, and section is way too much. Add 1.5 hours of Matlab and 6-7 hours of homework, and you're spending a full day on this per week literally. When I struggled, the TFs and professor were not especially helpful. If you aren't VERY invested in physics, please reconsider.","It's not an easy class, and you have to put work into it if you want an A. It is well taught though, and the teaching staff all cares. I hate physics so I didn't like the class, but if you like physics I think it's a good class.","It is quite difficult but you walk away with a deeper and more fluid understanding of physics than you ever would in high school, and many of the holes that high school physics left in your mind, this class fills.","This is an awesome course! Don't let the apparent difficulty fool you- it's very approachable, and this is coming from a not-so-good-at-math pre-med. Everyone in this class is here to learn some physics and the atmosphere is much more relaxed than that of the uber-competitive PS2. In fact, it's probably easier to get a better grade in this class.","Good class. Prof Gabrielse genuinely cares about making sure you understand the material. The TFs are also really helpful with completing psets. The midterms\/tests are very reasonable and are not written to try to trick you.","Your experience in this class is really up to which professor's teaching it, how much time you invest outside of class, and how good your section TF is.","This was a better alternative to Physics 16, although I think that the exams turned out way more conceptual than those of previous years, so it took a little while to get used to.","It is a hard class, but if you have a strong high school physics background and are good at learning out of the book it is not too bad.","Not terribly difficult. Jerry Gabrielse is a great professor. 11a is poorly taught and not much easier.","This course offers a great introduction to mechanics and physics in general. Don't shortchange yourself by taking a \"easier course\" or a fake physics course, take this one instead. It will change the way that you view the world around you, and also make you a better problem solver in the process.","Gabrielse is a fantastic lecturer who is the kind, slightly absent-minded, funny professor you would want your science teacher to be. The material is also fascinating, and special relativity in particular redefines your understanding of space, time, and motion. I would definitely build a stomach for the obnoxious didactic methods of the TFs and PSI: scientists (particularly of the graduate variety) revel in pretending they don't know the answers to the questions they pose; and so much time is wasted hearing or venturing an answer that proves to miss the mark and then being shut down by these uncharismatic types.","Physics 15a is a course in flux, and it certainly shows. It doesn't have a foundational vibe, rather, it teaches you a very specific way of learning physics. The personal touch of the instructor this year was to teach you how to get INTO a problem, and the structure of the tests (and of the pset questions he wrote himself) reflected that value for depth rather than breadth (read: 15 subpoints per question).","Gabrielse is a great professor to take this course with.","I would only recommend this class with enthusiasm (which I did) because of Jerry. He was a phenomenal teacher who not only was able to teach (everyone who has had a bad teacher in the past knows what I mean by having a bad teacher and the difference that it can make in the class), and also because he did not make us get bogged down with math, instead he made sure that we all understood the main concepts and ideas of physics, and only then would he add the math.","Only take it if you have to as a course requirement.","The problem sets are really long, but they are worth it if you do them right and learn from the questions. Lecture was a waste of time, since no one ever knew what the professor was talking about. Section was a great place to learn and ask questions.","15a was an interesting course. Exams were only two questions long (even the final) with lots and lots of subparts making them not too difficult, but also easy to get things wrong.","This course is OK. It definitely manages to accomplish its goal in teaching Newtonian Mechanics and Special Relativity. The lectures are great and Professor Gabrielse is excellent. Unfortunately, the homework was not enjoyable and the sections were awful. Luckily exams weren't bad. This class makes several assumptions about background in physics and math that students come in with so I would only recommend this course for those who have already taken a physics course in high school and for those who are comfortable with mathematics.","The material is more difficult, but also more interesting than you will likely encounter in the lower physics courses. Special relativity was really interesting and in the end I'm glad I took the course for that reason. However, it was pretty badly organized, so it might not be worth that stress if you don't need it for a requirement, unless of course they improve it.","It's different but nonetheless effective at teaching you the basic concepts of mechanics.","The course is not as challenging as many may suppose, especially if you have some physics background.","15a is your traditional newtonian mechanics course with calculus.  Take it if you like a good, old fashioned lecture style and handritten problems (as opposed to a ton of matlab or something)","Do not take this class if Gabrielse is teaching it. Worst class I have taken in my entire life.","I think that this class is very well taught, however in order to be a good student you have to follow through on further discussion of concepts that you don't understand.","This course went very slowly, so you might want to take Physics 16 if you want a more rigorous physics education","This course is a necessity for future courses in the department, and although it is a hassle at times it is overall a great overview of mechanics and relativity to be used for future courses."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Depending on who's teaching physics 15a, the course may vary significantly. The course was interesting and fun, but the assignments were demanding and not always understandable. The quizzes got pretty difficult near the end, but the final project was fun.","This class was the most difficult class I ever took, but it was also the most lenient with the grades and the most concerned with personal growth instead of competitiveness.  And that is really how it should be.","Wait for another professor. The lack of midterms was nice, but ultimately didn't help me understand the material.","Really difficult for a person who decided to take this for gen-ed credit. I'm a math person and I really didn't enjoy the difficulty of the psets.","The course was consistently difficult but very rewarding.","Be aware that if Prof. Georgi is teaching 15a, you will essentially be taking Physics 16. You will be up until at least 12-1am every Wednesday night (frequently much later) working on the psets, which are punishingly difficult--this isn't because everyone leaves them to the last minute, it's because they're essentially impossible unless you're collaborating with a large group or doing them in office hours (which Professor Georgi, who is understandably busy, didn't have very often). The TFs are helpful--go to as many of their office hours as you can. Professor Georgi will occasionally talk down to you during office hours (given how easy and simple the material is, he has a tendency to get frustrated and a bit angry when people have trouble understanding it), but if you are willing to take a bit of punishment from him his office hours are helpful as well. If you can, take the class pass\/fail so you don't have to stress out about his impossible quizzes.","I highly recommend this course for those of you who are willing to put in a lot of work! If Georgi is teaching it, it will be much more like Physics 16 so be prepared for a much more difficult class than you may be expecting, but I also think it's much more rewarding in the end! If it is not Georgi teaching it, it will be easier but still a lot of work. Either way it's a good class but very challenging.","I hate writing this because I hate to be mean but if you want honesty then here goes.  I am sorry.  The class was painful.  I didn't learn a single thing from lecture and the problem sets destroyed me.  This class ended up ruining my entire spring semester.  Every morning I would wake up dreading this class.  A couple times, I had to take sleeping pills to try to get to sleep because this class was so strongly haunting my mind.  It didn't really damage me too much in my other ares of study but affected me so dramatically, that my social life was in shambles due to my utter inability to cope with this course.  I can literally look at my spring semester and attribute everything bad about it to this class.  It put so much strain on my relationships with my peers that some of those relationships straight up ended and others are damaged beyond repair.  If you are set on taking this class, please get in contact with the mental health resources Harvard has.  It would have helped me.  And again, I am sorry to have written this.","This class varies greatly depending on the teacher. Georgi has his strengths, but he is also disorganized at times and hard to follow. That said, you will not regret taking it if he is teaching. Look carefully at the professor who is teaching the course the semester you want to take it, and let that guide you more than what the class is about.","If you are really into physics, fine, take it. If you don't have a good experience in physics (I took AP Physics B, but the teacher was not very good and the class was not the best) DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Although it says intro (it really shouldn't say intro...), this is not an introductory class. If you are looking for a physics class that is one level up from AP Physics or if you're looking for a class reintroduces concepts in AP Physics because you might have not had the best experience in high school, look toward another class.","Under Georgi's leadership, this class is difficult but amazing.  Learned so much and worked so hard, and built real friendships in this class.  I got pushed further into physics than I thought I would.  Had I taken this course earlier in my academic career, I think I might have been a physics concentrator.  Grading is somewhat arbitrary which can be frustrating at times, but if you work extremely hard and give it your all you can get through it!","Physics 15a is a course that really gets into Newtonian Mechanics and relativity at a level beyond AP Physics C, but taught by Professor Georgi, it is not for students who a) have little interest in physics and b) do not feel that they are strong in physics. Physics Night on Wednesdays is one of the most stressful nights of the week, and no one can complete the problem sets alone - it is necessary to work together to figure them out. I would recommend this class only to students who have already a solid foundation in Newtonian Mechanics and who are willing to put in a lot of work to complete the homework. That said, I have heard that the class is much easier taught by a different professor, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into!","Be prepared to work.","It really depends on who's teaching this class. This year, because Prof. Georgi was teaching, the class became harder than usual and sometimes really confusing. Other years, the course has been easier partly because of the instructor. Make sure you shop it before taking and see if you like the teaching style and if you can meet the professor's expectations. If you get Prof. Georgi, be prepared to work really hard, be challenged (and be wading in tons of ugly equations), and be confused. The course is definitely doable but you're probably going to need 7-10 hours a week. It's hard, but I did learn some interesting physics and problem solving in the end.","Do not underestimate this course coming in. College level physics is quite a jump up from high school so the first couple weeks can seem overwhelming. That being said, if you stick with it and put in the work and get help from the TFs, you will learn a lot and develop a great foundation of mechanics that will prepare you well for future physics classes.","Hard but cool material and definitely a good experience; Georgi is awesome.","Make sure the course structure is conducive to learning for you no matter what background you have in physics. It's important that you get the most out of the course, especially when the material gets harder.","Difficult, but a great experience. If I had to go back, I would definitely take it again.","15a with Georgi is, from what I can tell, significantly more difficult than with the normal professors.  But I have learned a lot.  Class time unfortunately ends up virtually useless as his lecture style is a bit convoluted, but Morin is a wonderful textbook and the problem set problems are great.  You will make a lot of friends at physics night! :)  And of course there is the necessary evil that is PSI.","I learned a lot during the class and physics night \/ lab offer a lot of opportunities to meet classmates. Definitely try to go to early office hours if you can.","I liked physics in high school so I decided to take this course. It was much more difficult and more advanced than anything we learned in high school and required a lot of knowledge and familiarity of calculus. If math is not your strength, it can be a struggle. A good amount of students, including myself, were not able to do the problem sets alone or without the guidance of a TF during multiple office hours throughout the week. It is a very interesting course, but can be almost too advanced to the point where it feels like you're not getting much out of it.","First, it is worth noting that physics 15A is taught very differently in the fall as it is in the spring, as the professors are different. The following applies to the spring class, which I took. I must say, while there were many parts of this class that I liked (ex. the topics covered, the interesting and engaging questions on the problem sets), I came out a little frustrated with it overall. My main issue with it was the lack of clarity in the lectures. I felt as though the ideas were presented in a disjunct manner without regard to broader physical context, or a sense of why this topic is worth studying. This was especially true of the math. The mathematical concepts in this class were presented sometimes out of the blue, but almost always with little derivation, or explanation regarding why the concepts work to explain the physical world. I found this annoying because we give so much trust to the math, but why should we trust it if we don't know why it actually works? I think that the lectures, on one hand, needs to be a little more rigorous mathematically (of course this isn't a math class, but mathematical rigor will make us more comfortable understanding why the math works). On the other hand, I think that the math could be presented more in tandem with a physical picture of what's going on. Otherwise, I thought this class gave me solid practice solving a wide range of physical problems, which is definitely good.","This class assumes a STRONG background in physics. This should  NOT be the first physics class a student has ever taken! Also strong background in math is necessary. It is a challenging course but also quite rewarding.","This class was pretty tough and confusing at times.","It's very challenging, but rewarding. The concepts can be hard to grasp, but this class is structured in a way that really maximizes your learning - my favorite parts were always Physics Night on Wednesday night with everyone else struggling through the problem set. It's very possible to get a good grade in this class if you put in the effort. You will learn a lot.","If Professor Georgi is teaching, I advise that you do not take this class. As fun as he often is, he provides very little help in terms of the actual physics.","Georgi is a very frustrating person to deal with in general. You will spend a ton of time just trying to figure out what he wants you to do on the psets. There is no clarity. It will be necessary to go to physics night or some other office hours for every pset. This is because they are hard (this doesn't bother me so much), but also because all the information you need to solve the problems is almost never all there. You need to squeeze it out of the TFs. Thats not doing physics that's just probing TFs for info that should be given. Lastly, Georgi is a very condescending personality that I personally didn't like to deal with at all.","See who is teaching the course before enrolling","Professor Georgi is a great physics professor, and really cares about you as a student. He makes a real effort to get to know you and help you understand the material. This class is a lot of work but you will learn so much and have a great professor!","It starts off a little slowly, but definitely picks up after a while","This class is much harder than what you will expect. Only take this class if you are prepared to put in many hours outside of class to work on psets and figure out the physics. Almost every lecture was spent thinking \"what in the world is going on here\", and only after several hours in office hours, section, and working in groups outside of class were we able to figure things out.","Georgi is a great guy, but beware that the course will be very hard. Often his lectures didn't seem to make any sense. He can be somewhat condescending when you ask him questions at office hours. I always felt that I didn't have enough information to complete the problem sets until Physics night, and would often struggle and have no clue what was going on. Everyone bombed Georgi's weekly quizzes, so don't worry if you struggle at them. I was unprepared for the difficulty of the class. Form a study group and start the psets early so you don't cram them during physics nights.","Assignments are mentally exhausting.","P-sets are difficult, but aren't graded hard.  It's also a good thing this class didn't have midterms or a final.","Definitely take this class if you're a physics major, but for premeds with a weaker math background this class may not be for you. At least this semester, the problem sets were very computational and required lots of use of Mathematica and intuitive factoring\/algebraic skills.","Taking 15a with Georgi is a little like taking \"16 lite.\" This class was probably harder and more mathematically intensive than other versions of the course in the post-Morin era. Georgi puts lots of work into the class and Morin's textbook is extremely helpful. The weekly quizzes could be tricky, but having quizzes and a project are worth it because there are no exams. The time commitment isn't unreasonable, but make sure you leave Wednesday nights open for physics night. Even as someone only taking this as an elective\/gen ed, I can recommend this course over the other first semester physics courses offered here as long as you have the math background.","This is a class unlike others.  It's very collaborative--if you're not getting things on the first try, it's ok--most likely no one else is either, and you're encouraged to discuss the topics and work on the problems with everyone else.  Georgi is a great guy, but sometimes his teaching is a little confusing.  Use all the resources available to you--go to office hours, physics nights etc to make sure you really understand the topics because a large portion of your grade is your explanations that prove your grasp of the material.\r\nAnd read the definition of a coherence check thoroughly in the beginning.","By far the most difficult introductory physics course in the nation, which in some sense is rewarding, but unless you are willing to struggle with the material and actually be interested enough to spend a significant portion of your week on psets, I would steer clear. Also, check your physics background. I got a 5 on AP Physics B and was not really prepared for the material.","Be ready to be challenged with Georgi (I'm not sure of other instructors), but be ready to like it more the harder you try.","Professor Georgi may be a good teacher for physics 16, but he makes 15a a lot harder than I was expecting it to be, given the \"introduction\" label. Not a course for people with little background in physics.","Find good study partners! Cooperation is key.","Hard course but interesting.  Must be willing to put in the time if Georgi is teaching.  Often obscure and problem sets can be tricky.","Great course. Mostly because Georgi is a great teacher - he selected problems for the problem sets so so well. I felt like I learned a specific principle on almost every problem and it never felt like busywork and the solutions were sometimes really cool."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["If you need to take physics and are pretty good at it, then this is a good class to take! It can be challenging at times, but if you had strong physics in high school (especially AP Physics C) it's not bad.","This was a great class, and I think I learned a lot about how to approach physics problems. Relativity was awesome, and worth taking the class for that. The lectures were a bit unclear, but if you do the psets with friends and do a lot of practice problems you'll be fine.","This course required a lot of time.  Lectures + lab + section + psets = a large chunk of your time.  You will learn a lot, but sometimes you'll be up at 4 am working on your pset and wondering if all that extra effort is worth it.","Unless you have an extremely concrete reason for taking this course (i.e. you are ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you want to concentrate in physics) I would absolutely not recommend it. It will eat all of your time and make you more stressed than you ever thought was possible. This class was more time consuming and more difficult than all three of my other courses this term put together. The problem sets will make you want to cry. They are tedious and seem to be designed more to intimidate than to actually help you learn. I did not enjoy this class at all.","Although I would recommend this class for those who have a background in physics, those wishing to take it merely to fill requirements should opt out for another lesson. I'm planning on concentrating in physics, and so my two main options were 15a or 16; I took 16 for the first 5 weeks or so, but dropped down to 15a because I didn't want to be constantly bogged down by the endless flow of struggle and agony that is physics 16. This doesn't mean that 15a is a light course, though. I would suggest that only those thinking of concentrating in physics should take 15a, since it requires a good deal of out-of-lecture work that most non-physics people tend not to appreciate.","It is very hard and the homework sets are too long in addition to extra lectures, lab, and lab assignments. I would tell them to be prepared to spend 20-30 hours a week on this class.","First. It's a physics course. Be on top of material presented in class. Practice your problem-solving skills. Try to learn to think like a physicist.\r\nSecond. Exams and lectures are a little hit and miss. Just don't fall behind.\r\nThird. GO TO PHYSICS NIGHT AND LEARN THINGS.","Make sure you already know the material, in order to do well.","Don't take it unless you have to","The class is pretty much what you'd expect: challenging, but you'll learn a lot. Unfortunately how quickly you grasp the material depends primarily on which TF you have because, at least for me, that's where my learning took place (try to get Prahar!!).","I would not recommend this class if you don't enjoy physics purely on its own - and if you're not a physics concentrator, I would highly recommend looking at other options to fulfill the physics requirement if that's why you're looking into this class.","This course is much more time-consuming than it first appears (2 1.5 hour lectures, 2-hour lab section, 1.5 hour section, long psets and lab assignments).","Be warned. It is difficult, and it ruined the love of physics I had coming into college. That being said, it is the lesser of two evils (if you have your heart set on taking physics), as Physics 16 was way worse. (I was in that class for 3 weeks, but should've gotten out sooner.)","Don't do it. It's a simple as that. You will not learn anything new, you'll just be confused about the physics that you already know. Do Physics 12 or one of the 100-level courses, but do not do physics 15 or 16.","I was not a huge fan of this class. That's not to say that others didn't enjoy it; there were definitely aspiring physics-concentrators who got a lot out of pulling all-nighters to get the problem sets done (and thinking on it, those are probably the people best suited for choosing this concentration anyway). As a biomedical engineering concentrator, I definitely wanted a rigorous, more math-y physics class; although I'm also pre-med, I didn't want to take PS2, since I wanted a \"real\", not-watered down physics class full of other pre-meds. In general though, I just thought this class was badly taught. I often left lecture feeling very confused, and ended up having to attend multiple optional sections throughout the week - in addition to spending most of the night at Physics Night in Lev - to get the problem sets done. On that note, \"getting problem sets done\" is not equivalent to understanding the material - even now that the class is done, I feel very uncomfortable with most of the material still. At the same time, I'm hesitant to outright discourage anyone from taking 15a - perhaps I just wasn't prepared enough coming into this class. In high school I had a semester of honors mechanics, and I had initially thought I was good at it, until this class. Others in the class, like I said before, didn't have as much as a struggle as I did, but, again, it's just something to think about. Regardless of how comfortable you are with the material, it is a time commitment, and a significant one at that. I spent a good 10-15 hours every week on psets, and that's not including the time spent in class and PSI lab every week. Please, take caution. (On a side note, however, special relativity, although it's a pain at first, was one of the things that DID end up clicking for me, and it's a pretty cool - if not very practical - topic.)","It is a hard class because the material is difficult. But, it is structured very well.","The course is rewarding, but it does require a large amount of work and is quite difficult in nature.","Take it only if you do not have the time or energy for 16. Otherwise, I feel like if you have a fairly good background in physics and love mechanics, do go for 16 - or at least try it out for a little bit.","Everybody should explore the subject of physics to some extent. It teaches a way of thinking and problem solving that can't be found in other classes or other sciences. It encourages group discussion and serious thought. That being said, this class was not very interesting or well taught. While I could appreciate the subject matter, the lectures were painfully boring and the tests painfully difficult.","It is more difficult than an intro class. Background in physics would be very helpful.","Only take this course if you are very confident in your Physics understanding, if you absolutely require this course for your concentration, or if for some reason you want to be a Physics concentrator.","If there is ANY possible way you can take physics 16, take it. 15A is just not worth it. Lectures are not very helpful, PSETs would be fair if they were paired with effective lecturing, but since lecture is lacking PSETs can be difficult. Expect to have to go to Lev on Wednesday nights to finish them. Also, be prepared for mandatory outside of class time 'extra' lectures. Bottom line: avoid at all cost.","Only take this class if you really like physics.  Otherwise, you'll be doing a lot of work for a class that just isn't that great.","If you're interested in learning mechanics or getting more solid foundation in it, definitely take this course.","Whether you are a pre-med, bio, philosophy, language arts, etc. concentrator, this class helps you understand all the fundamental principles in life and will always be applicable in real life. Great class.","It is the introductory course for physics but you do need to have some background already.","Physics 15a is Harvard's introductory physics course. It should be expected at a university of this caliber with as strong a physics department as it does that it will offer only the finest, most challenging intro curriculum it can. 15a does not disappoint. For those without a strong physics background (Physics C and more), this will be a very challenging course, even if you have a strong interest. That said, the resources are available and extremely useful. The course staff are here to help and they do so with care and compassion. You will leave this course with a firm knowledge of physics that will really open your eyes. The exams are difficult, but that is to your advantage; do not be discouraged if you score poorly. Poorly is average on these exams. Physics 15a is exactly the type of course students should take in order to adjust to college academics. Only through challenges can one actually grow and learn using creative problem solving strategies. Creative problem solving is definitely the number one thing everyone learns in this course. Also, the physics community is so nice and inclusive that you never feel competition; in fact, many of my best friends were made in this class.","Don't take this class with Joao. I'm sure other teachers are better. Material is interesting.","If you are taking this class for a grade and not because you enjoy the subject or think it will help with pre-med requirements don't expect to enjoy this class. It is much better if you take the class for the learning experience rather than stressing about the grade","if you like problem solving, the psets are great material. there are some bs components to the grading scheme however, like quizzes and \"class participation\"","Be ready to really study and put in a lot of hours.","if you have an alternative, go with that","Unless you are a physics professor you will not do well in this class.","You really need at least some high school physics\/mechanics background coming in. Once you get used to how they do things, it's not such a difficult class, but it does take a lot of time and effort every week. If Joao is lecturer again, I wouldn't necessarily recommend the course because his lectures were dry and uninspiring. But the TF's are good and so is the lab component and problem sets. I'd recommend it if you want to really do physics, this is the course for you!","The problem sets are very difficult and will take around 7-9 hours to complete a week. I do suggest that you do a little research on your own via the textbook or the internet. (Many of the concepts are taken from David Morin's textbook. I suggest you check out\/borrow that book even though the course textbook is Giancoli's.)","Be prepared to spend a lot of time doing problem sets. You won't sleep on wednesdays.","I really enjoy physics so this is a necessary step in pursuing that interest, plus I think everyone should take a physics class.","The professor is really a great guy who wants to help you learn. If you have taken AP Physics C and single variable calculus, this class should not really be your hardest class, but do expect to spend around 10 hours a week in order to gain a firm grasp of the material. For me, this was without using the textbook at all, but focusing on thinking through each pset problem. If there are practice exams from previous years, do them. They will prepare you for the exam, and build your intuition and problem solving skills.","Note that the instructor for Physics 15a changes each semester, so this may not apply. Joao truly made physics 15a this semester a perfect experience for me. Having come from AP Physics C in high school, I wanted more than just a recap of mechanics. Fortunately, he included special lectures (Fourier Transforms, Particle Physics, Lagragians) and a little bit of mathematical nuance that made this course much more interesting than its 11a counterpart. Prof Joao also made good use of Morin's textbook, which was mathematically challenging but also incredibly fulfilling. Exams and problem sets were tough, but a solid course overall.","material is challenging both because it is inherently so, but also because it may be hard to learn on your own if you miss lecture","Don't be tricked into thinking this class is an easy alternative to the infamous Physics 16. It's still a very difficult class, even though the first few psets may lead you to believe otherwise. Also, don't underestimate the midterms, which are pretty dang brutal.","15a was a good class, but the problem sets are extremely difficult and often only partially related to the proof-based lecture material. Many of the problems required \"physical intuition\" or a certain multi-step problem-solving method to start properly. (If you went to office hours, you could start to learn how to approach problems yourself, but that was not generally taught in lecture.) However, the demonstrations in lecture were fun and the \"Physics Night\" question session was very helpful for homework assignments.","If you're not going to be a physics or math major, this class could be very difficult.","I'd say buy Morin's text without thinking twice. Also, solving the pset might be daunting just by itself, so either use office hours, or make it a point to go through some of the solved problems in Morin.","Joao spends too much time deriving equations rather than explaining approaching problems. We spend too much time on algebra and doing problems rather than tackling different problem scenarios-- this lack of learning how to approach problems is best reflected in the low midterm averages, one of which was a 54. Even though the pests take an insane amount of time, they have built my confidence in problem solving in physics as well as math. Only take it if you are certain you will do physics or engineering, because this class takes a ton of time.","Do not take this class if Joao is lecturing. He is incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent, but his teaching abilities do not reflect this. Lecture is honestly counterproductive and you might as well just look up the material online. If you truly are interested in Physics, take 16. It's graded better (no final, better curve) but is very difficult conceptually. The problem sets are more interesting and Georgi teaches must better than Joao, and bonding over Physics 16 problem sets is a rite of passage for physics students at Harvard . If I could have rechosen my first physics class here I would. TAKE 16!","This course is difficult, and has a fairly hefty workload, but if you manage your time, it isn't unreasonable. You'll leave the course definitely feeling like you understand the concepts better than you did, if not understand them period.","If you're not a physics concentrator and don't have a deep and abiding love for physics, you're probably biting off more than you can chew with this class. Problem sets took me 10-15 hours a week (to give some context for that statement, that's upwards of three times as long as I needed for CS50 psets). I took this because my CPB concentration has a physics requirement and I have an allergy against courses that use cute names like \"physical sciences\" instead of just physics... but I will likely be taking AP50b for the second half of the requirement, because I don't think I can handle more of this. Partly it was Joao's abysmal lecturing that made this course so difficult, but I think it would've been pretty demanding regardless of who was teaching.","to change the high school approach to physics and develop an understanding of physics and not to memorize the stuff","The problems on psets and exams are tricky. If you focus on doing and understanding the psets and doing a few practice exams, you should be ok. Don't just take answers from friends because it's gonna be hard to internalize all the theory right before the exams.","Relativity is confusing as hell.","This class took up a LOT of time. Section, PSI, Lectures, psets, lab project papers, PSI assignments, SPECIAL LECTURES... It can also feel very frustrating coming out of lecture, looking at the homework, and having very little idea where to start. For me, it wasn't really until section that you get exposure to \"how to approach homework problems\", and usually that meant cramming the homework the night before it's due in Lev dhall. Nevertheless, you do come out of the course with a good understanding of mechanics, and perhaps a not so good understanding of relativity. I wouldn't suggest you take this course for fun.","Physics 15a, at least when it is taught by Joao, is not a very good course. The lectures are often unintelligible, the exams ridiculously difficult for no particular reason, and the problem sets ambiguous. Mostly, the physics for a problem is very straightforward; they just make the algebra\/calculus really obtuse, and that's where you loose points. Don't go into this course thinking that it will be easy because it is not Physics 16. I received a 5 on the AP Physics C: Mechanics exam, and found this course to be much more difficult than I originally thought. If you are on the border between 15a and 16, take 16. It will be harder, but you will probably get a better grade\/not absolutely hate attending 8+ of lecture\/section\/lab each week (underneath 5 hr psets). If you haven't done math ( >= BC calc) \/ have never done physics, take a lower course. This course would be outrageous if you haven't seen any mechanics before.","This wasn't a terrible class. The TFs are truly wonderful people and I learned a lot. This class covers way more material compared to things like AP50a (what on earth is that anyway...no lectures? just discussions? I'm sorry, what are you learning?) and PS2 (please, premeds) so this class is worth it in the end.","This class is extremely difficult.","This was easily the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Joao seems like a nice dude, but he is a terrible lecturer. None of the material is presented the right way for students to get a clear grasp of what's going on, Joao just starts right in on a problem and introduces new equations as he goes along, so none of what he's doing is ever really explained. All of the learning happens in section, but that's not really enough time to get all of what you need to do the psets. There is an excessive amount of homework (partially due to the fact that even the simple problems are ten times more difficult when none of the unit's concepts have been formally introduced to you before), and the exams were unnecessarily complicated. This is supposed to be an introductory physics class, but I'd say my AP physics class in high school gave me a more comprehensive conceptual understanding of physics than did this class.","Do not simply take this class because you enjoyed physics (even AP Physics C: Mechanics) in high school. The weekly problem sets will be more difficult, time-consuming, and often theoretical. That being said, if you put in the time and really learn the material, you will come out of this course with a thorough background in mechanics. The special relativity component of the course is very interesting. Joao is not a good lecturer. Lectures are unorganized\/unclear and often confusing and unable to be followed - and often do not help much with the problem sets. The PSI lab component of the course is uninteresting and does not even remotely relate to the physics being learned in 15a - it is more of a more of statistics course than anything else."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Section is really important, and GO TO PHYSICS NIGHT!","This class is really tough and Georgi can be infuriating to work with. Only take it if you think you're interested in physics.","This course is for brave individuals. Be ready for long Physics PSET nights, lots of collaboration and confusion, and a sense that you didn't learn as much as you should have.","If they love physics, take it, but it is difficult and at times feels like you aren't learning a lot of actual material.","Unless you are extremely passionate about physics, have a strong grasp of both the math behind physics and general principles about how the physical world works, and have a lot of time you are willing to dedicate to reading course materials and working on the problem set, the class gets extremely frustrating because you feel lost a lot of the time and the lectures are not very clear. Be prepared for a lot of self-studying.","you can't judge this course from first 4 weeks; the rest is considerably harder. (time dilation and rotation stuff were cosmic)","Howard Georgi is probably the smartest person I've ever met. If you are extremely enthusiastic about Physics, and already want to take Physics 16, then go for Physics 16 with him. But if you're not that into physics (not physics-16-into physics), and Georgi is teaching it, stay away because it will be horribly tough. There is nothing wrong about the course in itself, it's just misleading to call it 15a if Georgi is teaching it because he will keep it almost the same level as 16. if you're just taking this class to see if you like physics enough to concentrate in it, or if you're just taking it cause you like Physics (not madly in love with it that you want it to consume your life), then stay away from Georgi's class.","This is a hard class at the best of times, from what I've heard. It seems that Professor Georgi's spin on the class makes it even tougher. I wouldn't discourage anyone from taking the class, but would say that it will be very difficult if you haven't taken a fair bit of physics in the past and also don't have experience with multivariable calculus.\r\nAlso, I often found that both lecture and the textbook failed to help me understand the material, and this was frustrating. Section was really great, but insufficient to make up for some of the other shortcomings of the class. Without physics night, I would not have been able to do the psets. As a result, physics night is a late and often unpleasant night.\r\nAs a summary of my feelings about the class, I would simply say this did not feel at all like an introductory\/entry-level class to me. I felt like a lot was assumed about how much I knew coming into the class.","You will not understand every thing, but it is fun.","Despite the tremendous challenge this course offers, I would ultimately recommend taking it. Dr. Georgi is a tremendous lecturer and an all-around genius whose unique perspectives on physics and its relationships with the universe will make you really feel classical mechanics \"in your bones\".","Physics Night is your friend. You're going to hate the P-sets, because they're difficult. However, going to Physics Night is the best way to get them done well and in a reasonable amount of time. Also, don't worry if Georgi tears your project apart when you present, he pretty much does that to everyone and most people still get decent project grades anyway.","This class is really hard.  The Psets get progressively harder but the quiz-every-week structure is great.  Hopefully they will get a better, simpler text book.","Professor Georgi is helpful in 1 on 1 conversations, but in lecture he can be quite confusing. He is very open to questions though so do not be afraid to ask questions in class because they will make the difference!","This is the most disappointing class I have yet taken at Harvard.  I was very excited to take my first physics course here because I wanted a very strong foundation. I was very wrong. This course assumed a lot of background physics and I feel that I need to go back and teach myself everything I missed. I harbor no positive feelings towards any elements of this course.","Cool class, you should still take the fall class though","This class was fun sometimes and devastatingly painful at others. The psets are extremely difficult and practically impossible to do alone. Groups are necessary in order to do well. The lectures are horrible and extremely hard to learn from. The book is equally as awful. The topics were interesting though, and the lab component of the course was great!","Good class, but be prepared to do a lot of work, and spend a lot of time in Lev D-Hall.","The course covered diverse and interesting topics in mechanics. The demonstrations are a lot of fun. The problem sets were tricky and needed guidance but well done. However be warned: with Pr. Georgi as an instructor this class is very close to physics 16 and has all its woes: most importantly, the lectures are very confusing. Very clear sections made up for this sometimes. Finally participating in physics nights was a big plus.","Great class, very interesting format and teaching style","This class is definitely difficult and challenging, at least with my background and comfort with the material, but if you put in the effort and communicate with the faculty and teaching staff when you're falling behind, you can be pretty successful in the course."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It is an amazing class when taken with Morin. He is very good at lectures, there are plenty of examples, he is very organized and so are his notes. The staff is great, so helpful, you make awesome friends over the pset and get through each one so not incredibly stressful. Exams are fine if you study the homework. Overall, its a hard class but you learn a lot and are helped a lot during the process.","This is a difficult class.","You will definitely learn a lot about physics, but you have to put in the time yourself. The problem sets alone are probably not enough preparation for the exams so it's good to do extra problems out of the book as a supplement.","Professor Morin is a phenomenal lecturer, and is very accessible outside of class. The problem sets can be difficult, but doing them at Wednesday Physics Nights in Leverett are a great way of \"bonding by fire\" with other physics students. The course is very well organized, and the demos during lecture are fantastic.","Be ready: this course will be very difficult. If you are a freshman taking this course \"instead of 16\", you will be challenged.","Great course. If you're considering doing 16, definitely start there and then drop down if you need to. Reading the lecture notes in advance probably helps a lot, but is not necessary.","If you have a required physics course and took AP Physics C: Mechanics in high school, Physics 15a with Dr. Morin is a great choice. It was a better fit for me than Physics 16 (from which I switched into 15a).","If you choose to take this class, just know that you are going to have to put a lot of time into it. This class is not impossible if you give yourself enough time to do everything, but I think doing things with not enough time is what makes this class hard.","Professor Morin was amazing. He explained topics with so much clarity that even though the material was difficult, I never felt overwhelmed. Tests were also very fair. If Professor Morin teaches it again, take this class!","Very insightful. Useful even if you have taken AP-level physics.","The tragedy of introductory physics at this school is that there is no way to simultaneously achieve the goals of 1) taking an interesting introductory mechanics course and 2) actually sleeping seven nights a week. 15a exhibits precisely the features that make big introductory science lectures infamously soul-sucking. You get what you signed up for: conceptually tame, challengingly nitpicky material and assignments and oddly difficult exams. PSI shouldn't really factor into your considerations; it's a really relaxed intro to basic data analysis techniques, and you pretty much just have to show up once a week and play with things. David Morin is the bright spot in this dull picture because he's super devoted, accessible, and kind, but even he did not manage to shake the paradigm of introductory science classes that almost seem designed to turn away creative students. I really recommend against taking this course if your primary motivation for taking physics is to get a picture of what physics as a discipline tells us about the world - this is a course about learning tools to apply to pset problems.","Please try to have a strong foundation of physics before going into the course, as it will only help.","This class is very challenging, but you won't regret taking it because you learn a lot and it's very rewarding.","This course is billed as a normal introductory physics course for people interested in concentrating in physics, chemistry or another science. Supposedly, if you've taken calculus and a little bit of physics in high school you'll be prepared. I had done these things (2 years of physics, 1 and a half of calculus) and felt totally unprepared. It got better over the semester, but every pset was a huge struggle. I had to learn how to think about physics and solving physics problems in a whole new way. Psets usually took me between 6 and 16 hours a week. I highly advise working in groups. Also redo the pests before exams and do lots of practice tests.\nI should also mention that I had this experience when Dr. Morin was teaching 15a and he's supposedly the best teacher in the physics department.","Great physics class, you learn a lot but at a fast pace. Take if you are comfortable with physics.","So the big question is: should I take Physics 16 or Physics 15a. If you would consider yourself a physics \"enthusiast,\" then take 16. It will expose you to many abstract concepts that you may not encounter for a while. But if you love doing physics, then I would go with 15a. It is framed to help you, above all, understand physics. This does not mean by any means that it is easy; it may require some extra textbook reading. But the psets are manageable and collaboration actually enhances your performance, rather than just being desperate to get them done. To do well in the course, start out well; if you start with the right momentum, you will be prepared to do well throughout the course.","An excellent intro course to mechanics and relativity.  I took this to fulfill the physics pre-med requirement because it is so much more fulfilling and interesting than PS2.  I had never taken physics before and wish I had taken this course as a freshman, so even if you are thinking about possibly concentrating in physics or have even taken physics, shop the course and see if it interests you!","It's a great course and professor Morin is a great lecturer.","It's a very challenging class if you lack a physics background, but it is very interesting.","I'd recommend Physics 15a to any aspiring physics student. The instruction is top notch and the content is engaging. Try your best to enjoy physics night.","Morin is a great professor, and physics night at Leverett is a wonderful time!","Absolutely take this class if you want to learn a TON about physics and to learn how to think in a new, different way. Professor Morin is an amazing lecturer, and the material is difficult but digestible if you work hard. The course also teaches a new method to problem solving that I had never learned before; I think I am a better scientist as a result of it.","Dr. Morin is a good lecturer who sets up some great physics demos.  The material very interesting for the most, and even with a strong background in high school physics, one learns a lot. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in physics.","Although the material can be quite challenging, the resources at your disposal are endless. You will have to struggle through some problem sets, but if you work through them with other students or by looking through lecture materials, you can eventually get to an answer.","Be aware that you're going to have to put in a lot of work! It's an intense class, perhaps not as bad as 16, but still requires a good amount of work.","It will be rough, but you will get through it if you have friends to do psets with. You will also learn an incredible amount of physics and feel super smart.","It's certainly not easy, especially in regards to exams, but it's definitely worthwhile.  You'll probably have to take it if you have any interest in learning physics.  Those of you who want to devote your whole lives to this type of class can go take Physics 16, but if not, this is the class for you, since here you'll learn actual physics (sorry AP50 & PS2\/3) at a rigorous level (sorry PS12).  The problem sets are challenging, but you have great resource in the form of office hours, where you can literally sit in Morin's office for hours just working on the problem set and asking him any questions, as well as Physics Night, where you have access to not just Morin but also each other, and my god the problem sets are so much better when you're working in groups, can't stress this enough.  Morin is also fantastic, although at times I would find myself overwhelmed I could always find solace in going to his office hours and having him explain a concept, which he was always willing to do however many times it took for me to get it just right.  Overall, be ready for a challenge, but a worthwhile one.","This class really helps develop a very good understanding of a wide variety of 2D mechanics and 1D relativity problems.","It's a good course, and well taught, but it is difficult. You'll have to spend a pretty good amount of time on it, especially without any physics background.","Don't take it. Stick to 12a or PS2","(Disclaimer: I am a potential Physics concentrator) Professor Morin is very accessible and a good lecturer.  The demos are cool.  P-Sets can be difficult, but are usually solvable without too much headache.  Section can be good or bad depending on your TF.  Lab assignments are fairly easy.   Do the P-Set over the weekend (Assigned Thursday, due next Thursday), instead of during the week.  It not worth putting it off.","Take this course when Morin is teaching it. The psets require a good deal of time, but if you start a few days beforehand then you will never need to stay up ridiculously late working on them.","Its bloody hard.","This course provides an interesting education in mechanics, although it is perhaps the best fit for those whose concentrations require it.","This class does an amazing job teaching all the concepts within the syllabus.","Don't expect this class to be a walk in the park. You'll probably have to start the pSets at least 6 days in advance if you don't want to be panicking at Physics Night at Levrett every Wednesday.","If you haven't taken mechanics before, this class will be hell unless you are a math genius. This class will ruin your life if you aren't gaga for physics.","Be prepared to put in the work. Morin is a great professor so try and take it with him. Other than that, just a lot of material to cover but it is rewarding.","Morin is an effective lecturer; class material takes time to digest and do psets, so be ready for a good amount of work. It is a fair class but pretty high expectations","Physics 15a, especially with Morin, is exceptional. Lectures are very informative, and the in-class examples and demos really help with learning concepts and gaining an intuition for the subject material.\n\nIf you are choosing between this class and a class like 12a, I would say go ahead and take this class. It will probably be more work, but if you go in with the right attitude you will enjoy every minute of it.","Difficult for sure but Professor Morin makes it worth it and you learn A LOT by the end of the semester","If you are not truly invested in learning the material and are not overly interested in physics this course probably is not for you. However it is a really well taught course and a majority of the teaching staff really wants to see you learn and understand the material. They are passionate about the material and they try their best to make it interesting with really cool demos. One of my favorite things about the staff was how open they were to discussing topics in physics even if they were beyond or below the course - not in class but during office hours or in emails.","I love mechanics and the way it gets you to think. This course forces you to get a great understanding for basic mechanics.","It's not for the faint of heart.","Such a great class! Best intro class I have taken (among many) at Harvard. Phenomenal teaching staff, really interesting problem sets, helpful section, and a well-integrated lab component. Take it even if physics scares you a bit!","Only take this class if you have your heart set on being a physics concentrator. Even then, it might change your mind. If you simply want to try out physics, take an easier class.","Very difficult and theoretical, but a good introduction to physics and mechanics.","Very good course with interesting and exciting material. The lab section is wide open so you need good self drive to engage in lab. The material is incredibly difficult. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on P-sets and studying for tests. Take a light schedule with this course!","Your enjoyment of the course really depends on who you are. This is a very extremely difficult course and struggling through the psets is not always that exciting, but if you have a good study group\/friends in the course (I made a lot of friends by taking it!) you'll get through it together and feel accomplished afterwards.","This class is difficult but you leave with an expansive knowledge of mechanics. This is a great course to learn mechanics if you are willing to put in the time.","This class might look intimidating, but it's really a fantastic course. You'll learn so much about physics and how physicists think. Especially take this class if it is taught by Professor Morin! He is by far the best.","It is best taken as a second, more in-depth exposure to mechanics.","This course is designed for potential physics concentrators. Do not take if you are not planning on studying higher level physics.","This class is physics for physics' sake. It covers a good deal of material and applications are lacking, but if that's what interests you, take the course. It's bit of a challenge, but a reasonable one. You make good friends at physics night, and you walk away with a strong understanding of mechanics.","The course is fun and the professor is amazing.
