He'll ask some pretty hard\/interesting questions, but it's okay if you don't have an answer. He's jokes are sometimes actually funny.","A great way to further your study of immunology and to get better at critically reading and presenting papers!","This is an amazing chance to have in-depth discussion about cutting-edge discoveries in immunology with science legends (and legends in the making). By the end of this course, you shouldn't just be able to understand immunology research articles with the best of them, but you'll be asking questions like: Do I trust this data? What else could this mean? What experiments should have been done\/could be done? Put in the work (i.e. struggle to understand the readings) and you will be rewarded.","Make sure presentation is the only thing you have to worry about that week. Contact TF to go over your presentation so that the facts are correct. Ask TFs for help rather than go searching for the answer in reviews on your own...","Take this course if you're interested in studying immunology. Don't underestimate how much time it will take to create a good presentation. Take MCB169 first.","This is an excellent course on immunology, provided you have some basic background. You will get the most out of this course after taking MCB 169. The guest lecturers are hit or miss, but 90% they were hits. You read the latest research papers, and talk about the latest advances. Whether you want to buff up your paper-speed-reading skills, or just want to learn what's going on in the world of immunology, you can't ask for anything more.","This is a fairly phenomenal course with great readings every week (barring a few) - it is tough subject material though!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class was AWESOME. It really gets you think outside of the box, think critically about scientific papers, never take things at face value, and hone in your scientific mind.","Guest lectures are good. Paper presentation was fun and so was the discussion.","This is a great class in terms of material and workload. A wide range of diverse topics in immunology are covered so you really have an opportunity to expand your knowledge of the field, especially after a class like MCB 169, which is very much focused on memorizing the basics. The workload is also extremely manageable, only paper reading and a couple of presentations. My one caveat is that the actual class period can be very dull at times; it can be hard to focus on some of the drier topics and presentations, especially over a two hour period.","This is a great class! Take it if you are interested in immunology.","This class is all about reading and presenting papers, and it's hard to find another class with as engaging a format. Do the paper readings and participate in discussion, and you'll get a lot out of it and learn about some cutting-edge immunology.","I HIGHLY recommend this course. The teaching staff consists of some of the most brilliant minds in biology and you learn so much from this course. The course load is manageable and the topics are very interesting. Take this course!","You should be very interested in immunology if you take this class. If you didn't take MCB 169, you will likely be lost much of the time, but you can still take a lot away from the guest lecturers' talks. The papers are great, and you can read them no matter what your knowledge level is, but you might have to spend some more time getting comfortable with all the immunology terminology. Professor Strominger is fantastic -- he makes really insightful comments and tells great stories!!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.24","workload":"1.94","difficulty":"2.76","recommendation":"4.53","enrollment":"18","response rate":"94.44","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCRB 178","course_id":"4891","cat_num":"2196","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SCRB 178","course_id":"4891","cat_num":"2196","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCRB 178","course_id":"4891","cat_num":"2196","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
