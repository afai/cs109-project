'08":{"comments":["Don't let this course turn you off from the rest of the religion department's courses, which are better-taught and more focused. On the upside, you'll get to be in a class with all the other religion concentrators in your year; their intelligence and diversity of backgrounds definitely was the saving grace of the course.","The number of undergraduates in the Study of Religion at Harvard is really small - this course not only provides a good solid background on what your major will be like, but also enables you to meet usually all of the other concentrators in your class year, and take a course with all of them for a semester.","This is a really good introductory course into different methodologies of studying religion.  Theoretical models and practical surveys are discussed, and some discussion concerning relating material to current religious thought and current religious trends is pursued.  Much of the motivation and impetus in the class will have to be yours, though -- the excitement comes from your discussion group and any supplementary stuff outside of the actual class material you will probably need to seek out for yourself or ask the professor about specifically.  Stay on top of your game, though, and the class itself can teach you a lot!","It is a good introduction to studying religion."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This course is like Expos, except it succeeds where Expos generally fails. By taking this course, you will learn how to think critically, articulate a coherent and worthwhile thesis, and write fluently and concisely.","Professor Jones is awesome, and its fun to have class with all the other concentrators in your class.","be ready to discuss and defend your opinions.","This course is what you make of it, like many in college.  Read what excites you; listen carefully (attendance is VERY important).  Take out all of the books from the library.","You will love it!  It may just be your favorite class this semester.","If you're a religion concentrator, you're going to have to take it. It's OK though, because you'll probably like it a lot.","Highly engaging, well structured to encourage lively discussions, and a wonderful professor -- I have nothing but the best to say about this course","This class is enormously intellectually and personally stimulating.","Professor Tamsin Jones has all of the qualities of a good professor: she explains topics thoroughly and clearly, she has a sense of humor, she interacts with students, and she is fair.  The course material is mostly interesting with a few exceptions for dry material.  The tutorial will make you think about religion in ways you probably haven't thought of before."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["An excellent introduction to the study of religion.  The readings are really great, try your best not to skip too many, or you'll miss out on some interesting discussions.","Section leaders were great, discussion could have been mediated better but as long as you're comfortable speaking in class it's a valuable learning experience","TAKE IT, even though you probably already have to. It's a great way to get to know your fellow concentrators and made me love the religion department.","Great tutorial! Choose the Study of Religion! The readings and instructors are great, and the class is week after week of heated discussion between people you will become friends with very quickly.","I've never been in a course where the students were so engaged and excited to discuss the reading material. The tutorial students all bonded to a degree that I have not experienced in the past. Friends outside the classroom were able to openly and dynamically disagree with each other inside the classroom, which I believe says a lot about the comfort level of the fostered, academic environment.","great class, a chance to bond with fellow religion concentrators and think about the study of religion itself","Make sure you understanding each of the readings.","Make sure to do the readings! Class is boring if you don't know what is being discussed."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class is fantastic! Concentrators have to take it, but it isn't a boring requirement. The readings are interesting, and the classroom discussions are always interesting.","The most enjoyable and fulfilling required course I've taken.","This course really guides you in your learning but really stimulates your thinking. You of course don't learn about any one religion; it's actually very theory based. I really enjoyed learning the types of questions that scholars consider and the methods they use for answering them.","one of the best courses I'll ever take.","This course made me realize how much I love my concentration! It was an excellent grounding in what it means to study religion and has been a necessary and important part of my academic study. It encouraged us to really grapple with the complexities of this field and ended up demonstrating that this complexity is what makes it so exciting. I loved coming to class every week and loved doing the readings.","One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you are even remotely interested in the academic study of religion, take this class. It is challenging, thought provoking, stress-free and small -- everything a Harvard class should be. Even you aren't concentrating in religion, I cannot stress how worthwhile this opportunity is.","This course does a great job of making you think differently about religion and the theories and methods behind it. Great discussions, great instructor. The course will make you a more articulate writer and better thinker.","This class opens your mind in ways you never thought possible. In such a small class setting we see such diversity. There were nine of us and out of that nine we had one interested in Hinduism, one interested in Mysticism, one interested in Christian ministry, one interested in Islam, one interested in Jewish studies, one interested in religion and philosophy, we can get such a mixed bag in such a small setting which is incredible. We do not just share our knowledge with one another but we share our experiences. Take this class if you like that sense of community where you can bond with your peers and with your instructor on an academic level as well as a deep personal and emotional level. I have gone through a lot with these talented people and being with them helped me in ways you could not possibly imagine. Religion 97 is not a class, it is a transformative experience.","Even if you're not a religion concentrator, I would recommend you take this course (is that allowed?).  It taught me so much about how to think sensitively about a broad range of topics, and how to apply a critical eye to what can be a very personal area of life. This made me so excited to study religion, and Courtney, the instructor, was the best teacher I have had at Harvard so far.","I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read and discuss the material covered in this class -- I knew that it was important for me to be familiar with it, but it's easy at Harvard to skip foundational texts and take only classes that interest you. Exploring different theories in the study of religion allowed me to focus my preferences for the rest of my studies in the department. Additionally, the tutorial had a great group, and I found myself learning something from my classmates each session.","Great tutorial, equips you with so many of the tools you'll need in the study of religion.","Great course; gives the student examples of a variety of approaches to analyzing religion."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The course is incredible if you put in the work required. If you prepare by doing the readings, and get started on the papers early there is lots of support and you get a lot more out of the course in the end.","Courtney is such an incredible professor; my favorite class of the semester. If you are at all interested in religion and different approaches to it, or considering the concentration, definitely take this course.","This class is a joy for so many reasons -- the academic environment, the community, the support, the challenging coursework. Take it!","The sophomore tutorial is an amazing theoretical sweep through various methodological approaches to studying religion. It's a lot of reading, but the discussion is incredible."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 97","course_id":"5030","cat_num":"2313","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 97","course_id":"5030","cat_num":"2313","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 97","course_id":"5030","cat_num":"2313","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
