However, the format of the final paper (a non-policy policy piece) is somewhat mysterious, and very difficult to execute - be warned! Consult with Rosen extensively.","Professor Rosen is fantastic and so is this class. Always an enjoyable 2 hours of discussion","if you are genuinely interested in this topic, take this course. Thirty pages is a lot if you are taking this class on a whim, but if this is material you are interested in, don't let 30 pages scare you off.","Rosen is a great teacher but you need to engage with him because the course is brief and you don't get too much out of the coursework. Use it as an opportunity to write your junior paper!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is fantastic.  You learn about a fascinating topic with a great professor, and ultimately show this knowledge in a 30 page paper.","Take this course! The simulations are great and always fun. Rosen is a wonderful lecturer and discussion leader, incredibly adept at incorporating student insights and leaving students with takeaways from each section. The 30 page paper should be started early and it you should consult Rosen extensively - if done correctly, you will walk away having benefitted greatly from the course.","Highly recommended. Professor Rosen is easy to talk to and was highly accessible throughout the semester.","It's difficult, but worth your time."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 94sp","course_id":"2188","cat_num":"6012","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 94sp","course_id":"2188","cat_num":"6012","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 94sp","course_id":"2188","cat_num":"6012","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
