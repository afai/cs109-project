Borges is fascinating and Mariano is one of my favorite professors. Not too much work; fun class.","This class is excellent! Prof. Siskind is quite expert in Borges and really succeeds in bringing the material to life, both through historical contextualizing and literary insights. Even though section did not measure up the high intellectual standards that he set forth in lecture, this class is certainly worthwhile.","Fantastic reading list - getting to delve into a single author, especially one as complex and fascinating as Borges, is really a treat. Mariano has wonderful things to say about the stories and essays (in fact, I would have preferred that the lecture-discussion be more of an outright lecture). A high level of spoken and written Spanish is definitely necessary, and I would say that if you have a background in literary analysis (rather than just Spanish language) you will be set.","This was a great class. Borges is wonderfully interesting, and Prof. Siskind's interest in the subject does Borges justice. You will learn a ton. You will get more out of 20 pages a week than you ever thought you could. Assignments are incredibly manageable. Only downside was a seminar-type class that also had section, so you really had to be prepared for 3 hours of discussion per week. Aside from that, nothing to complain about. Very reasonable assessments, excellent teaching staff.","This class is great because it is intensive as opposed to extensive; you don't read a ton, but you'll work in detail on the things you do read. Lectures are engaging, but you don't get the historical and cultural contexts you need to understand parts of the material until you get to class.","A very interesting class. I found my self wishing it would be a bit more demanding, though - more opportunities to write would have really helped me digest the material. Rosario was a great TF.","This was an enriching opportunity to dive deeper into one author, a chance we rarely get with the contemporary, broad way of looking at things.","Loved this class! The readings are all super interesting (and you can find English translations easily to make sure you're following everything if needed). Mariano is so much fun to listen to and talk with, as were the TFs this year, Alba & Rosario.","Great course, not a lot of work, very interesting, great teaching staff."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you're curious about Borges's work, would like to read more of it, or would just like to talk about it and have it thoroughly elucidated by Mariano Siskind, take this class. Advanced Spanish skills are necessary insofar as you'd probably want to understand what Prof. Siskind is saying, yet the \"flexible language policy\" he espouses makes it so that your spoken Spanish doesn't have to be perfect at all. Although lectures and readings are mostly in Spanish, you can speak Spanglish or even outright English if you want. The atmosphere is convivial and sort of cafe-like; you can talk when you want, interrupt lecture with interesting ideas, and bring in outside knowledge if its relevant. Prof. Siskind is a total insider with respect to contemporary Latin American literature\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe knows the game and might even set up a Skype meeting in class with a notable Argentine writer like he did this semester. He's also extremely accessible, overwhelmingly knowledgable, and always happy to chat with undergrads. If any of the above sounds enticing, take this class.","Borges! Mariano y Jer\u00c3\u00b3nimo le dan vida a los textos de Borges. Borges es dif\u00c3\u00adcil leer y entender - todo lo que aparece ser es pero al mismo tiempo no es - y entonces es muy padre poder estudiar a Borges con profesores que les encantan sus textos. Tu como lector tambi\u00c3\u00a9n le das vida a Borges con tu nueva lectura. Aprendes mucho - como pensar, como escribir, como deducir! Es una clase muy buena. Si te gusta la literatura o el lenguaje espa\u00c3\u00b1ol, toma la clase!","Great class! Mariano is a great professor and keeps up the enthusiasm throughout the semester. He is also really easy to talk to and connect with, whether about Borges or not. If you're at all interested in learning about Borges, definitely take the class. The workload is very manageable as the class only meets once a week and there isn't a ton of reading. Borges never wrote a novel or anything so you really only read a few short stories or poems per week and discuss them, which is very lax.","This class is incredible, Mariano is incredible, the TFs are incredible, the texts are incredible. It's a must-take at Harvard if you are at all interested in literature, theories of knowledge, or translation.","This course taught me so much about not only Argentine literature, but literature in general. It was an excellent course that taught me how to look at writing in a new light.","This is a phenomenally taught class on Borges. Professor Siskind is obviously passionate about the material and he is extremely friendly and approachable with a great sense of humor. However, Borges is, in my opinion, a fairly dry and repetitive writer. Over the course of the class, I found the short stories were overwhelmingly similar in their style and their \"point.\" If you've already read Borges and you aren't sure you like him, this class is unlikely to change your mind. If you like him or you're unfamiliar, dive right in!","Borges is a wonderful writer, and this class will give you a great overview into his works! Prof. Siskind is passionate about the subject matter, and his enthusiasm really makes the class.","This class is excellent! Prof. Siskind is wonderful. Borges is divine.","I think the class was probably one of my favorites this semester and I think I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spanish literature.","This is an awesome class. The literature of Borges is very challenging in the best possible way. If you like the films of Christopher Nolan or mystery\/detective fiction or complex storylines with huge punch lines or fiction described as history, you'll love the material of this class. I highly recommend it.","Mariano is brilliant and hilarious. Good Spanish comprehension is a must, but don't be scared away if you're rusty - I had to look up every other word in the dictionary but the readings are short enough that that was possible. Highly highly recommend.","SO GREAT. TAKE IT. MIND=BLOWN.","Prof Siskind is wonderful. It's a lot of reading, so be prepared for that. It's not a lot of work besides that, and it's generally very interesting reading. I did find myself a little burnt out on Borges by the end, so also be sure you have a decent amount of prior knowledge on Borges and Argentinian history in general.","If the thought of taking this class has crossed your mind, you should do it. Mariano is a Borges machine, and the workload is very reasonable even if your Spanish abilities are lacking. Don't hesitate to make use of the flexible language policy (class is only conducted in Spanish per the department).","If you know and love Borges, you should take this class because Professor Siskind genuinely loves his works and will teach you about them like no one else can. If you've never heard of Borges, you should also take this class because it'll blow your mind."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"24","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 194","course_id":"4504","cat_num":"25301","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"13"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 194","course_id":"4504","cat_num":"25301","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 194","course_id":"4504","cat_num":"25301","1s":"2","2s":"13","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
