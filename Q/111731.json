You learn a lot of really interesting physics, and get a better handle on quantum mechanics.","It's pretty cool. And not as hard as you think.","For those committed to physics grad school--you'll need to take this as a second semester of quantum mechanics. It's not as physically enlightening as the first, but gives you insight into how to calculate real world problems.","It was difficult and frustrating for me and I don't feel that I learned very much.  Either my preparation was poor, the teaching was poor, or the material was too hard and the books insufficient to learn it.","Its an applications course, so it almost necessarily will be less magical than 143a. Regardless, its a useful class, and you'll learn a lot about a lot of different things.","Keep up with the reading.","Interesting presentation of solid material.","If you want to be a physicist, you need this course. If not, you don't, and you should only take it if you have a strong interest in understanding how the world works."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Take this class to learn some cool physics, but don't necessarily expect to get a comprehensive understanding of every topic. Quantum is really hard.","Ask around about the professor teaching the class.","The material isn't particularly interesting and isn't really presented in an all-too-useful way. There were some glimmers here and there but overall, only take this class if your concentration truly demands it of you.","It's probably the hardest class I've taken here. But it was really interesting, particularly towards the end when we talked about identical particles and applications. I'd recommend reading Griffiths religiously... I wish I had.","Take it for grad school, but just for that reason.","It is a useful course, but it might be more interesting to take more focused higher level courses.","Though I feel painful to deal with the abstract theory, I know how to learn Quantumn now.","Take this course if you're serious about experimental physics.","This is an interesting class, but it is definitely a lot of work. I would only take it if you are considering pursuing physics.","Only take this class if you're interested in becoming a physicist.  It contains interesting applications of quantum mechanics, but there is not really much in the way of \"new\" things to learn.","Have to be strongly interested in physics, and pretty set in it as a long term field.","This course is good. You do learn some useful things. But it could have covered more and what it did cover was covered well in lecture but pretty poorly on the problem sets. Probably depends on who is teaching it. Prof. Doyle is a great teacher.","Only take 143b if you are really interested in really understanding quantum mechanics. If that's the case, go for it! Especially with Prof. Doyle.","Constantly review your 143a notes or the first few chapters of Griffiths.","This class will show you that physics is not mathematics. Introductory classes like 16, 143a, 153, and 181 all brush some aspects of physics under the carpet, making physics seem like math, and this class shows you how this is not so.","This class provides a lot of useful knowledge and is therefore important for a physics major to take. But, be careful of Professor Doyle, as he will probably trick you on something."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["It's great.  Not necessary if you're not a physics major.  If you are, definitely take.","- good stuff!","A good class that will solidify your understanding of quantum mechanics, but that won't teach you anything fundamentally new.","143b is a great course and you should take it if you took 143a. From what I heard from previous years, it was more relaxed and easy than in other years. You get to learn a lot of cool applications of the things you learned in 143a.","Take the class if you specifically want to learn a broad range of applications of quantum mechanics.","If Sachdev is teaching it, brace yourself for graduate-level topics.","Check who's teaching this course and what they plan to cover. It can be very interesting, but the assignments can be tedious at times.","If you have a lot of self discipline, you might as well read Griffiths (plus a few chapters in other books on quantum electrodynamics and relativity) on your own. If not, this class is helpful for teaching you the mathematical methods commonly used in QM. Be prepared for a lot of integrals.","Very interesting class, links abstract (introductory) theory of 143a to real-world problems and applications.","Definitely worth taking after you finish Physics 143a. Provides interesting additional material and some really cool applications.","You should take it if you want to go to grad school in physics, but expect fairly messy calculations.","You get a lot more from taking a full year of quantum mechanics than one semester, and the meat of the subject lies in learning the approximation methods and solving the few fundamental problems.","The material is quite interesting, and at least this year the course was fairly easy (although it has had a reputation for being difficult in past years).  A lot of fun and well worth the time."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Only take it if you really want to learn more quantum.  It's a great class if you're excited about the material, but it will kill you if you aren't that interested.","After this class, I feel like I have an understanding of Quantum that I lacked after simply one semester.","Professor Sachdev really aimed to make this class a learning experience rather than an stress burden. Some topics were really interesting while others were a little dull. I'm glad I took this class!","Take this class if you want to delve deeper into quantum mechanics. It's a good continuation of 143a but you don't HAVE to take it, so don't if you didn't really enjoy 143a. Also, be careful which professor you take it with. Professor Sachdev was great (but I've heard others are not so good).","I think it's a really great course.","If you made it through 143a, you owe it to yourself to take 143b.  All the information I attempted to learn in 143a was solidified, converted into useful, valuable concepts to apply to real-world situations.","This was a cool class with a very manageable workload in my opinion. It's some cool applications of quantum mechanics. Also just taking another class in quantum mechanics totally gives you a better understanding of everything you learned the first time around.","Sachdev is a fantastic lecturer.  I felt like this was as good a physics course as any, with some review of old material, lots of new material, good teaching, reasonable problem sets, and tractable exams.  I would recommend any physics major giving this course strong consideration.","If you are physics major this class is essential to improve your understanding of quantum mechanics and be introduced to a lot of cool stuff. The applications are pretty cool, this theory actually makes legitimate predictions.","I think 143b is a really good addition to 143a in that a lot more interesting and observable aspects of quantum mechanics are covered.  Professor Sachdev is an excellent lecturer and so I feel like I've learned a lot from the course.","Definitely highly recommend this course, especially with Sachdev as an instructor. 143a wasn't such a great experience but 143b more than made up for it. Love the extra topics that we got to at the end like quantum computing.","It's a very good class and Prof. Sachdev is very good at explaining the general idea of what we are doing and why. This class gives you a good understanding of perturbation theory and scattering + some introduction to more advanced stuff like QED, Relativistic QM(dirac eq.), quantum cryptography and path integrals. These last subjects mentioned makes this course worth taking!","Great course, but hard to do well in.","This is a really good class. If you liked 143a then take this class, as you will probably like it even more. You will get to learn some very useful and cool additional quantum mechanics topics like scattering theory, quantum computing, and quantum cryptography. Professor Sachdev is also a very good lecturer and accessible outside of class.","This is an excellent course, basically a requirement for anyone hoping to go to physics grad school, and very well-taught.  Take it if you can.","Great course. REally gained an intuition for quantum mechanics that the formalism of 143a did not provide.","Subir puts a lot of time into this course and it is very well taught. The material is interesting, too."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Sachdev is a solid lecturer, and a kindhearted person. Quantum mechanics is difficult, however, and this course will be rigorous. So be warned.","Physics 143b is an incredible class if you liked 143a and want to build on your understanding of quantum mechanics while learning about cool topics like quantum cryptography and quantum computing.  It's definitely challenging but not too stressful, and you learn a lot without having to put in insane hours outside of class.","Excellent class, excellent prof. Much more fun that 143a, very well taught. Take it; 143a is not complete without it.","Professor Sachdev is one of the best lecturers I have had at Harvard. This class will rarely be dry. Make sure you understand the concepts for exams - they will challenge your undertsanding of basic ideas through slightly tricky situations.","Good class.  Prof. Sachdev is nice and helpful.  He occasionally makes mistakes on the board, so be prepared to go back and fix things\/check formulas for accuracy after class.","This is one of the best courses in the physics department. Prof. Sachdev is a wonderful lecturer and educator who puts a lot of time and effort into helping us learn.","This class can be tough at times, but it is extremely interesting and incredibly worth it to get to know the material well. Also Sachdev is amazing!","This is a fun continuation of 143a that all physics students would be well encouraged to take, particularly when it is taught by Subir.","This course is actually easier than 143a, so don't be intimidated by the higher letter if you already did 143a.","Wonderful teaching and great course","Professor Sachdev was a pretty jolly guy and made the course quite interesting. He is a fair grader and stresses big\/physics ideas rather than small details\/math, which I think is the right direction to go. One complaint I do have is that some of the material in this course was covered in a highly superficial way (e.g. the Hartree-Fock equations). In the absence of good secondary references for some of the topics we covered that are not in Griffiths, it was very hard to feel as if I had really learned anything substantial about the much of more exotic material this course had to offer. Perhaps this could be remedied by using a more comprehensive text?","Professor Sachdev is an excellent lecturer. Through topics such as quantum computing, metals \/ insulators, and the structure of the periodic table, you learn how quantum mechanics appears in the real world. I found this class both less time-consuming and more fun than 143a, I would recommend taking 143a just to get to this class!","Pretty easy class if you can understand Griffiths, which is a great book! Some algebra can get obnoxiously tough considering that most final answers are simple. Notice when integrals are odd!","Excellent professor who can explain quantum mechanics perfectly to a 5 year old. Subir is the boss.","Prof. Sachdev was an excellent teacher, and he was incredibly clear each class. He also introduced some nice applications at the end with quantum information applications. I feel as though 143b is a class that can be great (in the case of Sachdev) or not so great (if some less amazing professors are teaching it).","Fun course dealing with a lot of the applications of the nitty-gritty quantum mechanics of Phys 143a. Prof. Sachdev is a very clear lecturer, and the homeworks and exams are fairly easy.","Very well-taught complement to 143a. I felt that many of the concepts we learned in 143a finally solidified and made sense in context with the material of 143b. Prof. Sachdev is very warm and inviting. I felt like I could ask any questions I needed to in class regardless of whether I thought they were trivial or not. Several lectures towards the end of class in particular left me open-mouthed with awe... quantum teleportation? Cryptography? This material is SO cool! A must for any physics concentrator interested in particle physics."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is an excellent course! Professor Sachdev is a great lecturer and, unlike some other physics professors, takes an interest in his students. You get to see some very cool applications of techniques from 143a. Problem sets and exams aren't terribly difficult. Overall, a relaxed (but rigorous) second course in quantum. I highly recommend it.","This is a difficult but extremely interesting course. If you've taken 143a, definitely take this class, as it goes into many more interesting applications than 143a","This is an excellent class that will give you brief overviews of many different applications of quantum mechanics.  Be aware that the level of material goes significantly beyond Griffiths, especially in the second half of the class.","Lots of cool material, and Sachdev really knows what he's doing.","This class was a nice survey of applications of quantum mechanics. I never took any other class on quantum mechanics, but I'm pretty sure the material in this class is much more interesting than your standard undergraduate QM class. Professor Sachdev was very good at simplifying complicated ideas to make them accessible. The workload and exams were very manageable, and Professor Sachdev's enthusiasm about the subject made the class very enjoyable.","Quantum is awesome! Also, Sachdev is super chill and the tests are nicely all open book\/note.","This was a very fun course that should be taken if you're interested in quantum mechanics. Subir is also a really cool professor.","This class is a lot easier than 143a and with more interesting material. The hardest part of the class is knowing how to apply the things that you learn to the problems on exams.","If Prof. Sachdev is teaching it, it's worth taking. Broad survey of methods and applications of QM based on the second half of Griffiths but not only (we also touched a bit of QED and field quantization). Generally easy and well taught, the assignments and exams are straightforward.","The class talks about the applicable side of quantum mechanics and certainly deepens one's understanding of quantum. Quantum computing (albeit super introductory) is interesting, while other approximation method (WKB for example) can be algebraically nasty, though those were not emphasized as much in the class anyway. Professor Sachdev is a wonderful lecturer and a very nice professor who cares and listens to students' need. If he is teaching it, the take-away is much more than you can get by reading Griffith on your own. He brings in a lot of supplemental material from other source and they are interesting material (QED, Dirac equation, etc)! It is one of few Harvard classes that I truly feel the value of instructor and that I won't learn as much just by studying on my own. It is conceptually hard, but workload wise easy. Pset is fast to finish without really understanding what is going on in lecture, but to fully digest everything in class, it takes a while... So if you want to truly understand the class, you do need to devote enough time.","I think this has been my favorite physics class to date. Those questions you always felt like you should know the answer to as a physics concentrator (why are metals so weird? what happens if I smash some charged particles together? how does entanglement work?) get answered, or at least motivated, in this course. \r\nThe lectures are also more understandable than many intro physics courses I have taken, and at least with Professor Sachdev, the exams are open book, so you feel like you are being tested on your abilities rather than formula memorization. As Feynman said, \"why should I memorize that--I can look it up!\"","This class was excellent; you learn some of the many ways quantum mechanics is actually being applied in various areas of current research, making it much more interesting and tangible than 143a.","Professor Sachdev is a great teacher and a really nice person. Definitely take the class if it's with him!","ok class. very chill. solidifies your knowledge of quantum but a lot of topics seem to be covered superficially. for example one can easily get through most of the problem sets by just doing the math and not really understanding the physics. the problem sets are really easy which is good and bad. honestly i think harder problem sets would make this course much better.","Everyone that took 143a should take this class--it's a natural continuation. However, I don't see the need to take it if you're not a physics concentrator.","This is truly one of the best and most interesting physics classes I've taken here. It's not overwhelmingly difficult and the workload is fair. This allows you to study interesting material related to the course on the side. There are some people who might find aspects of it (some homework questions, the midterm, etc.) too \"trivial,\" but I found them to be just interesting enough to be thought-provoking without having to worry so much about grades. Sachdev is an amazingly clear and slow-moving lecturer and he walks you through a lot of the math, emphasizing the physical meaning. I really enjoyed myself in this class! Take it and have fun!","Sachdev is an incredible teacher and the course gives a good description of many ways in which the quantum theory developed in 143a is applied."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The purpose of this course is a little unclear.  It could be a survey course, exposing students to several applications of quantum mechanics, or it could attempt to teach students in depth about several higher-level topics of quantum mechanics.  Last spring, the course was somewhere in between.  As a result, we were required to understand several topics in considerable depth, though we were not given as much time as should be given to allow students to learn the quantity of material we were expected to know.","If you didn't like 143a for its seemingly formal\/mathematical nature, as I did, then you will love 143b. It's a topics course, and one of the greatest things you'll learn is the dynamics of quantum mechanics. It's no longer about what the possible energies a particle can have. It's more about, what will happen if you fire particles at a hard target, calculating the effects of an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field on an atom, finally constructing chemistry and the periodic table from quantum postulates, learning about what makes bonding work. Finally, you learn the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, assigning much needed meaning and intuition to the subject. With 143b, the physics of quantum mechanics comes alive, leaving the math behind.","Must know material for any physics major, you learn important applications for all of the theory you covered in first semester. Beware of taking this course when Hailu teaches, it although I have a feeling that this year was problematic primarily because it was his first time teaching the class. If you have trouble understanding anything, go to Hailu's office hours; he is much better at explaining things one-on-one.","This class was interesting, both because of the material and the teaching. We covered a very wide variety of quantum-related phyiscs, such as path integrals, many-electron atoms, the WKB approximation, photons and atoms, scattering, and the Dirac equation. Girma is a very enthusiastic teacher, but his explanations in class are not always clear. He shied away from doing many calculations on the board so the math behind the problems was not always explicitly worked out. All of this would've been fine except there was no one textbook for the course so finding material to study from and do the psets with was difficult. You do learn a tremendous amount of physics, but be cautious about the structure of the class.","In retrospect, I learned a lot from this class about some fantastic topics in more advanced quantum mechanics. At the time, I felt like this class ate up my life because problem sets took so long. Simply parsing the psets to figure out what the questions were took forever sometimes. I think Girma can be an effective lecturer and teacher if he has the time to sit down and carefully structure his lectures, but the class often felt very rushed and imprecise as he tried to cut corners.","If you like theoretical physics and lots of math, take this class.","Girma is very enthusiastic and makes the course content very understandable in physical terms rather than just mathematically.","This was by far the most difficult of the classes that I took this semester.  Most of the difficulties, unfortunately, seemed completely extrinsic to the actual subject matter.  Girma Hailu's lectures were disorganized and frenetically paced and explained new mathematical abstractions only cursorily, making comprehension almost impossible; problem sets routinely required nearly twenty hours per week, much of it devoted to puzzling out how to begin work on the problem, as well as a knowledge of material taught in 100-level classes that are not listed as prerequisites; the readings ranged from wonderfully pellucid to nigh impenetrable (or, for the final topic, nonexistent), and given the disorganized messes that our lecture notes became, the readings were the only reliable sources of information.  This was Hailu's first time teaching 143b, so the course may improve if he teaches it again, but still enroll with caution and realize it may become less a course than a very painful version of guided self-study.","This course covers a lot of material, including path integrals and Dirac equation, which sometimes aren't covered in such courses.","One must be prepared for the Girma Hailu experience.","This seems to be the first year a new professor was teaching it--hopefully all the problems you see from other comments will be resolved.","Don't take this course if Girma Hailu is teaching it."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["You will need a lot of time and be willing to deal with frustration.","A great class that develops the applications of 143a. My favorite topic was time-dependent perturbation theory; it's interesting to think about how quantum systems evolve in time. Path integrals, identical particles, and WKB were also really interesting. My least favorite topic was scattering. The introduction to relativistic quantum mechanics at the end is very brief and I'm not sure if I actually learned anything, but it's cool to see the very beginnings of QFT.","This class is pretty good. Some of the topics can be pretty interesting, giving you insight into how things like semiconductors and Bose-Einstein condensation work. Other topics mainly include different approximation techniques, and so aren't as interesting. But all these topics, although involving some complex math, are presented in lecture in a very straightforward way that's easy to process. Because of this, as long as you attend and take notes in lecture, the problem sets and exams are usually pretty manageable. But lecture notes can be really important, because the course doesn't really follow a particular book or anything. Overall, this course is worthwhile; it isn't too much work, and it introduces you to some interesting advanced quantum mechanics topics that will be useful to know for any further advanced physics study.","This class is much much much better than 143a. You finally get to learn some pretty neat applications for the stuff you've been learning. It's still tough, but the teaching staff was really helpful and always willing to help out, even outside of office hours.","This course is a natural extension of 143a and should be taken by any physics concentrator unless you have good reason not to. If you felt 143a was more math and not enough physics, then this class will give you the physics.","You get to see a lot of \"real-world\" applications of the quantum formalism you develop in 143a and a few nice approximation tools along the way, which helps to build your general intuition (and appreciation!) for QM. However, while Professor Hailu is extremely energetic (he is a hep-th after all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and highly entertaining during lecture, he is 99.99% incomprehensible (trust me, I've measured), so yeah, just read the books\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he's a great guy to talk to during office hours though! He's still mostly incomprehensible, but he puts the physics first and the math second, which more than compensates.","This class is the first class in the \"standard\" track that in many ways is not necessary, but rather a series of interesting topics in QM. That said, some of the topics are amazing. Take this class if you have interest in going to graduate school, but if you felt shaky in 143a, then I might recommend putting this class off. In general, don't take classes with Girma, as he has an amazing amount of passion for physics but is confounding in his presentation of topics.","Take this class! Quantum mechanics is always amazing and Dr. Hailu is a great instructor who is very enthusiastic both about teaching in general and the content of the course in particular.","We looked at some really fascinating problems. Some of the math on problem sets was tedious, but overall they were interesting. Exam problems were hit-or-miss, in terms of how they related to the material from lecture.","You will learn useful topics of quantum mechanics, and it is quite helpful for research ( reading publications, journal papers)","The material covered is fantastic, and can make sense in office hours.  Lectures can be difficult to understand occasionally.","The class was all over the place, and so was lecture.","This course had a lot of interesting topics, and I think it's important for a physicist to have seen most of those topics. It covers a lot of useful approximation methods.\nYou should make sure to read Griffiths' QM book even if it's not assigned, it's quite good and very useful.\nIf Prof. Hailu is teaching the course, definitely go to his office hours. They are excellent and though I struggled to follow his lectures he was incredibly clear in office hours and when I went I felt I developed a good intuition for what was going on."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"17","response rate":"88.24","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 143b","course_id":"4105","cat_num":"0253","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 143b","course_id":"4105","cat_num":"0253","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"11","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 143b","course_id":"4105","cat_num":"0253","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"4"}},"success":true}
