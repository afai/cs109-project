The topics are mostly questions of history, pure speculation where empirical evidence isn't an option, and arcane philosophical topics (e.g. if someone's beliefs about causality alter his preferences, do the beliefs need to be right in order for him or her to be rational) so you're probably not going to find questions that economists (you?) consider important and tractable.","This is a great class with two amazing professors. Just listening to them talk about anything and everything is an enlightening experience. The readings are a bit random sometimes, but I enjoyed doing them. This is a really fun class!","Not for unqualified students; otherwise, an excellent discussion."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course is a great introduction the the history and political roots of economics. And it brings an economist (Professor Friedman) and a political theorist (Professor Tuck) into the same room, which leads to really interesting discussions\/lectures.","Professors Friedman and Tuck really know the material well and bring in excellent speakers.","Invest time in doing all the readings each week even if it seems heavy, very worthwhile to get the best out of each meeting.","Take it if you're interested in the material.","Tuck and Friedman are first-rate scholars and teachers and the course is worth taking just to engage them."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2080","course_id":"1028","cat_num":"6576","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2080","course_id":"1028","cat_num":"6576","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2080","course_id":"1028","cat_num":"6576","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
