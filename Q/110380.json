I heard so many horror stories about Expos prior to taking it (as I'm sure you will too), but I am so glad that I ended up in this one because it was great. David is a wonderful preceptor and really takes the time to talk to you and make sure that you are improving over the term. The readings and the course material are really interesting (I mean, you get to read Alice in Wonderland or Harry Potter for homework!), and it is a very laid-back, good class. I would definitely recommend - the best and most painless way to do Expos!","If you love literature, this class is amazing. It allowed me to approach texts from such different angles. Students could look at them from the perspective of \"what about culture shaped this text\" or from the perspective of \"what does this text say about culture.\" David's feedback was excellent, and I definitely improved as a writer. His enthusiasm in class also made the materials that much more worthwhile. If you this course, you will definitely leave it a better writer, a better thinker, and very knowledgeable of children's literature and what it says about our world.","This expos class had great content that made it more enjoyable than others. However, make sure that you come in with specific questions during the meetings after papers.","If you love children's literature, this is definitely the class for you!","This was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard so far. The material is fascinating, Dr. Barber is extremely helpful and very relaxed as an expos preceptor. Plus, he is extremely knowledgeable and will guide your writing to be actually better, rather than mechanical and bound by expos guidelines. From what comparing with peers, this expos class seems more enjoyable than all the rest I've heard about. Anyone who takes this class will have a wonderful time in it.","The material for this expos was actually quite engaging and interesting. Although sections were a bit disorganized, David gave excellent feedback and was great one-on-one. If you liked reading as a kid, take this expos.","If you're looking for a fun, rewarding Expos experience, this is definitely the class for you. Barber, while not a particularly effective section leader, is certainly passionate about the material and is excellent at guiding students through the paper-writing process. The flexibility in paper topics (people in my class wrote about all manner of children's literature, from fairy tales to Harry Potter to Seuss to Oscar Wilde to Winnie-the-Pooh) makes this course a much more interesting and engaging course than other Expos courses, and the lack of a required outline made the course much less tedious than it could have been. When I found out Expos was required, I dreaded having to take what seemed to be the equivalent of another high school English course. However, Wizards and Wild Things has become one of my 3 favorite classes of freshman year. Definitely rank this course first of the Expos classes.","Since Expos is mandatory, this is definitely the one to pick. The readings are super manageable and DB is very laid back and understanding about extensions. He is very willing to talk about your essays and give feedback. I would venture a guess that this is one of the best Expos choices.","David is fantastic - super sweet, very intelligent, and always willing to help. Wizards and Wild Things is phenomenal compared to other Expos courses. \r\n\r\nThe workload is heavier at the beginning of each unit (~80 pages a week), but it is relatively light the rest of the time. Definitely manageable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"15","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.250","course_id":"11500","cat_num":"28327","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.250","course_id":"11500","cat_num":"28327","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"11","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.250","course_id":"11500","cat_num":"28327","1s":"4","2s":"8","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
