Professor Eckert is an outstanding, informative, and entertaining lecturer.","Don't take it if you don't speak Korean.","Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in Korea (either or both of them)!","Definitely take this course! It's really great and not an overwhelming amount of work! It's thought provoking and provides a great insight into the history of Korea and now North Korea.","A strong affinity for Korean politics or culture seems important for this course to be an enjoyable experience.","TAKE IT!!! Never mind the fact that the coursepack is expensive or that you have to buy a lot of books, this class is one of the most exciting that I have taken my entire time at Harvard! This class has one of the most caring Professors you'll ever meet as well as some of the friendliest, most accessible TFs and really goes above and beyond as a class by putting together events outside of the classrooms such as movie nights or a delicious Korean meal at the end! It is rare that you will ever find a class this large with a Professor who still cares to get to know all his students and even rarer to find a class in which all of the TF's are willing to help students out across the board. I really can't say enough in words why this class is awesome, so at least go out and shop it!","This class was fun and very informative! You learn a lot about modern Korean history, which has many lessons for our world in general. I loved this class!","If you are interested in Korea and want to learn a lot about it that take this course. Otherwise, might be a bit of a burden","The course was a bit time consuming as far as readings go, but Korea's History is quite unique and a lot of material is covered.","Make sure to do the readings for the subsequent week's lecture ahead of time!","Take it. It's a lot of fun. Professor Eckert is a great lecturer and always has handouts, which is pretty sweet. The TFs are chill.","This is a great way to fulfill a GenEd and learn about a fascinating part of the world!","This was a fascinating class, not just because I have a personal background with Korea, but also because the course itself was great. Dr.Eckert is a leading scholar in Korean history, and he is also an engaging lecturer. His course material was thorough and the discussions we had in sections were fascinating. Plus, the workload wasn't that heavy, aside from studying for the midterm and the final research project. I definitely recommend you to take this class!","If you are someone who's interested in Korean history, culture, or politics, then I would recommend this class with enthusiasm. Having said that, it's helpful to have some prior knowledge\/interest, or know Korean language, especially when it comes to researching for your final project.","Very interesting class! Wonderful professor and TFs.","If you want to understand current events in Korea, this course would equip you with all the necessary background.","Professor Eckert used to be a handsome actor =P","It was actually more engaging an interesting than I expected, and a good way to fulfill a core or to learn more about Korea.","If you are Korean but never had the chance to learn about Korea's modern history, take it! Even if you are not Korean, it's very helpful. Korea is on the news very frequently these days, and it is very useful to know the historical context behind the current events in Korea.","This class can be fun, but there are lots of other similar classes that are far less work-intensive. Take one of those instead!","Take it if you want to learn something about contemporary Korean history in a relatively stress-free setting.  The final research paper does take up 40% of your grade, but you can write about anything that interests you, so it's very flexible, and there is no exam!  Professor Eckert is a really great lecturer and the TFs are all pretty invested in the course.","not very work intensive. its nice that there is one exam, but the response papers are tough sometimes. its also hard to figure out how your grade is determined..","Professor Eckert tries and actually succeeds in remembering most of the students' names. During class he is an excellent lecturer; outside the class he is always available for questions and is in fact a very funny guy. The materials are eye-opening. You will learn a lot of very interesting things about Korea that can be applicable to other East Asian studies.","It was challenging for me as a student with almost no background in Korea compared to others who spoke Korean or had lived in Korea, etc. The readings are extensive, but interesting. If you're into East Asia, History, or Korean stuff, I'd recommend this class. Don't expect to sail through if you're from Korea or speak Korean though.","The course gave me a new appreciation for Korean history and desire to learn more. It is particularly relevant for the current events of today.","The class was so incredible and really makes you truly appreciate Korean history. Professor Eckert is so awesome and such an interesting person to talk to during office hours. This class was maybe my favorite class this semester.","This class gives you a great survey of one of the most fascinating national histories in the world. It prepares you well for full understanding of modern day Korea and Korea in the news. Prof. Eckert is awesome and you will never feel bored."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I think if you have any slight interest in Korea or its history, you should take this course. The workload is not too bad (weekly response paper and the readings are maybe ~40-70 pages per week, but the readings are interesting and add to what you learn in the course). The lectures are also very interesting. This class also had some fun activities like the movie screenings and speakers and I thought this class, was an all-around great class. I totally recommend it for an elective or a gen-ed. Plus, it doesn't have a final! The midterm also wasn't too bad as long as you were on top of your stuff. There are a lot of names and new information (especially if you don't know much about Korean history), but the teaching staff tries to help you and as long as you review the material and enjoy the class, I think you can do well. Overall, I got a big return on this class, gaining a lot of insight on Korea without being too stressed out in the class. The final paper is also not that bad (3,000-4,000 words), I think, especially if you pick a topic you would enjoy researching.","A very interesting take on Korean history.  Take it; it is neither too time consuming nor too specialized (you don't have to be an east asian studies concentrator to do well).","Professor Eckert is a good lecturer and a great person to talk to. He really shows his commitment to his students, when he visits the sections about twice or thrice a semester. There is no final exam in the course, however a fairly time consuming, yet very open ended, final project. Be sure to keep the final project in mind, because it can jump on you as the class winds down. The weekly section papers were not very stressful, and usually were interesting. Knowing Korean would help in this class, but it is certainly not a requirement!","Reasonable amount of reading, interesting subject matter, excellent lectures and sections.","This course is very interesting and very good, especially if you are interested in Korean history or East Asian history.  That being said, a knowledge of Korean would be really helpful, and taking this course just to take it is kinda silly, because it's not that much fun if you don't actively like Korea.","Great class, well-organized, and a good cover of recent Korean history. Eckert does a great job of balancing different perspectives of Korean history.","Professor Eckert is one of the best lecturers and since Korea is becoming such a popular country, why not take a course that is engaging and informative? You'll not find a better gen ed..seriously.","A very fun, thorough, and insightful class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe best parts were discussions\/debates in section, which frequently were fierce and invested with emotion, the incredible speakers, and the at-times controversial \"impartiality\" that Prof. Eckert approaches the topic with.  Extremely well-organized and well-run.","Lovely course. Prof. Eckert is amazing, and Nuri is awesome as a TF!","Great overview of Korean history. Lacks a sense of challenge.","Fantastic class with a knowledgable professor, caring TFs, and intriguing material!","Do the readings diligently!","Even if you aren't particularly interested in Korea or history, take this class. I only signed up for this class because I needed the SW gen ed and my roommate was already taking it. By the end, I had learned more than I have in any other class at Harvard. This class is fun, engaging, and exceptionally well-taught. Eckert is an awesome guy, always looking to get to know his students, and is more than willing to have a chat after class about anything. The section leaders are also very personal, and I will probably ask Ilsoo and Eckert for a letter of recommendation at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the material is absolutely fascinating. In South Korea and the US, it is often difficult to find unbiased, in-depth information from the pre-war period. In this class, Eckert and the TFs make sure to examine the people behind such vilified groups as the Ilchinhoe and attempt to humanize North Koreans. There are weekly 500-word response papers that take less than an hour to do, and each one allows you to form some perspective on the topic at hand. The midterm was certainly manageable, assuming you either did the readings or paid attention in lecture, and the final project was flexible and fun (even though I had to pull an all-nighter to do it). This class is everything I'd hoped classes at Harvard would be, and my only regret is that I know that I have already taken the best class at Harvard as a freshman.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: If you like Korea or history, take this class. If you need an SW gen ed, take this class. If you don't like Korea or history, and if you don't need an SW gen ed, take this class.","Quite easy, little workload, but not particularly interesting. If you like your other courses, this class would make a good sidekick, but don't expect to take a ton away from it. (You will learn some Korean history, though, as weekly reading response papers are not optional)","THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. If you're deciding between this class and other SW classes what are you even thinking!?!? Professor Eckert is the absolute MAN and his lectures are phenomenal, in part because he was actually THERE for many of the modern historical events that you discuss in class. The lectures are engaging, the course material is fascinating, what more could you want? Especially if you're interested in Korea or if you're Korean American but don't know any Korean history, this class is a fun introduction to the history post Choson dynasty period. You'll love love love it. There are a lot of readings, but they're so interesting that the work doesn't even feel like too much!","I am not a history person, and I dreaded having to take some sort of GenEd that would fulfill the Studies of the Past requirement. That said, this is a wonderful course, and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Eckert's lectures are funny, interesting, and engaging. He conveys the basic points, which are always backed up in the readings, and also provides interesting anecdotes. The readings can sometimes take a while, but they were so interesting that the time spent reading them was never an issue. I thought this was, simply put, the best history course I've ever taken. I am still not a \"history person,\" but The Two Koreas made me enjoy studying the history of a fascinating, currently evolving topic more than I ever thought I could.","This class is great for anyone with an interest or curiosity in Korean history. Personally, with a background and roots in China and Japan, I tangentially kenw some things, but had never learned much about Korean culture or history. Professor Eckert is such an amazing scholar and lecturer. Not too high stress, but the course gives a really good picture of precursors to current tension in East Asia.","The part where you learn about North Korea is fascinating! The other parts are less fascinating. Prof. Eckert is fantastic, though.","The lectures are mandatory for your participation grade but are interesting if intrigued by the topic.  It works like an interactive history class - and the section leaders are very knowledgeable.","Professor Eckert is outstanding, and his enthusiasm for Korean history is infectious.","This class was definitely the best gen ed I've taken. It had enough work so that I learned a lot, but not too much. I highly recommend this class to anyone, even if you have no personal connection to Korea.","professor eckert is very engaging. i went to every single lecture. you would appreciate taking this course if you want to know more about korea, and how korea became the way it is now. if you are korean yourself, you would also learn more about yourself and be able to situate yourself in the nation's larger historical trajectory.. this can be enlightening.","Professor Eckert is an incredibly enthusiastic and brilliant lecturer, and the TFs are amazing, especially Dima. The class will open you up to so many new ideas and give you an incredible understanding of crucial events in Asian and American history. The workload is very fair, and super interesting. Due to the amount of reading and research, you really get what you put into the class. I gained a ton of knowledge and loved the class, but did not have to go crazy doing tons of work. It was awesome, and I got to meet some incredible people!","If you have ever wanted to learn more about Korean history, if you are interested in current news about North Korea, you have to take this course! It will give you the background and context necessary to understand the complicated political situation. Professor Eckert really cares about his students, wants to get to know them. The readings are interesting and doable. Not too much work, though the research paper at the end of the semester can be stressful if you don't get started early.","In all honesty, I did not expect this course to be my favorite of the semester, or even one I liked at all. And the first few lectures and weeks, I wasn't sure what to think. But then sections started, and I started understanding lectures after doing readings, and I began to really like the class, and actually looking forward to it. Professor Eckert's enthusiasm and friendliness and accessible lectures, Dima's provocative questions, the perfectly poised response paper questions that ensured we did the readings and understood the main points each week. This was a really truly great course, one of my favorites so far, and I can't say enough good things about it. You get what you put into it, and the more effort and time you put in, the more you'll like it. If I could give this course more than five stars, I would.","Class covers Korean history very well and gives you an understanding of the foundation that the situation in north and South Korea was built upon.","TAKE THIS CLASS- It is the best I've taken at Harvard.","Very manageable. It wasn't too time-consuming but I still learned a lot. Go to the film screenings, especially the North Korean comedy- it's hilarious.","This is an extremely well-taught course! You will leave with a solid understanding of Korea's most relevant history and current position.","This is a great Gen Ed to take and you actually learn about Korea.","The lectures and reading selections are truly a joy to experience; if you have even a slight desire to understand the headlines coming out of Korea in recent times, this class will more than sate it. However, your grade and experience will depend heavily on your section and your familiarity with Korea. Beginners will inevitably feel disadvantaged at times-- for instance, while memorizing the names of Korean historical figures for the midterm, or when showing up to a screening that only a fraction of the course participants will attend (some students having already seen the films in question.) It is up to the individual to decide whether the risk to one's grade is worth the high quality of the lectures, guest speakers, and readings.","Great class. I learned so much about the last 100 years of Korean history. The TF's are really knowledgeable, and spur on good discussions in section.","This is a great Gen Ed- easy midterm and then a final paper. You do have to do 1 page papers for section each week with requires bait of work however it keeps you up to date with the material.","Fascinating material and engaging lectures! The workload is not too much (in particular, readings are very manageable as well as interesting) and the grading is very fair. Highly recommend if you're interested in the subject!","Phenomenal class, interesting and relevant material, great teaching staff","It is an awesome course and everyone involved in teaching it has so much enthusiasm for the material.","The professor is extremely well informed and passionate about the subject matter which makes it a pleasure to listen to him. I had a wonderful time learning about Korean History as a student with NO previous knowledge. A great general education class, definitely a gem.","An extremely informative course that is both rewarding and manageable.","Eckhert is an amazing teacher - funny, always in a good mood, charismatic, and informative. The sections were fun, the assignments were not too time consuming. The movies were so cool (one was a North Korean 2000s film) - and there were guest speakers! Loved the course in general.","A very good course with excellent faculty! The readings are long and they are very understanding and it shouldn't be the reason people step back from taking it!","I think Professor Eckert is great, and I definitely recommend this course if you're enthusiastic about Asian\/Korean history. I personally am not, so it wasn't my favorite course, but it really helped me learn more about Korean history and understand today's current events in Korea better."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"90","response rate":"68.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 27","course_id":"2042","cat_num":"0786","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"17","5s":"36"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 27","course_id":"2042","cat_num":"0786","1s":"2","2s":"25","3s":"32","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 27","course_id":"2042","cat_num":"0786","1s":"13","2s":"40","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
