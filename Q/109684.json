The material is fascinating and moves quickly. It's a mixture of qualitative information, but with some mathematical advection-diffusion-etc. modelling that I think surprised some people with its level of difficulty. It isn't the hardest engineering class but you do have to put in work and study for the midterms. The final project is applied and interesting.","It's a fair amount of work and a complex subject. Some of the lectures are dull, but if you pay attention, you will learn a lot, and the course material becomes fascinating that way.","ES163 is a great class to take alongside either ES165 or ES164. It covers topics in both classes and provides numerous ecological applications for those topics.","This is a great class to be introduced to a lot of things water-related.  I'm more interested in the topic now than I was in the beginning of the semester, so I would say that's a success.  \r\n\r\nThe final partnered project was a huge time commitment for a short period of time, but I think that's because we wanted to keep working on it because the topic was so interesting.","This class made me so much more knowledgeable about water engineering and considerations with regard to both fluids and the environment. The information is hard but super practical, and Patrick balances the rigorousness of the material with a relaxed and understanding classroom atmosphere. The weekly homeworks are difficult but not too time consuming, and not having an additional section is a nice bonus.","This class was good and covers an interesting topic.  The class should get better as it advances and grows from its first time being offered.","This class is a QUANTITATIVE approach to the material. It is still a phenomenal class, but it is not a qualitative course, as the title might imply! :)","If you're an environmental engineering concentrator interested in environmental processes and remediation, you should definitely take this course. It filled a big gap in the curriculum, and the course should only improve in its subsequent offerings. Patrick is cool.","good course because of material well organized lots of help","This class is interesting for its own sake, but you'll also learn a lot about models of advection, diffusion, and dispersion that have applications beyond water engineering. That alone makes the course worthwhile for an environmental engineer.","This class is really organized and Patrick is really friendly and teaches clearly. There is a final project in place of a final, which is interesting. Unless you are interested in learning about how pollutants move through different aquatic systems (not removing them), this material might be boring. The psets are doable and the midterms are graded fairly.","Buy the textbook immediately"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Patrick is fantastic. The course is very straightforward, but interesting and fun. It made me want to be an ecological engineer! If you are at all interested in environmental engineering, take the course!","It's a pretty tough course, Patrick basically copies the textbook to the board and you have to write frantically to keep up, but I learned a lot and I came in not really caring about water pollution but by the time we did the final project I was pretty into it. Psets were really hard, I pretty much did an all nighter every week and still did really poorly on them, but when I realized that a) A lot of the problems are almost identical to example problems in the book and b) other kids did poorly on the psets, it felt a lot better. Overall good class, if you are choosing between this or Atmospheric or Soil Chem, I think this is your best bet.","If Hannah is TFing again, be sure to be on-point with everything in your pset.","If you're interested in what pollutants we're worried about, how they move in rivers and lakes, and how to treat them with large systems, this is a good course. However, due to the empirical nature of many of these topics, you'll feel like equations are being thrown left and right at you, especially once you're past the advection-diffusion material. This leads to some frustration with the work (i.e. worrying about small things like units, and plugging and chugging). The ends might justify the means if you enjoy designing (but not building) a more realistic treatment system. Patrick is also wonderful to work with and is very helpful at office hours.","Take only if you're interested in water management"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"6.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 163","course_id":"10732","cat_num":"72571","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 163","course_id":"10732","cat_num":"72571","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 163","course_id":"10732","cat_num":"72571","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
