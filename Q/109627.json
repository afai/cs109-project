However, it was EXTREMELY difficult to understand the topics each week and there was so much reading that it was hard to keep up. This may change next year, but Prof. Strominger did not do a lot of explaining the basics and this made it extremely difficult. If you have a super strong astrophysics background, then take it. Otherwise, it may not be a good option unless you have the time to do all the readings.","I would definitely recommend this course for students wanting to learn more about physics. However, I would let them know that it is naturally a tough course just because the concepts are extremely difficult to grasp. This course was not stressful in any way though. And provided the perfect platform to begin thinking about these larger questions.","Make sure you go to lecture with questions.","This is a great seminar for people who are casually interested in modern\/advanced physics. The workload is really chill (as one would expect for a seminar), but you come away really learning and understanding a lot! And Professor Strominger is fantastic! Both brilliant, and really kind. And any theoretical physicist you might wonder about, he knows, which is really cool!","Great class, the professor is amazing, so many situations unique to Harvard.","This is a great course if you have an interest in physics and want to learn about the current topics of physics.","Professor Strominger is an amazing guy and he knows his stuff... maybe a little too well at times, be prepared to be confused, yet enriched.","If you are interested about the questions that theoretical physics are faced with today, take this. Professor Strominger is great.","BEST COURSE EVER! I could not have asked for a better experience. Professor Strominger is an incredible physicist, and an even greater human being. Going into the class I was unsure of whether I wanted to concentrate in physics, even though I enjoyed it a lot. This class made me sure of that choice. \r\n\r\nHearing Professor Strominger's insights on modern physics was extremely rewarding. He invited us home for dinner every week (which I looked forward to eagerly). We got to meet and have dinner the 2013 Nobel Prize winner, Francois Englert, too!\r\n\r\nEven though I didn't learn of anything in depth (considering this is a freshman seminar and the topics are complex), this course is something I truly cherish. Professor Strominger is definitely my hero!","This class was incredible. First of all, we learned a lot. The readings were extremely interesting, and the discussion flowed smoothly. You can learn a lot whether you consider yourself very knowledgable about modern physics or have never learned anything beyond Newton. The class definitely had representatives from both ends of the spectrum, but nobody dominated discussion. Also, the class is very laid back. It was a no stress environment. You are encouraged to ask questions, but never forced to do so. For the last third of the semester, we had class at professor Strominger's house. Each time he got us a different meal (we had Thai, Chinese, Barbecue, etc.). I looked forward to going to class every week."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you're like I am and want to understand everything about the course you're taking, Freshman Seminar 21v may not be for you. We cover some pretty heavy material, from quantum mechanics to black holes to string theory itself. At first I read the chapters we were assigned in depth, furiously taking notes and attempting to make sense of what I had learned. However, this material frustrates even the greatest minds in science, and that is an important point to keep in mind while navigating this course. Essentially, take Freshman Seminar 21v at face value (as I learned to do). You will read about some history of the field and how it has progressed; you will learn a bit about scientific phenomenon (but not at a fundamental or deep level, simply because concepts become too complex); and you will almost certainly enjoy the Insomnia Cookies at class every week. But if, like me, you want a seminar experience that will force you to think critically about a topic, engage with your peers (and professor) in discussion and\/or debate, and change the way you think about something, Freshman Seminar 21v may not be for you. That said, I did enjoy my time in the course. Professor Strominger is incredibly generous, and Alex (our TF) rocks. Professor Strominger is beyond brilliant, and I would suggest you take advantage and go to Office Hours, to ask about physics or just to chat. Freshman seminars are unbelievable opportunities to get to know world-renowned staff, so don't pass that up!","We like to call this course \"Black Holes and Cookies\" \nBest class ever. You will learn so much and eat so many cookies. It was also really cool when Professor Strominger, we called him Andy, brought us over to his house for discussions and food. Little did we know going into the class how INCREDIBLE Andy is. He was mentioned in all of our readings and is published in some very important research.","There are cookies.","Professor Strominger and the TF Alex are awesome. Definitely take this class.","The best class you will ever take. Seriously. Cookies, food, mind-bending physics and the most amazing professor of all time - there's nothing better.","its a really fun class. you learn a lot about a field that for most of us would be pretty inaccessible","This course is great way to engage with the theoretical physics questions today with one of the great pioneers in the field of string theory!  Every class we were treated to cookies and milk in a very warm discussion based class environment.   If you really want to grapple with equations or lab work, this course is probably not the best, but if you are the kind of person who enjoys specials about the cosmos on the Discovery Channel, this class would be for you!","Andy makes this class.  I love him.  I wish he was my grandpa.","This class is simply the best.  Modern physics is a daunting subject, but this class makes it easy to understand in a qualitative sense.  Professor Strominger and his grad student Alex are some of the best people that you will ever meet.  Some of the reading can be heavy (but not long) but it is ever so worth it.  As a potential physics concentrator, I particularly appreciated this course, but anyone with even the vaguest interest in modern physics will enjoy this course immensely.  Workload is light, with weekly reading and a single paper due at the end of the course.\nAfter taking this course, I fear that no other may be able to match it.  I cannot recommend this course enough.","Take this class. If you are at all interested in cool modern physics (black holes, string theory, etc.), you will love it. Andy is an amazing professor and it is very clear that he loves teaching freshmen and cares very much about his students. We had dinner with him several times throughout the semester, a couple of times at his apartment. We got to meet amazing physicists (including Andy!), and Steven Weinberg (nobel prize laureate) visited with our class when he came to campus for a public lecture. Andy even took the class out to see Interstellar and then dinner in Chinatown. The experience of this class is every bit as amazing as the material covered. I returned from class every Tuesday energized and inspired by the amazing world of physics. I always looked forward to going to this class - it was a highlight of my week. I cannot overstate how great  this class is. It is a wonderful experience for freshman fall, especially to spend time with a professor who cares as much as Andy. This class is the kind of thing that makes Harvard so amazing - take advantage of it!","You learn an immense amount about modern physics, get to meet major figures in the field, and there are cookies!!","This course is mostly consisted of self-reading and Q&A in class. if you are a person who prefers professors teaching and instructing a lot, this course may not be perfect for you. However, the professor is extremely accessible and nice, so if you don't mind lots of readings and like to explore this very awesome topic, feel free to try!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 21v","course_id":"10792","cat_num":"60008","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 21v","course_id":"10792","cat_num":"60008","1s":"4","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 21v","course_id":"10792","cat_num":"60008","1s":"5","2s":"6","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
