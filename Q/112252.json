Professor Jones is great about being available to discuss Aristotle or student work.","This seemed like an ideal introduction to Aristotle. The readings were reasonably-sized, if sometimes skull-cracking. Lectures helped for understanding the material and were often fun. For being about Aristotle, this was relatively painless.","I would encourage future students to do all of the reading for this course. Aristotle can be difficult to read, but his writings are interesting.","Aristotle was a really smart guy.","The advantages of the class are that Jones is a clear thinking lecturer, a kind professor, and an engaging presence. The structure of the class is also productive without being too difficult. However, those who don't already know they enjoy ancient philosophy might find it difficult to see the urgency in Aristotle's work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"2.92","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"17","response rate":"70.59","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 102","course_id":"4046","cat_num":"8100","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 102","course_id":"4046","cat_num":"8100","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 102","course_id":"4046","cat_num":"8100","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
