However, be sure to work intensely on your paper, and know what you are getting into. Do take this course to write a research paper on a subject of interest in Sino-American relations, hesitate to take this course if you are unsure of what you would write about or find interesting within this subject field.","This is not a class that discusses the big picture of US-China relations but rather one that focuses on research methods. The research paper on a specific episode in the history of US-China relations is the key component of this course.","This is a very good, organized, and interesting seminar. Both Professor Manela and Liang were great and engaging. Liang was very helpful with the research paper and the other assignments. It's a great course to do to fulfill the research seminar requirement.","Great way to get practice with research papers.
