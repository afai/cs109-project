Also a very manageable workload. Take this class if you're interested in (evolutionary) neuroscience\/cognitive science.","This class was incredibly interesting.  The format of the class, with the guest speakers, was really great as it gave you a taste of a wide variety of subjects within the broader topic of the evolution of cognition.  However, it being the first year this class ran, there were definitely some bumps that need to be worked out (i.e. very unclear on how our grades were actually being determined, readings were often posted late, very little feedback was given, etc.).  But these will likely be improved on for next year.","Take it if you have an interest in the mind and cognitive abilities of humans, non-human animals, and robots! The course is a great blend of science and philosophy and you will learn something new and incredible every week!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.20","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"50.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MBB 980g","course_id":"11033","cat_num":"59755","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MBB 980g","course_id":"11033","cat_num":"59755","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MBB 980g","course_id":"11033","cat_num":"59755","1s":"4","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
