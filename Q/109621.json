I knew little about Chinese history entering this course, but I came away both with knowledge about events and an understanding of the historical explanations for China's developments. Prof K\u00c3\u00b6ll cares about the students and leads sections herself, and can offer a lot of guidance if you have particular interests.","Professor Koll is an extremely accessible guide on this high-level, fascinating synthesis of modern Chinese history.  The discussions and readings are interesting.  Given what I've heard from friends, I would choose this over SW11, for those debating which course on Chinese history to take.","Really great course! We somehow managed to hit all the big changes that have occurred over the last hundred and twenty years in China, and tied them together by considering some larger narratives. The course deepened my understanding of this period even though I knew quite a lot already about this period in Chinese history. Professor Koll's lectures are easy to follow and interesting; she doesn't post lecture slides though, so it's crucial to attend lectures and take notes","This is one of the best classes that I have taken at Harvard. Prof. Koll's excitement and lecture style makes every lecture wonderful. Make sure to do all of the readings assigned as the section is taught by Prof. Koll, and you will not get as much out of section and the class if you don't do the readings.","Engaging and useful course on 20th century Chinese history. I would say some background in Chinese history\/background is useful though, because there is no real textbook, and most of the readings are primary sources. Prof. Koll is super excited about the topic and is an awesome instructor.","TAKE THIS CLASS! This class was such a joy to take, and I feel like I've actually walked away from this class with both a deep understanding of the material and new perspectives and ways of thinking about history and current international events. This class really has the perfect trio: an enthusiastic and passionate professor who really cares about teaching and her students' educational experience, a classroom vibe that is just really enjoyable and fun, and class material that is just so interesting and relevant. SUCH A GREAT CLASS!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Fantastic introduction to modern Chinese history that helps you gain much more insight and understanding of China today. Professor Koll is a fantastic instructor who consistently gives compelling, entertaining, and interactive lectures.","Great class, Professor Koll is fantastic","You should have:\nEnthusiasm and curiosity about China! Open-mindedness to put yourself in the shoes of the \"other.\" Critical analysis skills which you will further develop and critical synthesis skills which Chen Village and Spider Eaters (primary sources) in particular hone. \nAlso, talk to Professor Koll and Peter are marvelous and you really learn so much from their first hand accounts in those countries.","Professor Koll is an absolutely incredible lecturer, and she generates so much enthusiasm for a topic that might not otherwise be the most exciting. If you have any interest in Chinese history, or just understanding China's current sociopolitical situation, take this class!","I adored this course! If this is offered, take it while you have the chance! Elizabeth Koll is a lovely professor and all of her lectures are both interesting and passionate. This is a real treat to take, and the workload isn't too difficult.","Great class. The lectures and sections are fantastic. I had never studied any part of Chinese history before and I found this class to be really interesting. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.","One of the best courses I have ever taken. Professor Koll is perhaps the most engaging instructor that I have had at Harvard. She is passionate about this subject and is so accessible. Everyone should take a course on China, and this is the one to take.","This was a fantastic class that I thoroughly enjoyed. I came in with no Chinese history knowledge looking to gain some, and this course was great for understanding what happened in China and why they happened. The assignments are great; this class, with a low workload and very interesting topic, was a pleasure to be enrolled in","This course is great if you have a background in chinese history. Otherwise, it can be a struggle to understand all the primary sources. Lectures are fantastic though, and the teaching staff is amazing.","This course is a must if you aren't particularly familiar with Chinese history, because it provides you with great background to understand the position of China in the world today.  Professor Koll and Peter were great.  Though lectures weren't always organized in the clearest fashion, section cleared up the details, and the primary source documents were fascinating.  The grading is very fair, especially for a humanities course, and the assignments were interesting.","A history tutorial of some sort would have helped me a lot. Although I felt that I knew a lot about modern China, lacking a background in historical analysis made the course more difficult for me than I thought it would. That being said, Professor Koll and our TF Peter were very helpful during office hours.","Keep up with readings","This class gives an excellent perspective on the major themes and developments within China during the 20th century. It gives one an excellent foundation for understanding China today. Professor Koll is a fantastic lecturer, and is one of the more engaging and better teachers I've had at Harvard. Take this course.","This is a really fantastic course! Professor Koll is a very engaging lecturer who cares a lot about students in the class. The class really gives you a better understanding of modern China. Readings and writing assignments were fair and Peter did a great job as our TF.","It's a good course on the history of China in the 20th century.","I consider myself somewhat of a Chinese history buff, but before taking this class I knew relatively little about modern Chinese history. Professor Koll is one of the most engaging instructors I have had here and the material was fascinating and informative. There is nothing about this course that would keep me from recommending it.","I came into this course knowing nothing of Chinese history and feeling quite out of my comfort zone. Professor Koll's lectures were wonderful about no presuming prior knowledge without lowering the complexity of the material. The entire course was well thought out and easy to follow. All of the course components--the lectures, the sections, the readings and the assignments--overlapped nicely to create a cohesive picture. The course was challenging, but doable in a large part thanks to the people involved. This is such a solid class.","Truly a great class. Excellent lectures and sections--definitely take if you have any interest in Chinese history."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"31","response rate":"80.65","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1602","course_id":"10933","cat_num":"95731","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"5","5s":"16"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1602","course_id":"10933","cat_num":"95731","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1602","course_id":"10933","cat_num":"95731","1s":"1","2s":"14","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
