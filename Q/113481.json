To really understand the concepts and the readings, and to connect them all together, I found it necessary to sometimes sit down with a stack of blank paper and draw out diagrams of arguments and diagrams of how different arguments connected to each other. Due to the colloquium style of the class, you move through a lot of topics very fast. You should develop a strategy early on to keep them all straight.","This class originally appealed to me because of its interdisciplinary nature. However, class readings and discussion tended to focus on philosophy or law, not the intersection of the two disciplines. Nevertheless, it was a good opportunity to read the newest works in both disciplines and I enjoyed the opportunity to question many of the scholars I read."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 277","course_id":"4073","cat_num":"94967","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 277","course_id":"4073","cat_num":"94967","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 277","course_id":"4073","cat_num":"94967","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
