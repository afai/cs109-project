It is also a relatively fair work-load so is a high return for the amount of time that is required to engage effectively. All of the course staff is fantastic and there is a lot of room for growth.","This course offers a brilliantly creative combination of themes that circumnavigates a profoundly important theme that is otherwise difficult to legitimately handle: human attachment. The anthropological perspective Jackson provides throughout this process is equally unique and effective. This class is unlike no other, and if the theme is of interest it is impossible not to be impacted by the discourse that emerges from the course.","I've been reading Jackson since freshman fall.  As a spring senior, there was no better way to tie together loose intelectual threads and finish up with something rewarding and conclusive."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"89684","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"89684","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1017","course_id":"5040","cat_num":"89684","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
