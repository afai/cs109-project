Its also not too work intensive!","You will learn a lot about the healthcare system you never know, and it's very easy. But it's not really GRIPPING.","Hands down the best class you will take at Harvard.  If you have ANY interest in health care, either from the economic, policy or medical perspective, this class will open your eyes to the problems facing our system today.","This class is probably the best class I've ever taken. It is easy on your schedule, plus the professor and teaching staffs are so nice. Take it whether or not you're interested in health care. You won't regret it.","It's the best class I've taken at Harvard hands down.","This class is awesome, but make sure that you are interested in the quality of health care in america.  It's a pretty narrow topic.","This class is really interesting (especially if you are pre-med or thinking about going into some sort of health-related profession) and you get to hear from some of the leaders in this field. It is also not too difficult with very fair take-home exams (midterm + final). The amount of reading assigned is reasonable (and you can get away with not reading 100% of it). I","Great senior class. You learn a lot without having to put in a ton of work","This is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Harvard.  Taught as a lecture series, this course did not have the typical class stresses associated with it (ex. weekly problem sets, etc.), but was an enjoyable, enlightening, and insightful experience throughout.  I would highly recommend this course for anyone interesting in pursuing a career in health care and medicine.","You can get a lot out of this class if you do all the readings and listen carefully to lectures, prepare for section, etc. You will still learn a lot if you just come to lecture!","This course is truly fabulous, led by teaching staff who are very dedicated. Prof. Slack and his wife are wonderful and really try to get to know students, plus the line-up of lecturers is all-star.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in health policy!","I would definitely recommend this class to anyone considering medical school, but the course can be overly repetitive.","This is a great class with a phenomenal teaching staff.  I truly learned a lot and would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in health care, especially as a possible career choice.","This course addresses an extremely interesting and important topic regarding the current healthcare system. I took the course entirely as an elective and enjoyed it very much. The workload is light and reasonable, and the guest lecturers are worth seeing even outside of a classroom setting. Between the lectures and other assignments, you really get the opportunity to engage with American healthcare.","Great class! Relatively few assignments and low workload, but a great opportunity to meet some of the leaders in the field of health care quality.","Probably the best course I've taken at Harvard. Dr. Slack is a gem, the lectures are interesting, and the work is completely reasonable (I didn't do much reading except in preparation for section, and that's all you need to do). The lectures were from 4:30-6pm on Tu\/Th, which can feel late, but it's completely worth it. Great class.","This course provides the invaluable experience of being able to hear about the largest issues in health care quality from the most distinguished lecturers and experts in their field.","A very good seminar with minimal work requirements. Viewing the health care system through the quality lens will alter your take on the way we deliver care in this country.","This course has inspired me to pursue a career in medicine\/public health and has armed me with information critical to understanding the state of health care in the US and elsewhere."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is one of the best classes I've taken in college, not only because of the well-presented material (and great lecturers), but also because of the sincerity with which the professor cares for the class and the students. If this class is ever offered again, I would definitely recommend that you take the course!!","This is a good class to take for senior spring as the workload is very low until the end of the semester. However, I felt like the material was a bit repetitive and I didn't get that much from the course overall.","This is an amazing class and a terrific learning opportunity - take it, you will not regret it!","Take this class if you have any interest in the subject!","This is a great class to provide a comprehensive view of the US healthcare system. It is taught by wonderful faculty, and the students are all passionate and engaged (because of the lottery).","Dr. Slack is very nice as are the TFs. There were some really nice lecturers and some not so nice ones. But even for the nice ones, it was hard to stay focused the entire time.","easily one of my favorite and one of the best-taught classes at harvard. the teaching staff and guest lecturers were all extremely interesting and inspiring - if anything, this class has inspired me to go back on the medical track as well as consider doing work with healthcare policy.","This was one of my favorite classes at Harvard. Its organization is unique and interesting. The assignments are fair and challenge you to move outside your comfort zone.","Awesome class, painless, a ton of knowledge.","TAKE THIS CLASS","This class is definitely one of the best classes I've taken here. I'm not sure how good it will be in the future because Dr. Slack will not be teaching it anymore.","Awesome class! It's sad that Dr. Slack is leaving though :(","One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard!  The guest speakers can be a hit or miss, but they're pretty much the defining people in whatever they're talking about.  You don't need to go to lecture to do well, but it's be a shame\r\nIf you missed them because they're by and large excellent.","This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. If you are interested in health policy or healthcare in any aspect, consider taking this class (if it's offered next year) -- Dr. Slack is the most caring professor and all of the lecturers had something to contribute to the course. Amazing experience, amazing conversations.","Professor Slack and Mrs. Slack care very much about the class, and it definitely shows in their dedication. I would recommend really getting to know him!","This class if an opportunity to really get to know different aspects of the american healthsystem.  Though some guest speakers were hit or miss, I was very satisfied with the classes.  The class is a very low-stress, fun way to learn about healthcare quality.  I would definitely recommend it.","This is a stress-free easy but extremely useful, important and supportive class. Dr. Slack is one of the most amazing professors you will ever meet on campus. Unfortunately since he will be retiring, I do not know how it will affect the dynamics of the class. However, a different guest speaker is brought in for each lecture and I am sure that the educational component of the class and its overall value will remain the same."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Any student that is part of the American healthcare system, or has to interact with it, should take this course. It is absolutely essential to understanding what is going on with medicine and to make you realize that it is much more complicated than it seems. This course gives you an incredible chance to meet the experts and the \"big cheese\" figures in the field, and to interact one-on-one with them. The professors and the TFs care immensely about the course and the students, and try very hard (and successfully!) make the course feel like a family. I am so thankful to have taken this course!","You will have one of the best learning experiences in this course. It is a very fun course, the teaching staff is extremely nice, and you will be surprised by how much knowledge you gain from the course. This is a must-take course for anyone thinking about becoming involved with healthcare in their future careers.","This course was one of the best that I have taken at Harvard. Dr. Jha and Professor Rosenthal do a great job of engaging the students, and the guest lecturers are amazing! It has a very light workload and is incredibly rewarding; a perfect class to take senior year.","This course is a really good overview of the American health care system and its problems.  The course staff is extraordinarily devoted to the students -- I have never taken a class with professors and TFs who were so concerned about ensuring that the students got the most possible out of the class, and it was really wonderful.  This course also gives you fantastic opportunities to meet personally with some pretty well-known and brilliant people in the field of health policy.","This is a wonderful course, where the TFs are willing to help you piece together the material and work through the complicated mess that modern American healthcare is.","Why force students to work intensely if the information can be effective conveyed otherwise? This class was easy, but I also learned massive amounts about the healthcare system. Had I expended more effort, I would have learned even more. Amazing diversity of experiences; wish I had taken advantage of more of the optional portions.","my favorite course at Harvard","So insightful. If you have any interest in health care, this class is fantastic.","This is easily the BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT HARVARD. All of the faculty put in so much effort to really make this a class FOR US. Having a smaller class filled with people who are enthusiastic about health policy is extremely refreshing because everyone does the work and the TFs aren't out to test little bits of knowledge that we might have forgotten or overlooked, but rather, the assessments encourage us to think more broadly about some of the issues we talk about in class. The TFs are absolutely amazing people who are organized and care so much about their students.  This class will make you a better doctor and patient. Definitely take it if you have any interested in healthcare, health economics, or health policy.","Amazing and enthusiastic instructors! Covers a broad variety of topics in healthcare but will shape the way you view the current system","This is an amazing class if you are lucky enough to win the lottery. It is very low-stress, has a light workload, and you will learn so much about the healthcare system. Though most people don't actually do the readings, they are really interesting and you will get a lot more out of the class if you have time to read.","THIS IS THE BEST CLASS YOU WILL TAKE AT HARVARD DO IT!!!!","This class is incredible. It is everything a Harvard course should be, including engaged teaching staff, fantastic assignments, as well as a great community through coursewide dinners and events.","if you're a pre-med, you should take this course: it brings up questions that won't really be addressed in med school. If you're interested in learning about the US healthcare system in general, this course only really focuses on quality","This course was among the best I have taken at Harvard. The material was so engaging and the guest lecturers are often the #1 experts in their fields. Hearing from the people who helped craft some of the major health care policies in this country is such an amazing experience. The course staff is also incredible. They are so supportive and excited to talk and engage with students. The assignments were interesting and not terribly difficult. The workload really wasn't that bad and most importantly it was all interesting material! Definitely a great class to take!!","Great to course to take if you're interested in learning about all the different aspects to improve the quality of health care. The class though does not teach about the basics of health care so make sure you know that before you take the class. Over the semester, we became really close to each other through the events held outside of class so it's a great way to meet many different professors and professionals in the global health and health policy field. I think it's more beneficial for people who are planning to go to medical school and work in health care after graduation than those who are just looking to learn about health care.","This is a fantastic class.  If you have any interest in healthcare or issues of health policy, this course will introduce you to the most important ideas and also some of the most important people in the field.  Lectures are a huge highlight, with really cool speakers coming in every week (like Atul Gawande!)  The staff is incredibly supportive and lovely, and the class feels like a family.  The Practicum assignment is also AWESOME.  You should definitely take this class, and it's not overly difficult!","It's an amazing class! If you are at all interested in the health care field, this class is a must!","Take this class.","Very interesting class with dedicated staff and lots of interesting speakers. This class helped me better understand the healthcare system and all its complexities. Fairly painless way of learning more about contemporary debates on the healthcare system.","I really enjoyed this class. It got me really interested in health policy and healthcare in the US. We had really great discussions in class that brought insight into problems surrounding healthcare quality. I left the class with an appreciation for the difficulties surrounding healthcare quality and how they can be tackled. I got to know the professors and TFs really well and everyone in the class was really passionate about health policy. Fantastic class!","GHHP 50 was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. As a senior thesis-writer, it was very manageable. The course material is extremely relevant, and it offers a very thorough picture of the current health care system and what needs to be done for effective quality improvement."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It's great for people who want to get a good sense of the general problems in health care system. There are lots of premeds in the class, but fear not the health care system needs to be improved with the help of various disciplines.","This year, the class was filled with pre-med students, who certainly dominated conversations and forced conversations to center around medical knowledge instead of the greater picture. Students like me in the social sciences who have a passion for global health could not always relate. The readings that were studies were not necessarily relevant, but be sure to pay attention in section because that's where you get the better picture. Also, Hummy is the best TF ever!! She is very understanding of the student perspective and is always available for help and advice on life.","This class is great. Not too demanding but you learn a ton! I enjoyed it.","It's a fantastic course that exposes you to the major themes in health care policy. By the end of it, you will feel like you have a solid foundation into the challenges in health care we face in America. I absolutely loved that we had dinners with guest lecturers after class, and the faculty goes out of its way to make the class feel like a family. It's an amazing way to get to know really important people in the field, engage in interesting conversations with other students who are passionate about health care (since it's lotteried, everyone in the class wants to be there), and to further your passion within the field with the final research project.","Take this class if you can get the lottery! You will get to hear the insider view on the quality problems in the U.S. directly from well-known leaders in the field, and you will become very knowledgeable about quality issues in the U.S. healthcare. The course staff is very supportive and super friendly, and there are many opportunities to get to know well not only the teaching staff but also your fellow classmates. You won't regret taking it!","Anyone who is lucky to lottery into this course should take full advantage of the resources, support and all around amazing learning environment to tackle one of the hardest problems of our time.","It's a great class! You have a good chance of getting in as a junior or senior if you are GHHP secondary, and it's a great opportunity to meet students who share the same passions!","Great speakers! You won't find this lecture line-up anywhere else at Harvard, and in the whole country for that matter.","Awesome class! It's a small seminar-style class, which although means that some people will not make the lottery, makes for great discussions. Opens your eyes to the many different approaches people are taking to healthcare quality, from researchers in academia to leaders of hospital systems and more. Great for anyone with an interest in health quality!","Amazing survey of varying topics related to healthcare. The readings are thought-provoking, and the lecturers are rock stars in their fields.","I had very high expectations for this class from previous Q-guide evaluations. The class is great if you are interested in just hearing from guest lecturers every day (the professors only really lecture maybe 3 times over the semester). I thought the class would be more of a community, but I would say that most students don't get to know the professors nor the other students that well. That said, the guest lectures are great, the assignments are fair, and the teaching staff is very nice.","Take this course if you get in! The wealth of information you will be taught alone is reason to take this course. On top of that, you are taught by Prof. Jha and Prof. Rosenthal, two leading experts in healthcare policy with a fantastic lineup of guest lecturers every week. Everyone, whether or not they are going into the healthcare field, will benefit from studying the US healthcare system to this depth.","great class that covers diverse topics","TAKE THIS CLASS! literally the best class i've taken at harvard. it will help you shape your career path or will at least enable you to understand America's absurdly complex health care system. everyone should take this class, it isn't tailored to premed people. it helps people see that there are public health careers beyond being a doctor. it does have a slight \"public health networking\" feel, but that is fantastic if you're interested in the field and regardless everyone should know more about our health care system. \r\n\r\nthe course staff is incredible and so dedicated. ashley is the sweetest and so are the professors. the guest lecturers you will see are unreal. this is a quintessential \"this class could only happen at harvard\". It is also a great senior spring class, especially if you're writing a thesis.","This class is incredible, one of the best that I've taken at Harvard.","This is an amazing course with an amazing and caring teaching staff. You are exposed to a field of health care that most students don't get to experience at the undergraduate level, and it really opens your eyes to the exciting possibilities of quality improvement and health policy. The guest lecturers are all fantastic, but Professor Jha and Rosenthal are by far some of the most engaging and interesting and just overall awesome people to listen to!","Amazing class. Guest lecturers for pretty much every lecture, and they are amazingly relevant and important people who give you really interesting insight. Both professors are awesome.","This course is one of the only ones at Harvard which covers healthcare so extensively. The lectures are a little bit scattered due to the nature of having multiple guest speakers, and the themes can get quite repetitive (systems are important, errors happen, healthcare is complicated), but if you pay attention to the nuances, you can learn a LOT about healthcare. It's also a huge privilege to get to hear many of these people speak, as they are luminaries in their various fields.","This is the ideal class in my opinion - low workload but very intellectually stimulating. You will learn a lot about health policy and the challenges affecting the health care system. Two take home exams make you put the pieces together in a very logical way. Doing the reading week to week is not necessary but will be useful to incorporate in your take home exams.","This is a great course. The teaching staff are wonderful, you learn a fair bit, and its not stressful. Don't turn down the option of taking it if you're lucky enough to be lotteried in!","Lottery into this class as soon as you can and as often as you can so hopefully you can get into it! This class is especially great for people who want to go into health care without going to medical school because we got to see a variety of lecturers who aren't doctors and see the work that they do."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"38","response rate":"86.84","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GHHP 50","course_id":"2145","cat_num":"4832","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"15","5s":"17"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GHHP 50","course_id":"2145","cat_num":"4832","1s":"3","2s":"12","3s":"17","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GHHP 50","course_id":"2145","cat_num":"4832","1s":"14","2s":"16","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
