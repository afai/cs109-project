This is a fairly nascent field so there are still a lot of questions, but that's what makes it interesting! Patrick is a very chill guy, often brings snacks to class, and this is an excellent tutorial.","If the topic sounds interesting, take it! Patrick Mayo is great to learn from. He stresses critical thinking and creates an environment that encourages it.","Seeing Time is a great way to explore your personal interests in perceptual neurobiology. The class allows (in terms of discussions and presentations) for some independence while addressing a really interesting topic. Patrick is really enthusiastic about the subject and clearly cares about his students' interests and questions. This is a nice, small setting to talk about very current methodologies and topics in systems neurobiology."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The course is fun, interesting, and laid back for the most part - however, that doesn't mean it's an easy A. Since the grading is pretty harsh, be sure to be diligent about homework, and not just rush through it in an hour or so.","Very in-depth look at how we perceive time in the brain. Tutorials in general are great for the smaller classroom setting which more readily facilitates discussion, but Patrick also makes the class interesting and slightly more irreverent than expected.","material is somewhat interesting, problem sets are graded rigorously.  It is more time consuming than you may initially think.","i love this class! patrick is so good at creating a very fun learning environment. i'm not really one to participate very often in other sections, but it comes naturally to me in this class. love the subject material too!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Patrick is a great TF who genuinely cares about the class and is always willing to answer questions or  help you when you need it. As long as you put in the effort, you can learn a lot and do well in the class.","Great TF, but assignments tend to be graded a bit strictly.  Be sure to participate in class!","Assigned papers and homework were often challenging, but overall a great experience!","It was a challenging course but Patrick is funny and class times are fun. Patrick is very accessible and replies to emails extremely quickly. Homework assignments make you think hard but Patrick is willing to help you as long as you put in the effort and critical thinking required. This class was a valuable experience for me that helped me think critically like a scientist.","Be prepared for discussions; although class is somewhat laid back, Patrick  expects a lot of you. Otherwise, have a good time and enjoy Patrick's jokes","Seriously the best class I have ever taken at Harvard! Made me totally 100% content with my decision to concentrate in Neurobiology which is something I was pretty wary about beforehand. I love the discussions every week and this is coming from someone who is generally pretty shy in small section-based classes. Patrick is one of the funniest and most interesting teachers I've had so far and he is REALLY good at creating an awesome and fairly laid-back learning environment."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This tutorial demands a little more time and effort than other neuro tutorials (weekly questions aren't easy), and the grading is certainly tougher. However, the subject matter is interesting and Patrick is great guy. This has been my favorite class and I'd highly recommend it.","I could not recommend this class more strongly! Patrick is awesome and the material is really interesting.","Highly engaging class, personal attention, enjoyable class discussions","A really interesting and unique topic in neuroscience. Really makes me think about how I think about time in general and how it is encoded in my brain, as well as how much more there is to be discovered about time in the brain.","Its a good class that has  a minimal workload and laid back atmosphere. Just make sure you read and participate in discussions every week.","If you want to take an interesting neuroscience course, or need to take a neuroscience tutorial, think strongly about taking this course!! P. Mayo is very dedicated to the course, and the material is very interesting -- how does the brain encode time?"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hff","course_id":"3917","cat_num":"72995","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hff","course_id":"3917","cat_num":"72995","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hff","course_id":"3917","cat_num":"72995","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
