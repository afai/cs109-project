Just make sure that you are interested or at least think you are interested in the history of Christianity. This course is exactly as advertised; that is, it's all about Medieval Christianity and does a great job teaching it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.25","workload":"1.62","difficulty":"2.38","recommendation":"4.12","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 1437","course_id":"5069","cat_num":"5997","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1437","course_id":"5069","cat_num":"5997","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 1437","course_id":"5069","cat_num":"5997","1s":"4","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
