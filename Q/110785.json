You don't know what you're missing out on 'til you take it!","Each lecture felt like 30 minutes of material stretched into 53 minutes of teaching. The material is very interesting though and makes you think about something we take for granted: language.","Fun low stress, but very interesting.","This class is fantastic! You will not regret taking it. If you are considering linguistics at all, DO IT!!","Class is interesting, but I don't see any real life application.","Course itself is easy.  Make sure, however, you practice the concepts taught in class.","This class is really fun, easy, and a great intro to a very interesting subject. TAKE IT.","Not exactly engaging, but the subject matter is really cool.","Great course! Make sure the professor stays on top of publishing lecture notes and homework solutions.","This course is incredibly interesting while not overly strenuous (best combination, in my opinion). It forces you to think consciously about a lot of things that you may not have considered before.","Linguistics is the best scientific discipline, and the things you will learn in this class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dphonetics, morphology, syntax, etc.\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare all really, really cool. From my experience, it could be better taught and I wish it moved more quickly, but if you have any interest or curiosity and are looking for a broad-based introduction to linguistics, I would definitely recommend it.","Super easy, and interesting class.  Pass-fail it as a fifth class and you'll get all the fun out of linguistics without doing much work.","This class is a great introduction if you are just looking for an overview of all of linguistics.  If you're coming in with a great deal of knowledge or are looking for in depth study of one or more areas, this is not the course for you.  That being said, this is a great introduction, requiring very little work and stress, and you come out with a basic idea about each of the main branches of linguistics.","Lectures are a bit dry, but the material is really interesting.","This is a great course to take as an elective. It's fairly low-stress and the material is really interesting and presented in a clear way.","This is a good introduction to many of the basic fields in Linguistics.  You will almost certainly like some topics better than others, but each has its highs and lows.  The workload is extremely light and sections are great for mastering the concepts before you start the psets.","Take it if you like learning about languages. This gives a solid background to how languages work.","it's a great senior spring class","It's a fun, light course that will give you an overview of the various branches of linguistic. The workload is very low, so it's a good candidate for an elective. The material is interesting, especially if you haven't had much exposure to theoretical linguistics before.","It's a great overview of linguistics that doesn't require much of your time.","It's a great introduction- even if you do not plan on concentrating in linguistics, it's fascinating in its own right","The course felt really disorganized, but the material is interesting and the p-sets and lectures were helpful and informative."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"24","response rate":"79.17","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LING 101","course_id":"2781","cat_num":"1498","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"8","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LING 101","course_id":"2781","cat_num":"1498","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LING 101","course_id":"2781","cat_num":"1498","1s":"7","2s":"10","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
