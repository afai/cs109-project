'10":{"comments":["This course is amazing, as well as a lot of work.  The class is structured around a group discussion of three papers, per class.  This means that you are exposed to a ton of material, all of which is very timely or fundamentally important to the field.  It also means you will be reading at least six papers a week, but probably more since you often need to read the reviews that go along with that week's topic.  You not only read the material, but get to discuss it with people from a variety of background and perspectives.  This proved to be the best part of the course as you get to see how other very smart people are thinking about the current issues in genetics\/genomics\/-omics in general.  Also, the professors offer their own opinions on the material, including the strengths and weaknesses of the analysis, experimentation and presentation of the results.  All of this will prove quite valuable for anyone interested in a career in -omics research.  This is truly the best course I have taken, ever."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It's an excellent way to become fluent in the language of genomics and understand current research in the subject.","Great class for exposure to the -mics.","you must be willing to read a lot and to think independently.","A great class, but a lot of work"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is a great course to really read the literature in the field of \"big data biology\". I think the people taking the course matter a lot for the dynamics of the course, but if the group feels right, this class is a must.","Very good overview of the genomics field and great discussions.","This is an excellent paper-reading seminar class that will expose you to lots of different fields that end with \"omics\" ... genomics, RNAomics, proteomics, phenomics, .... If you're looking for a programming bioinformatics class, this is not it - but it's a very instructive class that will teach you to present papers, read lots of papers, and write an original proposal. The professors come from three very different backgrounds: TF binding motifs, computational work, and proteomics, so there's a lot to learn from them."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Many topics are mentioned, but you will learn more from reading than from the very brief discussions. Set aside more than 12 hours each week to read and take notes.","This course provides a broad foundation of the 'omics literature. The papers are excellent, and it develops the particular critical thinking skills that are necessary for working in an 'omics-related field.","you will get so sick of reading papers in this class that you will never want to read another paper outside of your field again."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a great literature survey course that brings you up to date on a variety of current methods and research frontiers. Though, take this course only if you're really willing to put in at least 3 hours before every class to really read the papers and be able to discuss. Without that, its hard to benefit from the course.","Prepare to read many articles spanning the \"omics\".","I would definitely recommend this course if you enjoy reading quantitative papers and want to learn more about research in the field of computational biology.","Foundations in wide-range of genomic, bioinformatic, and integrative technology.  Exciting next-generation, state-of-the-art emphasis.  Extremely valuable and supportive faculty-supplemented technical discussions.","This class seems like a lot of work - reading 6+ papers per week -  but was rewarding and really improved my ability to read papers.  It's also a great opportunity to interact with an awesome group of professors who are invested in the material and the class.","The reading list is incredibly useful - when else in your life will you have someone select the 100 most important papers in a given field and tell you to read them?","First, as usual you get out what you put in, and second, be sure you are the target audience for this course! The general idea of a western blot can be grasped quickly, but it is almost impossible to pick up the variety of mathematical techniques relevant to the course on the fly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"14","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOPHYS 205","course_id":"330","cat_num":"6777","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"7","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOPHYS 205","course_id":"330","cat_num":"6777","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOPHYS 205","course_id":"330","cat_num":"6777","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
