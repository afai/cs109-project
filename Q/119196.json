'07":{"comments":["It's not good but its very straight forward.","This course is a lot of work, but it is rewarding and progress is noticeable.","You don't need to be a potential math concentrator to find the material covered in this class very interesting. If you do take this class, I would highly recommend reading the textbook as the course progresses. It really helps to clarify and explain material covered in section.","Study the material closely. The examinations are fiendish--but they also follow the published model tests on the website closely. Those practice exams are a great study aid.","This class covers a great amount of material, and at a very fast pace. Not for the light of heart.","it is a difficult class but doable","By far the worse taught math class I have ever taken.  There is no overlap between what is taught in class, the problem sets, and the exams.","It is not as difficult as a lot of other maths classes out there and it seems o be very useful for a lot of subjects.","It is very difficult but anyone with a background in BC Calculus can do it if they put in the effort.","Along with 21b, a good choice for the last year of math you ever take.","This class is necessary for a lot of things but not enjoyable.","It's extremely difficult for someone who hasn't already taken multivariable calculus.","Take it but know that it'll be hard.","The class is run entirely in section. This may either be good or bad. In some cases, TF's do not adequately prepare for their lectures and as a result you suffer. In others, excellent TF's increase your ability to understand the material. I feel like this course demonstrates the incorrect way to learn mathematics: move too quickly through the material and focus on irrelevant material\/obscure questions. Instead, mathematics should be learned through practice and a progression from easy questions to hard questions. Math 21a jumps straight to the hard questions and doesn't permit students to gather a general understanding of the material.","Class is easier, more interesting, and more useful than math 1a and 1b.  I would recommend the course for anyone who wants to take physics or other sciences at a high level.","This class is very useful but also very difficult if you are not good at math.","Good multivariable calculus course, challenging if no previous experience in multivariable but doable, work in study groups, don't be afraid to ask questions or see TF whenever you need help","It is really helpful to do problem sets and study with a small group.","Understand things clearly in each class + doing practice problems(that means not waiting till the midterms or finals) is necessary to grasp the material and not stress over exams. At the beginning, things start out quite easy and nicely (due to the problems in the book, which are not that many), however, when the material accumulates to a larger amount, it can become quite hard to memorize all.","Unless you love math, don't do it to yourself. I'm kicking myself for taking this course, since now I know I'm not even going to go into the course I thought I had to take this for as a pre-req.","It's a great course for getting a basic foundation in multivariable calculus without having to worry about proofs. You need to spend time thinking about the concepts, but overall the course is interesting and very manageable.","You learn a lot about multi variable calculus.","This class should be taken by those who need to fulfill a concentration requirement or have an interest in gaining knowledge of multivariable calculus.","It is a very challenging course.  Be prepared to put in a lot of effort into understanding complicated material.","Be prepared to have a steady commitment to the class and put in a lot of review on your own time to understand what was covered in class.","The assignments are just busy work, section is boring, but if you find ways to study the material that are fine tuned for you, it can turn out to be a very useful introduction to practical calculus.","This course is highly informative, but it is designed for those with a special interest or background in mathematics.  The workload is fairly heavy and requires a certain amount of consistent diligence in completing the problem sets.  The exams are much easier than the examples covered in class, but it is very difficult to earn a high grade compared to the other students.","It's very self-paced. If you keep up, you should be fine, but if you fall behind just one week, that's 3 lessons you're behind, and the pace is fast.","It's much more reasonable than Applied 21a.","Most students who've taken multivariable calculus do not find this course a breeze.","This is one of those classes where you study and think you know what's going on, but the exam comes as a slap in the face either because you were served a curve ball, and because what you waste your time on (homework problems) didn't help at all.","This is a good math class with understandable material and applications.","This course is a very good class for those who want\/need to learn multivariable calculus but do not like theoretical mathematics.","It sucks but you gotta do it.","I feel the topics in this course are extremely useful to any science major. However, the method of teaching and the structure and purpose of the exams were not effective in conveying the subject of this course.","A good way to learn multivariable calculus that you can use in other fields; no worries about proofs here","independent study would be equally, if not more, effective","Though this class has the potential to be very good, the problems with testing and with a lack of depth in in-class lessons makes success very difficult to attain.  It is unfair that some students who have taken multivariable calculus in high school and students who have dropped down from Math 23\/Math 25 are allowed to take this course.  The Math Dept. should not allow this.  Take this course only if you really enjoy math, and if you are willing to work very hard.","extremely difficult. hours put into studying\/preparing for exams does not correspond directly to exam scores","Good for students going into any of the sciences.  Very applied and un-theoretical.","Unless you're feeling masochistic, you shouldn't take this course. If you're interested in math, you should consider taking a higher level math course. If you're not interested in math, well, let's just say it's like going to Cocytus and never returning.","You definitely have to work with other people on the problem sets, and take advantage of office hours and review sessions that your CA sets up!","take 23, you'll learn more and might be easier to get a better grade","Make sure you get Oliver Knill as your section leader at whatever cost, it'll be worth it.","Very hard. You basically have to teach yourself the material.","take it seriously","If you can do calculations quickly, take this class.  If you cannot do calculations quickly but can understand complex and broad mathematical concepts, this class will frustrate you, and 23 or 25 may be easier.","The material in the course is very interesting and is essential for virtually anyone considering a quantitative concentration. The course is not all that exciting or memorable, but you will learn a lot and it is necessary for many higher level courses.","Definitely a good course to take, but lots of work and pretty difficult material.","The stuff you learn is AWESOME and COOL! And Oliver Knill's review sessions are just one of those things you have to experience.","One should take this class if one wants a challenge and really likes math.","This class is a staple if you want to go into any kind of field that uses any math at all.","This class is good for students who will be using multivariable in later courses.  Economics majors that are thinking about taking this course for 1011a\/b series should be warned that only the first 1\/2 of the course is relevant for future ec classes.","If you don't understand your TF on the first day, switch teachers immediately, because you will most likely understand another one with no effort.  (in other words, not understanding what your TF is saying is actually not your fault.)","Great course, but so much depends on the instructor, try different ones.","Make sure you get a good TF!","Beware of the difficulty if you are not a math person.","I would tell future students that you should know what you're signing up for.  This is a math that's not for everyone, the make-you or break-you math after years of believing that you had a talent in math.  This is the class that separates math concentrators from everyone else.","Be prepared to work.","one should take if they have a strong interest in mathematics and want to see if they want to go on in math","Keep up with the course work.  The class is back loaded such that all of the hardest mterial is covered in the final month.","fast-paced, not too easy, homework gets harder as semester progresses","Wonderful course that made me love math.","It's hard.  It will only really  be a significant time drain at the end, but it's not fun at all.  Don't take it unless you 1) really love math and are very good at it or 2) have to take it for a premed\/concentration requirement.","This class will be very rewarding if you take the time to do all the homework to your fullest capabilities.","math isn't fun.  only take it if you have to.\r\n\r\nmath 21a isn't fun.  only take it if you want to take a course it is a prereq for.  there really isn't much a tf can do to make math fun.  but jay really tried.  props to him.","This class is taught extremely well with sufficient, but not too much work outside of class.","This course is hard (for people not very interested in math). However, you do learn a lot of mathematical approaches to the world. That being said, if you're not interested in science or engineering, this course is not very applicable to your future studies.","You have to put a lot of work in, and there are a lot of subjects covered in a short amount of time. But, the great thing is that your success is proportional to the amount of work you put in, so it is possible for anyone to succeed in this class as long as you pay attention and review the textbook.","Only take it if you need to - it's a constant workload and feels like a high school math class in that you hand in homework every section.","If you want to have a solid understanding of multivariable calculus, I would highly recommend this course.  It covers a lot of material and students come away with a strong background in mathematics.  It is not the most exciting or interactive class, but it is extremely useful if you are planning on going into the sciences.","It's very difficult but you learn a lot. Take it only to fulfill the requirement.","If you are going to take this course, keep in mind that this course will take a large portion of your time so don't take too many hard classes with this course.","Only take it if you are willing and able to put the time into it that it deserves.","You'll have work to do. Even if you've always been good at math, you may struggle in this course.","This class really brings people together...to solve math problems.","Recommended to students who are very interested in math. seriously think about it - don't just end up in math 21a on some drunk whim","Do not underestimate the final.","You have to put personal effort.","try to get chen-yu for TF","Good introductory class for calculus, but inconsistent in terms of work.","It's a good class on multivariable calculus.","watch out. you'd better get chen-yu chi. then life will be good.","Take the necessary amount of time to REALLY know the material.","Math 21a is simply a requirement for many people and unfortunately it's not enjoyable for most. Use the practice tests!","That's it's a very useful course and that I could already see some really relevant applicants, but that it does take a fair amount of work, may not necessarily in terms of time commitment per week (although exam studying does take a long time), but a lot of effort\/focus in order to do well. The student must really love the subject and be willing to work hard in the course. Otherwise, the course isn't a good fit.","Since there are many different math classes offered here, the key to selecting an appropriate math class is knowing what you want out of the class. I wanted a standard multivariable calculus class that had purely mathematical applications and no proofs, a class that would intrigue and challenge me but not consume all of my time and push me over the limit. This class did a fairly decent good in filling those criteria.","It is an interesting course but it requires lots of focus, effort and time.","Math 21a is well taught, surprisingly coherent for a class taught entirely in section, and surprisingly fun.","If you need to learn math beyond AP Calc BC and are not majoring in math, this is the course you ought to take. i.e. if you're doing science, engienering, economics, etc.","Try to get Oliver Knill as you section leader!","I would only recommend this course to students who are willing to put in a lot of work and who love math. The concepts are more abstract than single variable calculus and at times it was hard to see the practicality of the course. It was very challenging.","dont take it","While this class covers interesting material, it can be quite difficult. If this class is not required for a concentration, there is really no reason to suffer through it.","This class is almost entirely what you make of it. If you can put in the time and effort to go over every problem carefully enough to get it right, you will be fine, but if you do not have that time then it will be harder.","Don't skip class like I did.","This is a great course in multivariable calculus that was challenging but rewarding.  It teaches the material very well and in a practical way that is both memorable and useful.","Demanding","Take only if your concentration requires it","If you are taking this as a science concentrator, take 19a instead.","Math 21a as a Multivariable Calculus class at Harvard will be unlike those at other colleges.  The course is tough: the homework and the exams.  Prepare to work in this class.","It's ok but you should expect to do most of the learning on your own.","It's hard.","Teaches what you need to know and leaves out the useless stuff.","Make sure you like math.","If you need to take a more advanced Calculus course, this is definitely the easiest one.","It's a good, straightforward math course - it starts easy and gets intense near the end.  If you keep up with your homework and study for finals you should be fine.","Be prepared to spend time learning the concepts, which can be difficult to understand but are essential to the overall course","21a often feels overwhelming but at the end of the semester you feel like you solidly know multivariable and vector calculus.","It is very hard, be prepared.","Make sure you are prepared to handle a college work load.  If you're an incoming freshman, you may want to wait before taking this course so that you can adjust to the college lifestyle.  It's tricky when you want to enjoy all that is great about college but have to keep up with a very fast moving course.","I was debating which class to take from levels 21 to 25. I decided on 21 because even though 25 was extremely interesting and engaging, in the end, it was an extremely heavy workload, and 23 is neither as fundamental as 25 nor as applicable as 21. Maybe I was a bit of a slacker, but I'd rather feel good about finishing and acing a 21 problem set than struggling for ten hours on a 25 set and feeling like an idiot.","Take it if you need it to fulfil concentration requirement, and it would help to have some background in physics","Unless you love math, don't just take this class \"for fun.\" It isn't extremely difficult, but it does require a fair amount of effort. Also, Professor Oliver Knill, the course head, frequently makes small errors (computational,etc.) , especially on practice exams and during practice sessions. Students should be aware that being in Prof. Knill's section is not necessarily better and that his computations should be looked at with a critical eye. On practice tests especially, Knill tends to make errors on answers, and students often question whether it was they who made the mistake or Knill who make the mistake. Knill is an entertaining speaker and he draws interesting questions into the class, but his review sessions are often confusing and full of minor, distracting mistakes.","If you are willing to work hard, and are good at math, but not intersted enough to concentrate in it, then this class is probably a good choice for you.","Difficult but necessary course for introduction into higher level mathetmatics","If you're gonna never go to class, at least cram for the exams a little bit earlier than 24 hours","A great class for those who want to learn math that is directly relevant and applicable to fields outside theoretical math or mathematical science, providing an in-depth approach without turning into a \"higher-math\" ordeal.","This course is good, but be careful who your section leader is and what time you take the class.  Be ready for the difficult homework that is assigned every day.","Take this course only if you have to meet a requirement.","very difficult class but satisfying once you understand the concepts. that phase may not occur for several weeks after the material is taught however.","hard, not taught well","It's application based multivariable; extremely useful and applicable to other fields such as physics\/chemistry.","it will greatly improve upon your knowledge of basic calculus and is essential to anyone considering a math-related field","Multivariable calculus will blow your mind.","The first midterm will seem pretty easy because it is about all the stuff that you already knew, but don't get too comfortable because the second midterm and the final are much more challenging.","pursue this course if you have a sound mathematical background, and really want to further your conceptual knowledge","A very useful course that enables you to advance your calculus knowledge.","Take it if you need it and don't hate math; otherwise it's not worth it.","It's a great course but it's very difficult and requires a lot of time every week.","Definitely try to find a good TF early on, one that you can learn from well and approach easily.","Keep up with the homework!!

This course provides the necessary background.","If you put in the time to practice the material from lecture and put in a good effort on the problem sets, this course will provide you with a good foundation for multivariable calculus.","I think that it didn't do a good job of informing us of what concepts were important to know.  We were not well prepared for tests.  Course relied too heavily on the MQC.","ONLY take this course if you have a strong interest in the material (ie. for graduate school, concentration, thesis etc).  Also, ONLY take this course if you have been taking calculus-based math in the previous semester.  This course should NOT be taken if you have had more than a few semesters away from calculus-based mathematics.","It is not too bad if you pay attention in lecture and try to keep up with the homework.","Interest in math; good knowledge of calc.","It's not that much fun but you might as well learn it. I think it gives you a solid background for some other courses. Also, the workload isn't as bad as it could be and is manageable.","It can be very difficult and the material you learn is not easy, but take advantage of the mqc, office hours, and other friends in the class to make sure you're not left behind as the semester progresses and the material gets even harder.","It is difficult but interesting.","Take this course only if you need to, and take this if you can't stand Math 19a, like I did, when you shopped it.

I don't know why. Don't slam it in the CUEs if you're just doing badly. I'm not doing well, but I still think it's a good class.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's all about being willing to do more work outside of the homework assigned. A lot of people would feel like they were dumb if they had to do extra problems on the side or go to section when their friends didn't, or use MQC. If you feel like that and let it hinder your actions, you will do badly in the course. Of course, some people are very good at math to begin with and won't need these suggestions. \r\n\r\nStrangely enough, also be wary of asking too many questions. It's easy to get confused and think you'll just go to MQC if you don't understand something. That's how half-understanding accumulates until you hit test-time and realize you don't really understand your fundamentals.","Easy class if you have solid knowledge of single variable calculus","Important to use textbook to fully understand topics","It's not like you have a ton of choices...Try to take it when Knill is teaching, he seems to do a better job than Judson.","The material is really difficult and if you don not have the right TF then you will do poorly.","It's hard, but it's interesting. You get to deal with things in 3D and with motion.","That the course is set-up well, and help is given on a daily basis with the MQC.","If you are deciding to between this class and Math 1b, I would recommend taking this class.","It's an easy class and you can get an A if you put in a little time, but if you really want to learn the material you are going to have to do a lot of extra work that is not assigned.","If you're comfortable with single-variable calculus and don't mind learning things in a core class, this is a relatively painless way to fulfill a core requirement.","Take your time to really understand the underlying mechanics of the course, it makes the midterms and exam much easier and intuitive."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You will learn a lot, but it is hard to keep up sometimes.","21a is a difficult class.

If you're at all interested in maths you'll at least find it engaging and hopefully somewhat relevant to what you're taking. One note though: as someone who had not taken Calc BC in high school, but whose AB class had covered some of the material in Math 1b, I deeply regret not taking this course over Math 1b. If the thought occurs to you to skip 1b based on the material you already know (or based on the placement exam), you probably should.","You should know what to expect from this math class.  3 psets per week, but if you do the work and are prepared to put in the time for the psets, you should be just fine.","A week-to-week grind.","This course is extremely well organized, and it presents a large amount of very useful material in a clear fashion.

As long as you stay ahead of the work, find a problem set group to work on assignments with, and attend office hours if you're feeling lost, you should be golden.","Math 21a strikes a perfect balance between challenging and easy. In terms of workload, it is certainly demanding in that there is no leeway for you to fall behind (so it teaches you time management), but if you're able to stay on top of the work, the course is not frustratingly difficult and can actually be enjoyable. :]","Be prepared to put in a lot of work on your own to understand the concepts.","This class is very interesting if you're into math, but it's difficult.

My semester overall would have been a lot happier and so much more successful had I taken another class. I got lower grades in my other classes than I could have had I not taken this class because I was so worn down (physically and emotionally) by this class.
