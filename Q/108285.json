A good starting point for students who have some knowledge in political philosophy and want to take it further.","This class is only for people really interested in political theory, but if so, it is a very enjoyable class.","I really enjoyed this class.  It is fairly self-motivated and I'm still not sure how the grading works, but I enjoyed the subject materials and the discussions.","Professor Rosen is extremely knowledgeable. Be prepared to follow your own interests, as much of the content of the course is structured by the students themselves, which is really cool.","This is essentially a tiny lecture course with very little back-and-forth discussion between students. The professor focused more on providing his own commentary than on facilitating the development of students' own arguments and perspectives. I feel I would've learned as much doing the reading on my own; the class discussions were not proper discussions at all, and so I found them frustrating and inconclusive. If you have an exceptionally strong interest in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy, you may enjoy this course, but I doubt otherwise.","This is a great class if you're interested in political philosophy. Michael Rosen is an incredibly bright and engaging Professor who seems genuinely interested in the opinions and ideas of his students. The small class size makes for exciting discussion and Professor Rosen allowed the class to determine the syllabus for half of the semester, making it possible for us to explore our individual interests with the rest of the class. If you're a theory nerd and you're looking for a good recent political philosophy class, take this class!","If you like more modern political theory\/philosophy, this is a great course. But be prepared to put in a lot of time on the readings\/presentations, and write a long final paper (philosophy papers are denser than they may seem!). The chance to work with Michael Rosen, though, is not one you should pass up lightly if you are interested in the topic. He is fantastic as a professor and leads a great course.","This was an amazing class - I could not recommend it more"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The opportunity to learn from Professor Rosen is special, but take advantage of his time outside the classroom to increase the opportunity for feedback on your individual thoughts.","This course was perfect for juniors thinking about theses. It not only provided a strong core grounding in recent analytic political theory, but also helped us to develop the skills required to contribute meaningfully to highly philosophical discussions. I hugely appreciated how the course became more malleable as it progressed, allowing the students to pick their own topics and readings. It was the quintessential political theory seminar, in my opinion.","This is the class to take if you want an engaging, educational, semi-intensive introduction to the current discourse in political theory.","it's a really interesting class with a thorough overview of political theory. however, be prepared for a lack of diversity in thinkers and little structure. still a great class nonetheless"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 63","course_id":"2156","cat_num":"37498","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 63","course_id":"2156","cat_num":"37498","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 63","course_id":"2156","cat_num":"37498","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
