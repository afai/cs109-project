I strongly recommend for any students interested in learning the language as quickly and thoroughly as possible to take this course.","This is an excellent class provided you have learned a language linguistically before, particularly a romance language. It also takes a lot of time and regular work.","This class is the best way to jump start Spanish language learning in a semester.","DO IT!","This class is very difficult. Do not expect to get a good grade, but do expect to learn a lot of spanish.","This is the best class you will ever take at Harvard."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["If you are willing to put in the work and study a lot for the quizzes you can do well, and Sylvia is always there to help, she really wants to to be successful.","It is difficult and fast-paced but extremely fun and worth the time. You pick up the language fast.","It is difficult to learn a language in such a short amount of time and takes continual practice otherwise many things that you learn will be forgotten, especially since the pace is so fast.","This class is a great way to learn a lot of Spanish in a very short amount of time. It is a fun class and is definitely very enjoyable.","I would tell them that it's an intensive course for a reason. The class is very fast paced. But if you are interested in learning Spanish, then this is the best one to take as it will help them learn quickly in a short amount of time.","This class may sound intimidating on paper, but the workload is not as much as expected, and it's a really great opportunity to learn Spanish quickly, get to know some very interesting people since classes are so small, and work with incredible professors.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anybody considering studying Spanish.  I have really enjoyed taking this class and am severely disappointed that there is no intensive intermediate Spanish.  I can't explain enough how much I have enjoyed this class.","This course is among the best classes at Harvard. Going to class each day is a lot of fun. The small class size allowed me to get to know my classmates well which made for a great intimate language-learning experience. The quality of the teaching is outstanding. I have rarely seen such dedication to one's students by a teacher in my time as a student. Who knew learning a language could be so much fun? Now I want to learn more about the Spanish-speaking world!","The intensive program is great to get a general understanding of a language quickly, however, I worry that because of the rapidity of the course and the lack of time to let things \"seep in\" that I will lose this language quickly once leaving the course.  If possible, I would recommend Spanish A (non-intensive).  Also, though having taken another language makes taking a class at this level possible, it is also a stumbling block for some since you have to think yourself out of the other foreign language that you know better.","This course is demanding, and it moves quickly. In the beginning it may seem overwhelming, but you pick up the rhythm of quick language-learning, and then you can be strategic about and how much you practice and study outside of class. There's a certain satisfaction in not languishing with partial language-knowledge throughout two semesters and instead seeing your language improve from week to week in a one-semester intense course. Now, at the end of the semester, it's hard to imagine that in January of this year I hardly knew a word of Spanish.","Easily one of the best classes I took at Harvard.","This is one of the best classes you can take in terms of learning a language. I can't imagine a faster, more efficient, or better way to learn a language.","I would say that they should definitely consider taking it, but that it's pretty difficult.","It's the best language I have taken over my whole experience as a student.","the course is amazing, but definitely be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort.","This is a great course, and you will learn a lot, and if you want to learn Spanish quickly there is no better way. However, be prepared for it; it's not easy and it moves quickly. Stay on top of the work, and do your exercises every night, so the night before the quiz is not a disaster.","A wonderful way to get a strong grasp of the basic grammatical structures and vocabulary needed to communicate in Spanish in a short space of time. Ideal for anyone looking to see huge improvements quickly.","I've taken many language courses at some of the best institutions there are, and this is definitely the best I've ever taken! I strongly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn Spanish and learn it fast. This is one course I enjoyed waking up early because it was so much fun.","This course is a pretty serious time commitment, but it was well worth it.","This class is an incredible introduction to Spanish, encompassing everything from grammar to cultural education, and any student will be astonished at how much they learn in a mere four months.","Mariana is fantastic."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["It is one of the most fruitful and fun class I have taken so far; you can start speaking Spanish in 3 months ad have a lot of fun on your way there.","If you want to learn Spanish take Acd! It's basically complete immersion into a new language and ensures that you will leave with an incredible amount of knowledge and able to speak and write Spanish well.","Take this over Spanish Aa. Acd will be a thousand times more worthwhile because you'll learn a thousand times more without even realizing it. Getting access to this much face time with a professor is INVALUABLE.","This class is so amazing. It's incredible how quickly you'll learn Spanish.

You will learn so much Spanish it's nuts. So worth it!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This intensive language class exceeds all my expectations.

Mariana is an amazing instructor and you'll have a lot of fun studying it. DO NOT fall behind in the class, it's all downhill from there.","This class is amazing!!! It's just one term but you learn so much. It's kind of mind-boggling: after three months, I can speak\/read\/understand a good amount of Spanish. I would definitely take this class over Aa\/Ab; Acd feels like 1.5 classes at most but it counts for 2, you get to progress more quickly, and you get to have more motivated peers - since Acd can't fulfill the language requirement. And you get to have Mariana!","If you want to learn Spanish, TAKE THIS CLASS! You should do more work than the class asks of you (and the class already asks a lot of you), but incredibly you will be able to become proficient in Spanish in the span of four months. The instructor, Mariana San Mart\u00c3\u00adn is outstanding, fun, and available, and she really makes taking the class a pleasure.","This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard - you learn so much so quickly, and Mariana is a PHENOMENAL instructor.

Be ready for daily class at nine, and don't sign up if you can't commit, but if you do then you'll enjoy it","This was honestly the best and most fun class I've taken at Harvard.  Even after 6 weeks or so, you already have a deeper understanding of the language and can have basic conversations.  It's a great feeling!  Plus, while the assignments may take some time, they aren't difficult.  Mariana is fantastic!"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is a really great class if you're serious about learning Spanish. I would recommend really keeping up with the grammar because it can get difficult towards the end. And definitely practice SPEAKING with other students.","This course is very intensive but not too much and provides an excellent grounding in Spanish.","You need to study EVERYDAY. Seriously, and speak in class as much as physically possible.","This is an EXCELLENT class to learn an incredible amount of spanish in a very short time.  Do not underestimate this class as an intro language class, it is a challenging course in terms of the amount of material you will learn but that also makes it very rewarding.  Mariana is an amazing teacher and really does a great job of covering the material and making it interesting and engaging.","Don't fall behind - it's easy to push work in this class to the bottom of the barrel, but as soon as you fall even slightly behind you will be in deep trouble.","The course is a lot of fun!  Be prepared to spend some time memorizing vocabulary, but other than that, I can't see how the course could possibly be much harder than Aa or Ab.  It is really satisfying at the end of the course when you are able to have conversations easily in Spanish, and write essays with somewhat sophisticated language.  Mariana is also great!","Very enjoyable and useful! Just know how many class hours there are and make sure you have time for it.  How much time you spend a week is not a given, as it really depends on your ability\/competence with language.","Be ready to put in a substantial amount of time, especially if this is your first Romance language.","Take this course! This is a great way to learn Spanish. The course is engaging, interesting, and at times, rather entertaining. Plus, you get to hear some great Spanish music, which is definitely a plus. Definitely of the best courses I've taken here at Harvard, but be prepared to do the work required to make the most of it.","In a course that meets every day, it's imperative that you click with the instructor. That being said, I though Mariana was wonderful and I would have a hard time imagining someone who would not get along with her.","This course was one of the most rewarding I have taken at school. If you really want to learn Spanish, this is the best way to learn it (if you don't have time to fully immerse yourself in a spanish-speaking country, that is). The workload is difficult (there are times when you will have a presentation, ~3-hour CENTRO assignment, and 2-chapter quiz all in one week), but the assignments are very useful and satisfying. Mariana is all that you could want in an instructor-- she is kind, warm, supportive, thoughtful, understanding, and incredibly intelligent, organized, clear, and prepared. SHE is the reason this course is such a success. Her expectations are high, but that is because she believes in your ability to learn. She is extremely patient and encouraging and dispels any notions in a student that he\/she is a terrible language learner. I left the course with a confidence that with time, I could become very skilled at Spanish and I owe that largely to Mariana's nurturing teaching style.","This class is awesome!  Definitely take it if you want to learn Spanish - you'll be amazed at how much you learn over the course of the semester!","A phenomenal way to learn Spanish really quickly.  Mariana is an incredible teacher.  Think seriously about the 7 hr\/week time commitment before you enroll.  I took this with three other courses and a fair extracurricular load and found it to be a little too much.  The more time you put into this course, the better you'll get at Spanish!  Take advantage of this class before you graduate, and put in the time!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["I loved this class and I think it's the perfect senior year elective if you want to learn Spanish. You're in a class with other students who are also there because they want to learn Spanish, and you'll have a wonderful instructor if Mariana is still teaching the course.

Having a 9am class for 7 hours every week was a little annoying, but totally worth it. Mariana was a great instructor. The course counts as 2, and it's not quite as much work as taking 2 classes would be but it is more work than just one, so keep that in mind when picking other classes for the semester.

This course requires a lot of work and effort so only take it if you are prepared to do the work.","Take this class! It is amazing! Mariana is the best person ever. She is so patient and kind and really is there to help you out if you need it.  The class was wonderful and I learned Spanish!!  It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.","Very intensive!","When studying, practice reading Spanish aloud.  This not only helps your pronunciation and fluency, but it also helps you internalize the language and its grammar.","This is a great class! I don't think I could've learned Spanish any faster unless I had moved to a Spanish speaking country for the last 3 months.","it's a very good way to reach a basic level in a very short time. Definitely worth it.","If you want to learn Spanish, I can't imagine doing it any other way. I'd say it's equivalent to about 1.5 classes.

Take it if you want to learn Spanish--you'll be astonished at how fast you pick it up!","Fantastic course. I learned so much in just a few months. We went through a lot of content very quickly, but because the class was well taught and we had a lot of time to practice as a group, it never felt unmanageable.","This is the best language course I've ever taken; Mariana is an extremely enthusiastic and talented teacher. After one semester, you are able to converse in Spanish, read basic texts, and conjugate a verb in any tense present in the Spanish language. If you want to learn Spanish quickly, take this class!","If you want to learn the basics of Spanish in one semester, I will recommend this class with enthusiasm. Mariana is simply amazing, and the course materials are really interesting as well. Spanish Acd definitely takes up the hours and workload of two courses, so keep that in mind before you choose to take it.","Absolutely take it! Fun class environment, great TF, learned a lot","This is an absolutely amazing class. You walk in with absolutely NO prior knowledge of Spanish AT ALL. You walk out with a wide range of vocabulary and grammar rules, stellar reading comprehension and writing abilities (these skills were the most developed in my opinion) and pretty good oral communication and comprehension abilities (you will definitely get at least the general gist of most spoken Spanish and will for sure be able to communicate your thoughts, maybe not perfectly, but enough to get the idea across). Mariana is an absolute angel. An amazing teacher and a lovely person. Love her, love her, love her. Take the class just so you can have a learning experience with her."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Mariana is the sweetest woman in the world. Just know that when they say this class is intensive, they mean it. Do not take a heavy course load or commit yourself to a lot of extracurriculars while you're doing it.

Mariana was a superb teacher in every respect and handled the students' different needs and abilities really well. Whatever you do, you MUST keep up with the work - if you fall behind, it would be really hard to catch up. But the class is fantastic, and if you're serious about wanting to learn Spanish, this is the way to do it.","It is not really that difficult to keep up with the daily work, as long as you don't have too many other things going on.  Spanish is always worth learning!","This class is extremely rewarding; Mariana San Martin is an incredible instructor and extremely helpful. If you are good at languages, take this course without a doubt.

However, we did stray from the syllabus towards the middle of the class and that can be frustrating if you like to follow a concrete schedule and like to know what to expect in each class.","Before the semester began, I spoke no Spanish, but now I feel incredibly confident in understanding and reading Spanish. It has been a really fun class, and I've learned so much!","This is a really great class. You learn a lot and you learn quickly but Glenda supports your learning and is very responsive in terms of identifying and devoting extra time to concepts that are difficult for the class. The class is really fun with a lot of material outside the textbook including music and film. Glenda is a great and very kind teacher and you will enjoy this class! Stay on top of your work and review a little everyday and you will get great results.","Great class and Glenda is awesome - can be a little disorganized at times but definitely provides you with a solid background in Spanish.","In terms of workload, homework assignments, stuff you have to turn in etc., the class isn't *incredibly* intensive (i.e. you can take 5 classes (=4 classes total) and still be fine). That being said, if you want to make the most of it and learn as much Spanish as possible, you'll really have to put in a lot of work on your own, without anyone telling you to do so, or the \"pressure\" of a grade. You'll go over a LOT of vocabulary, a LOT of conjugation (as in, all the tenses, which can get a little confusing), and that kind stuff only sticks well if you're willing to spend the time to memorize and review it, over and over and again. So I'd say the class works best if you have good work ethics.\r\nOverall I had a great experience (but also keep in mind that yours may vary depending on your instructor \/classmates)."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course is conceived and reserved to a specific minority of students, which makes it hard to recommend to anyone. It is however great for learning the basis of the Spanish language, though another Spanish course is required in order to master it.","If you are thinking of traveling abroad, this is like a crash course boot camp that will whip you in shape to be able to communicate.","Be prepared for an experience. You will become a family and learn so much. It can be a lot of work but also a lot of fun and a great way to learn a language.","This is a great class for those really interested in learning a lot of Spanish in a short period of time. You come out being able to understand and speak an impressive amount for just one semester. I'm not sure if Glenda will still be teaching, but she was absolutely wonderful. She was always enthusiastic and really cares about everyone. She even cooked for us a few times!  The amount of class time may seem like a lot, but it doesn't feel very long when you're actually there. They use a lot of songs and videos to supplement the material, so class is always interesting"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH Acd","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"5577","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH Acd","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"5577","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH Acd","course_id":"4475","cat_num":"5577","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
