Practice away from books needs to take place, but didn't.","Be able to listen to Korean!"]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Very fun, interactive.","Professor Kim is awesome. I would recommend this class with 100% confidence.","The most fun class I've taken at Harvard."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This will be a very rewarding class if you work very hard."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Kim SSN is the best teacher in the Korean Language Department, so definitely take it if she is teaching it. She will make it fun, but you will also learn so much in one semester. 130 is the level where some native Koreans or almost fluent Koreans start taking Korean language classes, so depending of the background of the students, the class may be harder. If everyone is not fluent at Korean, then the class will be slightly easier and you will move more slowly through the lessons. It is a big jump from the 120 level.","Was a really fun tight knit class","Take it! ..... but of course, not without taking 130a (and hopefully 120ab) first!","Korean 130b is fantastic! Kim SSN is an amazing instructor, and the class was  always fun and interesting.","Professor Kim is really great!","Regardless of which section you are in, you will be challenged to push yourself in all aspects of Korean -- reading, speaking, and writing.","rewarding class but requires hard work if you want to take your korean to the next level.","Korean 130 is a great class where you will befriend nearly everyone. You really learn a ton of vocabulary, but it never seems excessive and is really well done. You will find yourself just naturally using more sophisticated Korean. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is the most fun class I have ever taken at Harvard! You will also improve your Korean speaking ability significantly.","Korean is a course that you will get out of what you put in. The baseline workload for this class is very light, almost no homework besides writing journals. Feedback that you get is great and detailed and Jung SSN really took the time to follow up individually. The best part of this course though was getting to know your fellow classmates. If you make the effort you can create a really tight community and it makes the class so much more fun.","This class is awesome- hands down one of my favorite classes so far at Harvard. The teacher's wonderful, funny, kind, and so incredibly willing to help her students and willing to take time out of her schedule to answer questions and make sure her students are doing well in the class. I've made so many good friends in this class and it's just a lot of fun. Also, it was awesome learning Korean in a foreign language context which I had never done before.","This was my favorite class this semester! The debates were on really engaging subjects such as online dating, necessity of marriage, college degrees, etc. They really helped listening and speaking skills. Jung ssn is so nice, accessible, and works so so hard to teach you well and give you great feedback. \r\n\r\nAlso, the people in this class are my favorite. I literally want to be friends with them forever. Put the time in to get to know your class! It makes learning and studying SO much more fun.","Jung SSN is the best teacher ever.
