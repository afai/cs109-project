Talk more and get involved.","It's a blast! It will make you change the way you think about your life, and especially about your death. It will be a lot of fun, and definitely use what you learn outside of the classroom. That is the best part about the things you can learn in this class, the stimulating conversations they can inspire among your friends.","Make an effort to foster discussion during class and time might pass by quicker.","This course will be different from any other course you have taken in high school. It will test your ability to think abstractly, but if you focus on the paper and attend office hours, you will be able to write extensively on one topic.","This is a very interested class. If you have a lot of questions about death, this class will help you greatly. You will end up with more questions than answers but that's the beauty of philosophy. Professor Chen is amazing and I really enjoyed this seminar.","Take this course with an open mind about the field of philosophy.  I knew nothing about philosophy before taking this course but now I am very interested in the field.","Get ready for one of the most interesting classes and discussions you've ever had about some of life's most grappling questions","This is an excellent introduction to philosophy for those with a prior interest in the subject. It may feel dry for someone unsure of their interest in the discipline, but the readings are fascinating and cover a wide range of topics such as value, morality, suffering, etc.","Though the class was generally interesting and touched upon some very unique issues, the execution was not always great. The discussions in class were sometimes lackluster and didn't get the whole class involved. What could have been very interesting discussions because of the readings turned into long, drawn-out talks about just specific parts of the book."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 30q","course_id":"12359","cat_num":"19355","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 30q","course_id":"12359","cat_num":"19355","1s":"8","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
