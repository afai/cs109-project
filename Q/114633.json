Chris is amazing and it has been a great opportunity to get to work with him.","great professor, fun class","I would recommend this class with enthusiasm! You will definitely become a better over all picture taker. One of the most difficult things to do is it learn how to represent the complexities of a human being in a portrait. You will learn how to accomplish this task technically and you will learn how to think more deeply about what exactly a portrait is.","Photo classes are hard to get into and a lot of work\/commitment, but well worth the shot!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you love to do photography and people then this is for you. I like how this class has allowed me to experiment with the medium format camera without thinking of the costs. Plus you'd end up with a portrait book, developing it under the guidance of Chris and Nori. I recommend also to do office hours with Chris, he gives more personalized feedback that way. I wish though that students would be more vocal during crits.","Wonderful course, and a great way to focus purely on portraiture.  Chris gives excellent feedback, and you have a wealth of resources.","Chris is an amazing professor who has helped me grow immensely as a photographer. I loved making a book for the final project, as it left me with a concrete product from the class. However, he is not the right teacher for everyone. Go to the first class of the semester and see for yourself!","This course is very time consuming, but very rewarding!","Such a great class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.38","difficulty":"2.71","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 146r","course_id":"5202","cat_num":"5743","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 146r","course_id":"5202","cat_num":"5743","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 146r","course_id":"5202","cat_num":"5743","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
