Your opinions will change, probably by the week.","This class was very interesting because it combined a lot of different topics into a few very interesting themes throughout the class. We learned a lot of very useful techniques about creating and giving presentations. Learning magic tricks was also a very fun part of the class.","This seminar is really, really fun! Professor Kuriyama is a very interesting person, and the reading are strange but good. You'll be asked many vague\/hard questions that don't really have any answers to them. Be prepared to learn some cool magic tricks!","A very mixed mag of a class, because you will learn everything from philosophy, to magic tricks, to money etc. If you are interested in those specific areas, take this class.","It's a really relaxed seminar, but you do get the chance to discuss and read about some interesting topics with philosophical implications.","It's a fun and intriguing seminar.","This is a low-stress class that addresses some interesting issues, although if you're looking for concrete and easily applicable answers about the nature of money, you may be hard-pressed to find them.","Interesting, fun course that will challenge a lot of what you think about the world. Kuriyama is a gem. Such a brilliant, open, fascinating professor. Not a lot of traditional assignments but you should have a fair bit of creativity! Almost everything I wanted out of a freshman seminar."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.20","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 31e","course_id":"10801","cat_num":"40822","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 31e","course_id":"10801","cat_num":"40822","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 31e","course_id":"10801","cat_num":"40822","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
