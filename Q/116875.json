It's not an extremely difficult or demanding course unless your play throws you for a loop.","Liz is a wonderful instructor.

And without sounding too cliche, Professor Marks really challenges you as a writer. He's more than willing to meet and talk out your stories and assist you in bringing them to life. It was difficult if you really take advantage of his suggestions. And at times frustrating. But that's what made it so worthwhile. \r\n\r\nLooking at the class as a whole, his quirky assignments are a lot of fun to write. Workshopping them is hysterical. The plays you read are surprisingly really helpful for your own writing. It's really set up for you to grow, which says a lot about the strength of the course. If you have any interest in playwriting or testing yourself as a writer, don't be afraid take this course.","Prof. Marks is completely amazing and the syllabus will expose you to a wide range of dramatic styles and devices, but this class is too big. You won't get as much feedback on your work as you'll want, which was frustrating for me as a first-time playwright. Take the class, but be sure to also take advantage of office hours.","Professor Marks is really engaging and the class size\/format facilitates great discussion.","Take this class!!!! This was the best class I took this semester! Sam Marks is the bomb, and from what I've heard from people who took playwriting before, he is a lot better than the last teacher. Write early and often. The course isn't a huge time commitment but I found myself staying up lat Sunday night because I hadn't written the assignment. And start thinking about your final play asap!","If you have the opportunity to take a creative writing class.... TAKE IT. Sam Marks is great... he is insightful and funny... and he made this class very enjoyable.","Helpful and constructive.

Sam Marks can handle the student who knows everything about the subject already, as well as open the door for the kid who knows nothing. You will produce things that surprise you, and learn how  to keep expanding.","great intro to playwriting! I had never written a play in my life and I came out of this class having written a full play that I was satisfied with. Concrete advice on playwriting, you read cool stuff and Sam is extremely encouraging and helpful. Loved my experience. Also learned a BUNCH from my amazing peers in the class. Talented writers teach each other a lot.","Sam is a great mentor. The class doesn't ever feel as long as it actually is because he keeps it fresh and fast paced. And it's awesome to share your writing and hear other people's! Always share something, even if you feel iffy about it. Everyone is there to improve their writing so everyone is really helpful!","This class is great for anyone interested in the world of the stage, whether they are creative writers who want to write for the stage, or actors, directors or people otherwise involved in theater to look at plays from a new point of view.","This is a great class, taught by a wonderful professor. The feedback you receive on your play is very helpful, as is the emphasis the class places on finding your unique voice as a playwright. The plays read in class are a useful way to explore the possibilities of the stage, and explore ideas that work for your own writing.","This is an excellent introduction to playwriting. Professor Marks is fantastic, and you are guaranteed of exiting the class having become a better playwright, and having produced a complete draft of a one-act play. Also, you get to read a bunch of wonderful plays and meet a bunch of interesting people."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["In no other class at Harvard are you encouraged to go nuts and write a play, whatever it may be. It's rather exciting.","If you've ever wanted to learn about what thought process (or lack thereof) goes into writing a play, or want an opportunity to improve your craft, definitely consider this class!","This class is amazing!!! But really. You really get to explore your own writing style, and the class is much more about helping you develop yourself as a writer rather than teaching you how to write a play. That may sound bad, given that the class is called \"playwriting\", but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that writing is a very individual process, with no hard and steady rules. And this class really emphasized that personal development, which is great!","Harvard creative writing is phenomenal, and Intro Playwriting is not an exception.  Sam Marks is one of the most useful people to have criticizing your work, especially at the early stages.  Being able to write so much creative work for one class and get consistently solid feedback is absolutely amazing.  Everyone should talk at least one creative writing course at Harvard. Everyone.","This was hands-down my favorite course this semester. You will be challenged to produce quality work, but it's a very fun challenge to rise to.","This is the best class I have ever taken.","This is a great class. If you've ever been interested in theater and wanted to try creative writing or if you were just interested in creative writing and wanted to try something new this is a great way to get a introduction to that area of english.","Good class, but I would have liked to be pushed more. Great readings, and Sam is great about being concrete and specific about techniques that accomplish things on stage.","This class was my favorite by far of the entire semester. Though I had had playwriting experience before enrolling in English Ckr, I grew significantly as a playwright. At the end of this course, you will have written an entire one-act play, and that is an incredible accomplishment.","If you have ever wanted to write a play or see what the Creative Writing department is like, this is a great class that will give you a positive experience of both. Also, contrary to popular knowledge, nothing is off limits when you're writing a play."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"4.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH Ckr","course_id":"1471","cat_num":"6781","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH Ckr","course_id":"1471","cat_num":"6781","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH Ckr","course_id":"1471","cat_num":"6781","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
