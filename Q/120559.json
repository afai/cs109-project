I think the class will be shaped by the person you are with. For me, my experience was just terrific and the person I was with was so passionate and very responsive and we used to meet for coffee and I really learned a lot.","This is a great experience to work one on one with a researcher. If you're interested in knowing what it's like to do research, thinking deeply about a subject for a semester, or just want a really good class, take this, you'll love it!","you get to learn about interesting topics, if your grad student is learning about interesting topics.","This class can be as much as you make of it. Take initiative if you want to pursue psychology more intensely, as your mentor will be thrilled to provide you with advice. Research your own topics, come up with ideas, etc, if this is your plan. However, if you just want to experiment with a lab, this course can also be useful. It won't be too much work and you can see how a lab is run."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I think your experience would wholly depend on who you were working with.","It's a great class to take if you're interested in the research side of psychology and business! But it is highly dependent on how much you make of your own tasks\/assignments.","I wouldn't take it again. Low commitment but no idea on how I'm doing (still). Low contact with real faculty. You're just assistants and feel very used--the work you do requires no thinking and you wonder why it isn't automated. The b school does an excellent job of making this look nice but in reality it isn't a course for those who tire from busy work. In fact it's hardly a course since you just work with a phD student.","This is a great opportunity to get course credit for research experience. Be prepared to work very independently; the experience is very rewarding!","This is a GREAT opportunity if you want some experience working in a psych lab, and since there's so much freedom it's a very independent style of working, which is great. Highly encouraged, especially if you need a lab credit for psych!","I think it really depends on who you have for a TF. Mine was really busy and as a result would send me assignments at weird times and expect them to be done the next day, regardless of what class assignments I had.","Julia is extremely considerate of your class schedule. She will deliberately not assign you any work during midterm\/paper season. This is a great intro to behavioral economics\/psychology research for those who are interested.","depends on the grad student, but mine gave me very interesting work with minimal time requirements","Depends on who your researcher is. I definitely had some valuable experiences (running studies, etc.), but a lot of work would be assigned super last minute and end up being more stressful and tedious than actually educational.","This is a great way to get hands-on research experience especially if you get matched up with a doctoral student who shares your interests.","This is really a great exposure to those who want to have a sample of what doing research in organizational behavior\/behavioral economics is like. BTW, Andrew Brodsky is the best doctoral student to work with. Intelligent, humble, supporting, and patient, you couldn't ask for a better supervisor.","if you're interested in research, it's a great way to also get credit.","This course is a great way to be introduced to the methods behind Psychology studies.","This is a great way to get a sense of how social psychology research is done, which questions are asked and what the common procedures are"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is an excellent opportunity to take part in research if you have never done so before, not too demanding.","This was an awesome class! Super chill but you get to do stuff that's actually really interesting. Assignments can take some time but this varies throughout the semester. Andrew is the best -- super helpful and really taught us a lot. Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in behavioral psych, no background required.","Take this course! I worked with Julia Lee who was absolutely tremendous and gave great feedback. It's a great chance to look into how research is done at Harvard!","Fun way to gain insight into current research. Your experience will highly depend on the PhD student to whom you are assigned.","If you want to work closely with grad students\/faculty at HBS and get experience with research, THIS IS THE CLASS. Best experience ever.","Very interesting course","I loved working with my mentor the entire semester. I learned more about the research process than I even could have learned in a class. It was wonderful to see the work I did actually applied to the research my mentor was doing. I also learned a lot about SPSS and Qualtrics, which I will be using in the future.","how much you enjoy this lab will depend on your relationship with your grad student. i wish i had more opportunities to really engage with the lab, instead of only meeting with the lab supervisor every week for 20 minutes","Psych 2553r is a great way to get hands-on experience in the lab and learn an enormous amount about what goes into research and the whole process. The schedule is fairly flexible and the work is usually interesting and all of the people that you work with area so interesting and supportive. I definitely recommend this course, especially as a 5th class that isn't super stressful or as a 4th class if you have a tough workload in your other 3 classes.","If you get a good TF, this may be a good course. However, I would definitely not recommend this course. It feels like it was created as a way for PhD students to take advantage of free labor, holding the threat of 'poor grades' above the heads of the students. I have worked with many labs\/researchers - this has been by far the worst experience.","If you're looking to fulfill your psych lab requirement and are interested in the intersection of psychology\/business\/econ, this is the lab for you!","be flexible"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A positive attitude to learn from the doctoral students at HBS is needed. The projects are all unique and enjoyable!","This \"class\" gives you real-life experience with running research, but what you get to do completely depends on the grad student you are assigned to. Some students get to do more, some students get to do less. I was able to assist in running a pretty cool study, but my interests weren't really matched. You also only get to interact with Professor Gino about once. An easy class, but those looking to learn more from a lab might want to look somewhere else.","This is a lab course and Gino's lab is quite a big lab, so actually I never met or worked with Professor. Gino herself. But I really enjoy working with the graduate student I am assigned too this semester. This could be a good fifth class as it is a good way to learn about psychology research without much heavy workload. Though the lab hours are a big time commitment if you don't plan carefully.","Great if you are interested in business \/ consumer decision-making, and need a class with flexible hours without too much time commitment. Very loosely-structured, and your experience largely depends on the lab mentor or project you get assigned to.","I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in gaining insight into research considering the interaction between economics and psychology.","Not hard, but definitely a significant time commitment.","In this course I worked as a position in a lab.
