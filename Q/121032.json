Enjoy, and make sure to keep up with the material and to analyze the grammar in every sentence, rather than settle on a translation only.  It will be helpful in preparing for the tests.","Professor Cranston's classical Japanese courses are the best classes I've had at Harvard.","The material can be challenging at times, but Prof. Cranston's teaching style is such that difficult passages will never be left not worked out. Overall, the class is rewarding both for the skills in Classical Japanese that are developed, and also for the interesting discussions that come out of the readings -- on classical literature and culture, and etymology of the Japanese language."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Independent knowledge and willingness to work outside of class is necessary","Professor Cranston throws you in the deep end, but you learn a LOT in the end.","Wonderful class. Speed of the class depends on the students (how many questions asked, how closely people want to examine the grammar). Sometimes difficult to know how much you need to prepare because you never know how many questions people will have that day.","If you want to sit down and read a masterpiece from a thousand years ago (Heian Japan) and try to catch the essence of each word of it, come to this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.17","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"JAPAN 106c","course_id":"845","cat_num":"7307","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
