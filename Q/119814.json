The workload was not very high and the assignments were interesting. This course should not be thought of as only for ESPP or OEB concentrators but for anyone who is interested in conservation."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This class should absolutely be taken!  Navjot was great!","recommend to students interested in the subject","GREAT PROFESSOR; but Prof. Sodhi is a visiting professor, so he will likelyl not be teaching this course.","You get to hear talks from the best minds in conservation biology, what could be better?","Professor Sodhi is amazing. Additionally, he brought in many visiting professors to talk about their work and their ideas on conservation. Overall, the course was a great experience.","Professor and thus overall experience changes every year."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["The Professor is wonderful-- although he's a visiting Prof, so things may change in subsequent years.","Amazing course. Covered interesting material, got to know other students and professor well.","This is a great chance to learn about conservation biology in a small seminar setting with a visiting professor from outside Harvard. Take advantage of this unique opportunity!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["participate","It's so interesting, and it's exciting to learn from people involved in the field of whale conservation in a laid-back atmosphere with a small group of students.","Take this course, nothing like it at Harvard.  Per is the man, and even though he will be gone you will have someone good too, just not as awesome.","This is a great class: the format allows for a different guest lecturer each week with thorough discussion, and I learned a lot about conservation biology of the whales. Do note that the course has a different visiting professor each year, but if it's anything like this year's, it's definitely worth taking.","WHALES ROCKED!!!  If you are interested in marine conservation, this (was) a must take (since I don't think it's being offered again).  We had really interesting conversations about conservation and the course forced me to really question some of my beliefs about conservation.  Professor was really great too!  We took the best field trip ever!  Overall, a really inspiring class.","A wonderful introduction to the principles of conservation biology.","This class is so baller and super easy. Take it. Especially if you're into conservation, animals, and\/or whales. Also your friends will be so jealous that you're taking a class called \"Large Whale Conservation\" coming home with facts like \"Did you know that Humpback whales migrate 8,000 km a year just to breed in warm water?\"  Per (the professor) is also really cool.  The speakers that come to the class each week are great and they've written all of the papers you read (or actually just skim) for the class each week.  Great class, I recommend it with enthusiasm.","Great elective course","I know the professor changes every year, but if it were Per again\/another genetics teacher, I would say that you should only take the class if you are extremely interested in genetics.","I know the subject matter changes yearly, but this is really the only conservation class you will have the opportunity to take and it's FABULOUS"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["There is a different professor every year, so I can't really say much about whether or not I would recommend the course.  I would certainly advise shopping it; if the professor next year is half as good as Dr. James, then it will be a great experience.","So this course won't be the same topic next year, but conservation is a great thing to learn about so take it!","This was the best class I have taken at Harvard","Truly fantastic class. I was one of only five students in this great course. We learned so much and even took awesome field trips, including to Washington, DC. Dr. James was great and it's a shame she won't be teaching the course again. I can't believe how lucky I was to be in such a small and engaging course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ESPP 90e","course_id":"1570","cat_num":"6879","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ESPP 90e","course_id":"1570","cat_num":"6879","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ESPP 90e","course_id":"1570","cat_num":"6879","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
