killed my interest in Spanish.","Make sure to be prepared in class, participation counts!","It is a very useful course as my speaking skills actually did improve quite a bit.  I suppose that depends on your TF but in general, this course is effective.","It's a fairly painless way to improve your spoken Spanish but when it comes to grammar and vocabulary, you will have to take initiative to make substantial improvements.","This class is extremely helpful for those who want to increase their comfort level with the Spanish language.","ivan is el hombre","Great way to improve oral skills without a heavy course-load.","This class is only as good as the effort you put into it.  Requires a lot of independant learning.","Because this class is structured so differently from most at Harvard, it is a great way to balance your schedule and to do something fun and different for the semester.","It is a very engaging course that allows students to quickly and actively improve their speaking skills.","Participation is key so if you are not comfortable speaking spanish and if you don't think you will be able to speak in front of people, don't take this course.","Too much work!","Be prepared to spend lots of time writing essays.  It is just time consuming then.","low-stress course, improves spanish skills, not having exams is great, TFs are all great, it's consistent work but never too much, i highly recommend it","This class teaches spanish in a fun and interactive way - so the learning process is extremely productive.","It is a very enjoyable class that provides a great opportunity to keep your oral Spanish skills fresh.","Participate in class! It's your grade!","It's easy, and a good way to practice your Spanish, but the work can be tedious and boring. It also runs through reading period, which is SOOOOO FRUSTRATING","This class provides a wonderful forum for exploration and discussion of contemporary issues in Latin America and the world at large.  Course materials including videos and stories are all very intriguing and intellectually stimulating.","Don't forget to practice before class!","Take this! It's great! You will learn so much and have fun in the process. The sheer variety of assignments alone keeps things interesting and there is no doubt that you will bond with your peers. However, if you think it'll be difficult for you to commit at least some time to the class every day, you might think a little before taking it. It does involve more continuous work than some other classes.","This class is not that hard, it's tons of fun, and approaches language the way it should be learned--as a day to day endeavor. Dramatic, I know.","Very easy to manage, develop confidence with speaking, get to read and watch interesting pieces of Spanish literature and film.","If you are looking to boost your confidence with your oral skills, this is the class for you.","Alicia is great!  You learn so much too!","the class is a little bit too hard, because we were supposed to study oral spanish, and most of the time, we had to write compositions and do written exercises. however, just because of the instructors, who really teach well, students should take the course.","This is a great class. Participate and seize the opportunity to speak a lot.","Good way to practice your Spanish.","This class is great for getting to know other students while speaking spanish. Wide variety of topics covered during class. be sure you're not shy because otherwise you will suffer participation wise!  I had to fight off my peers for airtime!","be prepared for extensive participation","it's a fun course","Don't be afraid to speak up.","This class is horrible, but necessary if you want a citation.","It's a lot of work.","It is a great course, if you are adequately prepared for it.","Your spanish will improve. Period.","Honestly, its a very easy class that you can do well in if you put in enough time of your weekly composition. You MUST start off on the right foot!!","Ivan is great (if you're lucky enough to get him), but the class overall is very fun.  The work is manageable and it really does help make Spanish easier to speak.","be prepared to participate","Very fun class that helps you learn a lot and does not have a midterm or final.","This class is a great opportunity to strengthen conversational skills","Its a little heteronormative. There was a gay girl in the class, and several times the course made me feel uncomfortable on her behalf.","Expect to invest the time each week. It is a great opportunity to expand your Spanish speaking skills, but you will have assignments due each week so plan ahead. Also, there is a strict policy about absences and since several course sessions fall over part of the winter break (especially if you are a student from one of the professional schools) plan accordingly and be willing to do the make up sessions.","i think this course is great for people who really want to improve their spanish, but people should realize that it will be a fairly time intensive experience. there is a fair amount of work outside of class (which i did not expect).","It is a great Spanish class to take for any requirement or to improve your speaking skills.","The class is really fun. There is work but it is enjoyable, and the assignments truly improve your Spanish fluency.","it's not that hard, but overall spanish definitely improves","Definitely take this course if you are looking to improve you speaking skills without boring vocabulary quizzes and grammer tests. My improvement with the language felt very natural and unforced. Also, there was a good balance with media, conversation, presentation, games, essay writing, and reading.","It is a great class to improve your overall speaking ability in Spanish.","if you are looking for a class to focus on conversation and improve your oral skills, i do not think this is the one to take.","I'd tell them it's not fully a speaking course, there's a lot more writing than advertised.","If you're discouraged by mediocre experiences in Spanish Ca and Cb, then take this course. Unlike those two prerequisites, Spanish 30 provokes consistently relevant discussions on topics including current events, politics, film, and literature. Be prepared to speak up in class, but don't worry--your peers' level of proficiency will vary greatly, and all of you will improve significantly over the course of the semester. Speak up, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. One Spanish 30 student consistently forgot that the \"h\" in \"hablar\" is silent, and I think he still did fine.","This was a great class, especially with Roberto!","This course is extremely flexible and manageable. It is a great course to work towards a citation.","It is extremely applicable to real life situations! More so than a primarily literature based class.","it is fun, not that hard","this is a great class because it is held in small groups, is fun and has little work","In order to benefit from the class, you have to make an effort to take the speaking assignments seriously.  Although it is possible to do well without putting in any effort, you will not benefit from the class unless you do."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["choose a tf carefully","Easy, but not if you're actually trying to improve your Spanish.

At the same time it is a lot of fun.","A low-stress, high-yield immersion in Spanish speaking.","This class is really fun! The work is minimal and the whole class is centered around having normal, everyday conversations, so it sometimes feels like getting together in a room and just hanging out with 10 other people. I have heard, though, that the experience greatly differs depending on your TF, and I think I lucked out. I thought it was a very enjoyable class and it improved my speaking ability a whole lot.","I had so much fun in this class! I was able to discuss relevant topics in the news with my peers on a daily basis.","Great class, but I think alot of that was because of the teacher.","An all-around great course.","Such a fun class and the topics discussed are so interesting.

Writing skills will improve greatly, though.","It was really hard, there was too much work, I thought it would be my favorite class and it was by far my least favorite.","I recommend it, but if you get Prisca, take it with a different TF. Your experience in this course is highly dependent upon the TF you get.","Someone of my level might be more comfortable in Spanish C instead of 30","Understand Spanish grammar before taking this course.","You might not get as much of a chance to speak Spanish as you might have hoped, but this course introduces you to a wide range of Latin American countries and their literature. There will definitely be time to do language review, if you are feeling a little rusty, but make sure you can understand well.","This course may not improve your spoken Spanish, but if you work hard, your reading and writing skills will improve.","The TFs are great and the class was a lot of fun.  I learned a lot about the countries we studied.","I really enjoyed it.  It was quite a bit of work, but I liked that I learned a lot.","The readings are interesting and the workload is very manageable if you're comfortable with your Spanish reading skills.","the class depends on the section leader","I really enjoyed this class -- the readings were good and my TF was awesome.  It was one of my favorite classes.  I was worried that it was all in section with a TF, but it turned out to be a wonderful system, since the class size was small and my TF felt exactly like any other teacher in terms of knowledge and helpfulness.","The material is usually very interesting, and I think that my Spanish has improved. In particular, my writing and vocabulary have gotten much better.","if it is at one's level, it's a very good course","You will only get out of the course what you decide to put into it.","Taking a language is great because it has a different feel than many other classes. The classes are small, allowing discussions to be intimate and really interesting.","I'd say I think a lot of it depends on how good the teacher is...but Paul was great!","This course provided me with a solid and manageable introduction to \"advanced\" college-level language studies.","It depends on the section leader you get, because from what I hear grading varies a lot.","I would likely only recommend this class to students who need to fulfill a language requirement.","This is a great class to jump into if you took spanish in the past, then took some time off (which is what I did). It is better to jump into than spanish C because spanish C has too much variation in the spanish abilities of its students. The material covered is very interesting, and if you engage yourself fully in class discussions, you'll improve your spanish a lot.","There are so few lower-level spanish classes, students will not have any choice.","This class is a advanced class that allows you to practice your Spanish speaking skills and continue working on grammar while exploring Spanish culture and art.","Your section leader will make or break the course! I had a horrible section leader and, as a result, the course was very unpredictable and unfairly confusing\/difficult.","This class is a good combination of being light on work, but effective and helpful regardless.  Obviously, the more you put in, the more you get out, but simply by studying for tests and attending section, you learn a lot.","This class adds a little spice to regular grammar and vocab of a lower level class. While challenging, the reading and writing is an exciting new experience!","It's a good class. Not too much work, but you definitely have to manage your time with it. Don't leave anything until the last minute... spread it out. But yeah, it's a good class.","It's a difficult class but I don't feel that I learned very much from it.","Spanish 30 as a course is straightforward and interesting, but the TF that you are assigned can really make or break the course, so shop each section carefully.","not too intense, more likely to improve spanish with hight level course","Coursework was interesting and fun, but I think my particular class suffered through a poor TF.","carmen is the best teacher ever","The readings were really interesting and the papers had fun topics. It was a really fun class and my Spanish skills really improved.","If you'd like to improve your spanish, become more fluent, and have fun while doing so, take this class!","Be prepared to dedicate some time to the readings and essays, and only take it if you enjoy learning the language and about different Latin American cultures because it goes in depth in these areas.","If you are looking to earn a citation in the Spanish language, this course is a perfect choice. The material is interesting and thought provoking.","This is a great course to take, just make sure that when shopping it and assigned a section leader you do not receive the same TF that I had.","Take this course for the TF's.  They are interesting and very personal people and really make the course worthwhile.","This class can be a little challenging at times, but overall is very manageable and helpful if you wish to improve your spanish.","Spanish 30 is a great course for language review and developing speaking and writing skills.  It's a relatively easy class with a moderate workload, and a great way to enhance your confidence in Spanish.","It's a well-organized course with solid material.  The excellent TF on top of this make it both straightforward and enjoyable.","It is a good amount of work. If you keep up with the work the class is not that hard. It is a fun class and the teacher was fantastic","This course is essential to furthering one's study of the Spanish language. It is both helpful and informative, and allows for a furthering of knowledge in many different areas: culturally and grammatically. It allows for practice in reading, writing, hearing, and speaking Spanish, which is necessary.","This class is a great way to transition from Spanish C. It's value doesn't just lie in learning the language; I also learned a great deal about the cultures of Peru, Chile and other countries.","* Paul is a wonderful teacher--try to be in his section. \r\n* You will get out of it what you put into it.","This class is great and not too much work but you have to be sure to do the little work that is given.","Be prepared for alot of work.","Interesting class, and a good review of basic grammar. Unfortunately, you spend very little time on each piece, so you won't get a very good understanding of the individual works. You spend most of your time just trying to understand what was said in the text.","The class has a really good balance of grammar review and literature, so you're not stuck doing only grammar exercises but you do get to review that foundation.","Comparable to Spanish C (I tried both), but the reading assignments in Spanish 30 really help you get a lot more out of the class.","A great stepping stone to becoming more proficient in Spanish.","The course itself isn't that difficult. All that matters is your teacher. If you get a good teacher that class will be fine. If you get a hard teacher that class will be not fun at all. Ask around and see what teachers you should take.","This class is a good language learning tool, but the amount of study time you put in is the actual factor in your experience. I found that, though the class was helpful, I didn't learn that much without preparing and bringing the discussion to class.","Spanish 30 needs some time to get better organized.","More reading and less speaking than you would find in Spanish A or C.","Its a great way to practice speaking Spanish, and you also get to read some good stories.","This class is a great way to improve your Spanish in all areas - writing, speaking, listening.","Take it!","This class provides a great opportunity to improve your spanish both gramatically and in writing.","As long as you do the readings, complete the homework assignments and go to class you'll do fine on the exams and written compositions.","Very solid class, lots of fun and learning, very useful","It depends on your TF.","Go to language tables and 30 minute tutor sessions in boylston every week."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It is a very good course designed to strengthen the understanding of the Spanish language.","If you want to brush up on your Spanish this is a good way to do it.","I would recommend the class if you want to improve your Spanish.","From this course, you will become a better Spanish writer and you will be able to better understand Spanish in the written form.","Great way to balance out your schedule, fun and useful course","It's definitely a step-up from C, but I found myself improving just as much. So I've come to like the course a lot.","This class was fun, interesting, challenging, and well worth the time and effort it required. The course reviews basic Spanish grammar and focuses on the nuances of the language through its reading and writing assignments. The material is presented in an engaging manner and the environment of the class is very low-key and interactive.","This class not only broadens your grasp on the Spanish language, it also introduces you to the cultures and themes of Spanish-speaking nations.","It's a pretty easy class, and a lot of fun.","a great review and not too challengin if you're proficient in the language","This class is great for learning Spanish!","Very fun, very interesting, learn a lot","Good spanish class with really cool, culturally\/historically relevant readings.","Don't underestimate the workload and the material.  The material is difficult, but very interesting so it's fun but tough at the same time.","It's an excellent course!  You should set aside time outside of class to work on your speaking ability, however, because section isn't enough.","It's not a very effective way to learn Spanish, I don't think, but if you want to do a Harvard summer program abroad in a Spanish-speaking country, it's worth taking just to ensure that your skills don't fall too far behind.","It's a great way to continue your career of Spanish at Harvard","I would recommend this class with 100% confidence. Every student gets something out of it.","It's harder than spanish C.","Students should be prepared to practice Spanish outside of class, and they should be willing to dedicate time to the readings (sometimes, it is necessary to read a foreign-language piece 2 or 3 times).","I enjoyed the class-work, but not the preceptor. As a required course, it was fine however it was not so different from Spanish C.","Good way to improve your Spanish and easy GPA booster.","Unfortunately, the other students in this class I think were largely taking it to meet the language requirement, and so weren't necessarily very interested in Spanish or in languages in general. But the readings were interesting, although I wish there had been more emphasis on analyzing the readings rather than on politics.","It is not as easy as Spanish C, but more rewarding.  The literature is really interesting- you learn a lot about the countries that you read about and watch movies about.  Be prepared, however, to do nightly homework that can seem nitty-gritty at times.","Harder than Spanish C for sure, but really good readings and a nice leisurely pace with grammatical review.","It may be easy to coast through this course, but putting in the effort to really do the readings and engage with the course is definitely worth it.","Fun, relatively easy, and really interesting. Definitely a good class to balance a hectic load, and a great way to become more familiar with some literature and culture of the Spanish-speaking world.","Pretty easy course, just like Spanish 30. Same structure too, but different material. A fun class overall.","Very fast improvement in Spanish","Don't take it, unless you plan on getting a citation, or more.","Not too difficult, very enjoyable, great section leader.","The class does a great job of teaching students how to read in spanish and how to figure out what different words mean without looking them up but instead using context clues.","It is a great way to improve your language skills - Harvard has an amazing Spanish program!","A fairly straightforward, well-thought out course with an easy course load. At times, it felt like high school--mostly due to the energy of the students, not the aspirations of the instructor. This could be a good or a bad thing. If you're a freshman and you want the \"Harvard experience\"-- i.e., focused students who are serious about contributing--don't take this course. Take a higher level, even if you don't think your language skills are up to par. On the other hand, if you'd like a gentle continuation of Spanish in a relaxed, low-stress atmosphere, I fully recommend it.","You should take it if you are trying to improve your Spanish.","This is helpful to the development of your language skills and its great to learn about the Spanish\/Latin American culture.","I would tell future students that Spanish 30 is a very engaging class in terms of the ways it presents students to different cultural values and perspectives in the Hispanic world.  It teaches not just about the literature and history of this world, but also about its culture and values in a unique and informative way.","I would tell future students that this class is highly enjoyable and interactive. You learn a lot and improve both your oral and writing skills. Communication is enhanced and you get closer with your classmates.","Great way to refresh your Spanish before a summer or semester abroad in a Spanish-speaking country. Interesting insights into culture and literature as well.","This is a really intersting class. If you're sick of just learning Spanish grammar and are thinking of dropping the language, I would suggest shopping Spanish 30 first. The texts and the focuses on four Spanish-speaking cultures makes this class much more engaging.","Participation is important.","Great class, my best Spanish class so far.","it is a good review if you do not feel ready to take a higher level course.","Spanish 30 is a good review of grammar that isn't tedious at all because it's incorporated into the works and movies that we read and watch. The readings were enjoyable for the most part.","This class was a big step up in workload from Spanish C and other lower level Spanish classes","it all depends on the tf you get","TAKE IT!","Fun course to practice writing, reading and oral skills. Interesting topics, good readings.","Great class with great professors, and your Spanish speaking, reading, and writing skills will improve tremendously.","I would tell them that there is a lot of regular work, but I feel like my spanish improved a lot.  I also would tell them that especially for this course you will only get out of it what you put into it.","The readings are a bit difficult to understand but the workload is not that bad.","participate in class often","Basically same class as spanish c, but a little bit harder with more readings and they expect you to know more.","Improves your Spanish and increases cultural vocabulary and knowledge of the different debates in the Hispanic world.","Buena suerte!","How much you like it all depends on your teacher."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Take advantage of the class by participating as much as possible and doing the assignments to the best of your ability.","Be prepared to learn grammar on your own.  If you're looking to become more proficient in Spanish, this may not be the class to take.\r\nHowever, if you like Spanish literature, this is a good class.","This course is really good exposure to spanish literature and culture. It really helps with comprehension, but assumes knowledge of most grammar and does not emphasize speaking.","It's a good Spanish class that studies interesting works of Spanish literature while also keeping up a solid foundation of grammar and vocabulary.","Great way to learn Spanish.  One of the more enjoyable classes I've taken.","It is a great class and the workload is a reasonable amount.","If you like Spanish and are considering a citation, take this class and the decision will be easy.  This class relies on you to prepare. You will learn if you do or done but like most classes you get what you put into it.  Plus if you love language and culture this is a class to take.","There is a lot of reading. Class discussions are focused around novels and short stories read outside of class.","This is a really great class! The readings, art, and movies we studied were really fascinating.","Great Spanish review.","The course materials are really interesting (novels, short stories, poems, art), and the workload is very manageable. However, though it's easy to take this class (not too much work), it's hard to do really well because everything is graded based on nit-picky grammar. The instructor was not very helpful in explaining why something is incorrect but rather just says that it is incorrect.. perhaps office hours would help, but as with all languages, it's tricky because there are things you just wouldn't know if you weren't a native. The problem is that they never teach it (they only review basic grammar and don't ever go into special or difficult cases) and your grades suffer because of it.","This course was a good review for students of Spanish in term of grammar. I think my writing improved a lot as well. Great class for anyone who wants to have a more solid command of the language. The readings were pretty interesting as well.","I really enjoyed this class and all that it had to offer, including the literature, poetry, filmography, and cultural history that was taught.","This class is a straightforward way to read interesting texts and develop one's Spanish.  Expectations are clear - you write four essays, and there are three exams and a final.","Talk to your TF about your essays, as they are the most difficult (but most rewarding) aspect of the course and you will get a lot out of discussing them with him or her.","It's easy and relaxing. It was refreshing to just casually discuss arts and literature for an hour three times a week.","keep up with grammar work","This class has a considerable amount of reading, but is a great way to improve your spanish and learn about the culture of different countries.","Fun class with not too much work involved (of course, provided that your previous knowledge of Spanish is ok). Juan is an awesome TF: funny, nice, smart and helpful.","Come to class prepared for discussion.  When the section as a whole is prepared, it's a lot of fun!","Ines is a great teacher.","It's a really good class--take advantage of the small size!","Very engaging and useful course.","Fun review of Spanish","The grade is pretty subjective in this class, so if you don't like your TF, make the switch quick.","Not necessary to do any real work...","there is a lot fo busy work but its a fun class","This class is wonderful. You learn so much in such a short period of time. You also learn to appreciate literature.","This is a great class!  I loved it, and it really improved my spanish skills.","This section was a pretty big jump in difficulty from Spanish C.","Make sure you get a good TF!","If you're looking for a stimulating Spanish experience, this is a great class to take.  You'll learn a lot not just about the language, but about Spanish culture around the world and throughout history.","If you already have a strong background in Spanish you should probably take 40 and not 30. But Spanish 30 is very similar to AP Spanish Literature.","great class","This was an interesting class, however it did require continual work.","This class is perfect for students who have taken Spanish at college or in high school but aren't comfortable with their speaking or writing skills. Don't expect to be coddled through grammar, but if you have already learned the basics of the Spanish language this is a great way to practice and refine your skills.","I think the class is really interesting and one will learn about significant poets, artist, writers of the time period and country you are studying.  If you are not into art or literature you may want to pass.  The emphasis is more on the content then being able to express yourself in spanish.","This is a fun, painless class that will greatly improve your Spanish. If that's what your looking for, you won't find a better class.","This course is great, but I guess it depends on your TF.  This course improves your ability to read and speak in Spanish.  There is not a lot of focus on grammar (though there is a lot of grammar on the final exam)","This course is what you expect, or at least what I expected. It won't be the reason you came to Harvard, but it can be a good, fun class to take.","This is a great class. Not that hard, but interesting and a change of pace from other academic classes.","The Spanish classes at Harvard are excellent and this class is no different. The instructors are always enthusiastic and make section fun and interesting.","If you have a good TF, your experience in this course will be wonderful.  It has made me a much more confident Spanish speaker and writer, and I finally feel that I am starting to be able to analyze Spanish literature at an academic level.

I have really learned to appreciate the cultures of many Spanish speaking countries as well.","Interesting, fun, fairly easy","Painless class. You learn a lot. Take it.","Take it!  It is pretty easy and very interesting.  You get out as much as you put in.  4 compositions and 4 exams (including final) so not that bad.  Also, depends on your TF and class.

I would recommend it with enthusiasm.","This class is so much fun! It's not too taxing and you still feel like you learn a lot. The stories and movies we watched were fascinating, and gave me greater insight into the different cultures of different regions in Latin America. Make sure you get a good TF (Martha is the best!!

She is also very accessible outside of class), and you get out what you put into it.","A very fun and interesting way to learn about different Spanish-speaking countries (both history and culture) as well as improve your Spanish-speaking abilities.","If you want to improve your grammatical skills, you'll need to put in additional work outside of homework and class time.","It feels very much like a high school course in the way it is taught and the assignments you are given.","It's not too hard and is pretty fun","I loved the way different types of media were used to introduce us to many latin american cultures. I was fascinated.","Please take this class with Martha! She is an absolute doll and makes the class very worthwhile. It will be the class that you look forward to every week. She really helps with language confidence too by just being very accepting and gentle when you are hesitant to speak.","If you're interested in spanish, you should take the course!

So much fun!  Interesting material and not too intense with daily work; however I've heard this depends on your TF.  I really feel like I learned a lot!","This class is a great class. It is very interesting to view more cultural aspects of Spanish speaking nations. However, it is a lot of reading and writing in Spanish, which are both pretty time consuming, and it does not focus on learning new vocabulary and grammar to help with reading and writing. If you're looking for a culture class, this is a great one to start with, but if you're just looking to learn the language, then this course is not for you.","This class is a great ease in to languages at harvard, because it shares a lot in common with AP Spanish Language. A word of caution, however: If you are aiming for a secondary in Spanish, take Spanish 40 instead because 30 doesn't count towards secondary requirements for Spanish. Also, the TF you have has a huge influence on your enjoyment of the class: I originally had the course head Senora Daamgard as my TF and she is amazing--very engaging and easily makes the language come alive, as well as very approachable. But when I was switched into a different section, headed by Senora Uriostegui Carlos, Spanish became very pedantic and dry--she is no where near as engaging as Senora Daamgard and for a while I did not enjoy the prospect of going to Spanish every MWF. However, overall, good course.","All I can really talk about is my section, and I really really enjoyed going to spanish.","Fun class. If you have a background in Spanish from past courses in high school and from Harvard you can do very well.","if you speak spanish and know your stuff, you dont have to put in much work and the class is fairly easy.","The workload will vary fairly dramatically; most nights there is almost no homework, but when reading novels (this only happens twice during the semester), the nightly reading assignments will be considerably longer.","This class will help your Spanish, but it will demand attention outside of class.","This class enhanced my speaking abilities and reinforced particular grammatical concepts in Spanish.  It was exciting and inspired an enthusiasm for the language.","this will help you become a better spanish writer...and you'll learn more about latin america","Similar to a high school language class: the class is small and well taught, but we never seemed to cover the material too comprehensively.","It is a lot of fun and the readings are interesting.","A great class to fine tune Spanish skills while learning about Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Chile.","Make sure you read all the short story\/book assignments in time and participate actively in class discussions.","This is a great class, and Johanna makes it very engaging and fun. She's a great, kind-hearted teacher and made it a pleasure to take this class.","This class is a lot of fun and it's easy to get an A without putting in much effort, but if you take the time to really work at the language and participate in discussions you will get a lot more out of it.","While the graded assignments aren't too difficult, the homework is quite tedious and annoying.","This class is very upbeat and the teachers are awesome.

Engage in the discussions and your Spanish will get incredibly better!  Coming out of this class, you will be able to understand the gist of pretty much any Spanish conversation.  This is a great introduction to spoken Spanish and a great first step to getting a citation.","This class was probably my favorite of the four I took in my first semester. Ana Yanez definitely had a lot to do with that, but the sheer variety of materials and subject matter covered, as well as the breadth of conversations simply made every class fun and unpredictable. Also, Ana was a bit of a comedian, making it rewarding to pay attention in class. Finally, the class helped my conversational and written Spanish immensely, as well as augmented my ability to listen and comprehend Spanish.","A great, basic intermediate Spanish class.  Highly recommended! Johanna is the best!","If you can, take this class as an elective!  It is a low stress class that teaches you a lot.","It's a helpful class and the work is not too hard.","This is a good class, but it is imperative to stay organized and participate.","It's a fun class and a unique and beneficial class environment, but it can be frustrating at times.","It's a good class for intermediate Spanish students who feel the need to improve their grammar and reading comprehension skills.","This class is really fun, and it's a nice way to round out a schedule.","This class is great if you want to get a strong foundation in grammar and writing skills for later improving your Spanish speaking skills. Johanna Liander is a great professor and extremely engaged with the students. I definitely recommend this course!","I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wishes to become fluent in the language.  The assignments are manageable, the class discussions are challenging yet fun, and Ines is a wonderful section leader who is clearly passionate about imparting her knowledge of the language to her students.  If the readings ever seem difficult, just remember how many years of reading and speaking it took to become proficient at any other language you speak, and the work won't seem so bad.","This class has a relatively light work load for a language course, but there's still work every day. I enjoyed the two books we read and the different countries we studied were fascinating. My TF spoke Mexican Spanish (which is what I've learned) so that was nice.","Take advantage of the seminar setting and speak up in class. It's a little daunting to speak spanish to a native speaker if you've never been in that situation before, but all the other students in the class are right there with you.

We had the other teachers as substitutes a few times and she is definitely the best one! She is really engaging and makes class relaxed but useful and effective.","Spanish 30 is a fun and painless way to improve your writing and speaking skills in an intimate setting with an experienced instructor. Culture and literature are presented and are integral to the course.

Some assignments, like watching certain movies, seem extraneous and not necessary to the fundamentals of learning.","this is a wonderful class for those who passed spanish C COMFORTABLY.","It really enhances your enjoyment of the class if you know the grammar which is very well done in Spanish C if you need to brush up on it. They will teach you grammar in 30 but it helps a lot if you already know it","Great class","Take Spanish 30. The teachers are fantastic, and the class is extremely rewarding!","The class is great! Easy if you've taken Spanish C or did pretty well on the AP\/subject test","This class is a great way to learn Spanish without all the painful grammar exercises and things like that.

The material is all very interesting, and I hardly realized I was improving my speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills while taking this class.","Make sure you get a good TF!","I learned this stuff in high school as a junior and then senior; if you took Spanish in high school and didn't test out, do not worry, this class is ridiculously easy. I studied a total of five minutes per test, and it worked.","Stay on top of your work and you'll do fine (basically, just do the readings and worksheets--they aren't long or prohibitively difficult). Fall behind, and the amount of work you're supposed to do could bury you.","Great class.","Great class for those looking to broaden their spanish horizons without too much of a challenge.

She had a great personality and made the class really feel welcome. The class was pretty good, too, but it did take a lot of out-of-class time to watch the required movies.","Ballesteros was amazing! I learned so much Spanish and I feel that my speaking really improved.","You won't get a ton of new vocab and grammar, but you'll get a refresher course in a low-stress setting.","If you want to learn spanish with friendly TFs, relaxed environmnent yet engaging class materials and discussions, this is your catch!!!","This is a great course and I highly recommend taking it but only take it if you want to pursue a citation, don't use it to meet the language requirement.","It's not too much work and it's a good course to help you work on and not forget your spanish too much. Obviously it's not an intense course, so your spanish won't improve tremendously.","only take it if you are highly interested in learning about spanish language or culture.","The assignments are confusing, and sometimes emailed 12 hours before class (8 of which you'll optimistically be sleeping).  Movies creep up on you - budget time based on syllabus.  Try to participate!","Make sure you try to get Maye as a TF. She made the course.","This course was notably different from Spanish courses that I have taken before.  While it still focuses on the basics of Spanish grammar, it also provides a good background in the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries.  The course materials are good, the readings are very interesting, and the course is a great help in expanding and perfecting your grasp of the language.","It is a fairly easy class. There is a consistent amount of homework, but it doesn't take long.","The professors really care about their students and want them to learn the language. In order to do this they are very understanding and willing to work with kids outside of class to get them on top of things.","This class is very similar to Spanish C, in fact one of the reading materials is identical.","You're either gonna take more Spanish or you're not. If you are, take this class.","This is the best spanish class I have ever taken. Professor Liander is hilarious and will make your experience incredible.","Do the readings to promote better discussions!","As with the other Spanish classes, this class is fun, and you learn a lot more than you realize.","Language classes at Harvard are great.  They are challenging but manageable and you will get out of it as much as you put into it.  But if you are not passionate about language and don't have to take one, don't take it because you have to put in time to improve.  You could probably survive with little effort but you won't benefit from the class.","The course is more like an in between course. It doesn't really help you with your reading and it doesn't really help you develop your speaking. It's more like reinforcing material you already know. If you want an easy A, go for it.","This class is a fun and stress-free way to improve your Spanish!  Take it if you want your grammar, reading, and writing skills to improve.  The workload is very manageable, but if you put in a little bit more than is needed, you'll really get a lot out of class.","This class can be easier or difficult depending on who you have as a TF. I have never had to invest as much effort preparing for a language class as I did this year because I have the head TF. However, if you have anyone else, it should be a good way to have a TON of fun with not as much work as some other courses.","Do the readings!!","practice speaking as much as you can!","This is an amazing course taught by amazing TFs.  If you want to continue your Spanish knowledge and expand your language competency than this is an excellent course to take.","This class is the best structured of the Spanish classes that I have taken at Harvard - far and away better than Spanish C.","it's a lot of material and work and the students set the bar high","This class really improves your grammar skills and has some excellent movies.","Make sure you do the grammar practices and really try to participate in class!","In almost every way, this is like a high school class. The workload and work pacing is like high school; the classroom experience is like high school; the assignments and tests are like high school. If that appeals to you, go for it. If not, I'd look elsewhere. Also, this is not a course for learning Spanish grammar--it's horrible for that. It's best used as a way to force yourself to start reading, writing, and speaking Spanish more.","It's a shame you won't speak more Spanish.","Great class which is fairly easy.","Great class, good texts and films. Not too difficult, easy to handle.","The workload isn't too bad, and the material is interesting.  The teachers are awesome and even if some of the readings are tough, none are too long and you discuss everything in class.","not too bad for a language class","Only take this class if you want a Spanish citation.  If I wasn't aiming for that goal, I would have dropped it the first week.","Makes for some great advancement in your Spanish.","The TFs for this course are awesome.  It is a very easy course and a great way to continue practicing Spanish.","A huge help in improving Spanish speaking and writing.","very good take if your interested in latin american countries","Great class, great focus on culture, especially Cuba.","It is such a wonderful class. Entirely painless and you actually learn something!","I found significant overlap between Spanish C and 30. If you have taken an intermediate or advanced level Spanish course before, I would consider jumping to Spanish 40.","This course does not do a very good job of improving one's reading, writing or grammar. For me, I learned very little.","An excellent course! Prof. Liander runs the course very well, and is a superb teacher. The material is diverse and intriguing. You learn as much, if not more, about culture than about the language itself, which keeps the course and the applications of the language fun and interesting! A background in the grammar is nice, so that you're reviewing or solidifying some concepts instead of learning all of them for the first time, and some experience (although much isn't necessary) reading Spanish literature or watching Spanish film is a plus.","It's fun!","I didn't feel like I learned much, but it is required for the citation. The learning for this course is much more on the student than the teacher."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Great class. Nice break from a crazy schedule.","Si entiendas lo que estoy diciendo, est\u00c3\u00a1s listo\/a para tomar espa\u00c3\u00b1ol 30.","highly recommended","This is a good class to take if you are interested in earning a language citation or just want to further your skills in Spanish. The course is similar to Spanish C, but places a lot of emphasis on literature. The workload is fair and you will enjoy this class. Just be prepared to stay on top of the readings and come to class prepared to discuss the materials each and every day.","It really depends on your TF. My TF was fantastic. Others I heard would take up the homework and grade it and it became more of a struggle between the students and the TF.","It is a great moderate-level Spanish course, and essential for anyone who wants to become fluent in the language.","Goretti is the best Spanish 30 teacher, we had substitutes and none were as great as she is!","This course is great for anyone who is easing back into Spanish if you have not taken it very recently. It is also good for anyone who has taken Spanish recently but wants to review the basics before jumping into harder literature.","Eugenio is so helpful and animated. The material is especially engaging as well especially the 2 novels and the movie Machuca.","It is a good solid, Spanish class.  Not too much work.  Get Johanna.","Exams are not that difficult, but you need to put in a fair amount of work to understand the readings and do well on the written assignments. The class focuses more on culture than grammar. My instructor Eugenio Lanzas was awesome.","Good course to take to get a Spanish citation","If you are unsure whether to take this course or Spanish C, I encourage you to go for Spanish 30.  The first couple weeks may be difficult as you get used to a Spanish-only classroom setting, but it gets easier quickly and covers more interesting material than Spanish C.","Spanish 30 was a fun course that helped improve my understanding of Latin American culture.","this class really isn't worth your time.  I felt like my Spanish didn't really improve since we spent almost no time on grammar, and there was A LOT of busy work.  It's also unfortunate that the class was changed to be 4 days\/week instead of 3 like in the past.  For what should be a fun and easy class, I found Spanish 30 to be pretty difficult because of a lack of teaching in section and stressful because of the large amount of small assignments","Moves at a surprisingly fast clip but you learn a lot about not only the Spanish language but Latin American culture as well.","If you are good at reading and speaking Spanish, this class will be really easy. The tests are pretty easy, but there is a lot of work. You have homework every night and sometimes the reading assignments are fairly long and hard to get done if you are not good at reading spanish quickly.","If you want to brush up on basic Spanish grammar, this is a great class.","Great class. A lot of fun, though sometimes the readings can be pretty time-consuming.","A fun class, Maria Jose is great","Great course.","This is a great class, especially if you are looking for an easier 4th\/5th class.  The professors are very enthusiastic and accessible.  Definitely take and go to the Spanish tables!","Take this class","You have to know a lot about grammar and be willing to put a lot of time into learning by yourself.","Don't be shy! Use this course to really improve your speaking skills.","This course requires that you really take essays and exams seriously, but the discussion part of the course is laid-back and engaging.","Such a nice break from large lecture classes. You get to know your classmates really well and it's a really great environment.","Great class, not too stressful or hard.","It helped my Spanish speaking skills immensely.","So fun! Looked forward to class and enjoyed the readings and film.","Be prepared to speak and write!","This class is a great, low-stress class, that goes well with other harder classes.","This class is nice if you want a bit of a grammar review and a better foundation before moving onward with your Spanish experience! You still learn so much, and become much more comfortable with using the language!","Spanish 30 briefly touches on all important grammar but does not go incredibly in depth or do it comprehensively. It is a very fun class that does not take too much work and makes the curriculum interesting by weaving in cultural learning as well.","You learn all about different Latin American and South American cultures through literature, music and food.","Office hours are incredibly helpful! Go seek individual sessions with the professor or TF, because that is extra time to practice your speaking skills.","Don't take this class to learn grammar. All the grammar will be reviewed, but it goes quickly and will be very difficult if the grammar has not been learned before. It is a language and culture review class. This title is accurate. However, it is really fun and Maria is super nice!","Very fun class to take! It was fairly easy, as most of the work was done in class. My TF was really nice and encouraged us to feel comfortable speaking Spanish. In class activities are always easy and fun and just encourage you to speak in Spanish. It definitely helped me improve my listening and speaking skills more so than grammar and vocabulary. Also you receive a better understanding of history, culture, music, and literature in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile in a fun way.","This is a great class!  It really helps you to become more comfortable with reading and writing in Spanish.  Some of the course materials, however, (the novels) are a bit too above the level of this course, and they take quite a bit of time to get through (which is especially difficult because this class meets four days per week).","The Spanish department is very good.","The class really helps to improve your spanish, and it's nice to have a small class in section format. You get pretty close to your peers and you spend a lot of time talking about the four different countries the course focuses on (Peru, Chile, Mexico and Colombia). The homework is every night and you have to stay on top of the reading, a lot of which is an exercise of trying to understand what's happening overall without being able to understand every word and the assignments are frequent though not particularly difficult.","This class was awesome! I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. Not too time intensive.","You want Gorretti! She was a great teacher and makes learning Spanish fun.","TAKE IT!","The course is great and Profesora really wants to help you improve your spanish, so take advantage of her provided opportunities.","The class can be tedious sometimes but if you're serious about polishing your Spanish skills, then this class will definitely aid you.","Really not hard, you should be able to get an A in this class fairly easily and still learn a lot of Spanish. Good class, I was satisfied with it","In total, Spanish 30 is a strong course. Keep in mind that this course will demand a lot of you (nightly homework, frequent exams, compositions and their revisions, etc.). Fortunately, most of the work is graded leniently, though I often felt that the grading around compositions was somewhat arbitrary\/confusing.","This class is relatively simple, but does require outside work in order to do well. Also, the section can feel very much like a high school course, and the assignments can feel pointless.","This course was different from high school Spanish courses I took, in that all classes were conducted in Spanish, forcing me to become comfortable with hearing and speaking the language, rather than simply reading and writing it. This is a good course to take if you want to immerse yourself in the language.","Great way to improve your spanish and to get some interesting insights into latinamerican cultures.","This class is not a lot of work but yet your Spanish speaking skills improve immensely.  Your experience is highly dependent upon your TF.  Mine happened to be great :)","I loved Spanish 30. The subject matter is all about culture and it was great to learn about various Latin American countries and their music, movies, food, artists, and customs.","As long as you get a good TF, you will love it! Mine was fabulous!","It is as much work as you put into it.","Take this class seriously. It is easy to put language classes on the back burner, especially if they review a lot, like in this course. However, if you do not put anything into it you will find yourself leaving the class the same way you came it, which is certainly not satisfying. This happened to me.","This class is great review for those who have a semi-strong background in spanish. You'll get more out of it if you put more work into it, so when you do the readings, try to look up the definitions for words you don't know- it'll come in handy for increasing your vocabulary. The speaking portions of the class will make a big difference in your speaking ability before and after taking the class, and it will be noticeable.","To truly enjoy this class, I think that you need to have a strong interest in both learning the Spanish language, and especially learning the culture of various Latin American countries.  Language classes are a lot of work, and this class is NOT an exception to that rule so if you would like to take Spanish 30, consider the time and effort that you would have to put into it.","This was a great class in that it provided a great review of all the grammar I had seen previously and introduced new concepts while covering interesting material.","Very chill class that is fun and relaxing.  Plus, you learn a lot of cultural stuff.","This class is a great way to improve your spanish, especially if you have not been speaking spanish for an extended period of time. The class is taught in small sections, which really enhances the learning experiences and allows you to receive personal feedback.","This class can be as helpful as you want it to be. Honestly, you could probably sit through this class and not participate (at least in my section), and probably pass it without even doing the readings, as a result of the in-depth discussion that you don't even need to participate in. But at the end of the semester you will regret it. You won't have learned anything. Instead, actually seek out your instructor during his or her office hours and chat. It will help improve your Spanish tremendously.","The format is highly conducive to gaining fluency in Spanish - you get to speak it every day, which helps tremendously.  You also get better at editing your work and catching grammatical errors in your writing because you turn in multiple drafts of papers. I'm sure the quality of the course depends on your instructor, but you will almost definitely get noticeably better at Spanish if you take Spanish 30.","It's a really standard Spanish class like in high school, but with more enjoyable cultural readings and listenings. The course staff is great."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Experience depends on instructor.  If you do your work each day and come prepared it makes class a lot more fun and allows for better discussions.","It is fairly similar to Spanish C but I especially liked the smaller class size that I had in my section. Maye is very nice and willing to help. It doesn't require too much work and will fulfill the language requirement\/citation without adding too much stress on to your workload.","This language class was a lot more work than Spanish As, Ab, and C, so be prepared to work  a lot more than what you were used to in the previous Spanish classes at Harvard.","The course was pretty good, and it certainly improved my Spanish.  However, there was not a huge difference between Spanish C and Spanish 30.  If you want more of an in-depth grammar review, take Spanish C, but if you just want a quick overview, take Spanish 30.  The content covered in Spanish 30 is a lot more interesting, though.","It was relatively stress less class. If you pay attention and do the reading, it should be enjoyable and you really should get something out of it in terms of learning and enjoying spanish.","This is a great class for those who want to continue to refine their spanish skills. This class design is very similar to Spanish C, however we watch more movies and have more open class discussion.","It's a fun class, the workload isn't too bad and the teacher was good.","Get Eugenio as a teacher!","This is a great class to improve your Spanish speaking skills and if you put in the effort, which includes no more than doing the required reading or watching the required films before class, then this will be an easy and enjoyable class.","This class requires some time, but it is not impossible. Having class 4 days a week actually decreases homework time.","It's fun and it gives you a nice little picture of several hispanic countries.","The class is great for students who speak some Spanish to shore up their speaking and writing before entering higher level Spanish classes.","just know that you will be made to talk in class","Easy and fun! Take it if you can!","If the level is appropriate for you, it's a good class.","I really enjoyed this class but I think you need to understand that you will get out of it as much as you put into it.  If you do the reading and participate, you will get better and have a better handle of the spanish language.  If you don't, you are just hurting yourself.  I think that Javier was a really good teacher and available for outside help when needed and that if you want to learn spanish better, you should take this course.","Your experience in the class depends a lot on TF you have.  Readings are difficult to get through, but we review them in class.  Good exposure to culture of various spanish speaking countries.","Very straightforward. Good grades possible with studying.","it all depends on your section leader","Very easy, but also boringly easy.","Great class to take.","It should have been an easier course, but I was lazy in the class. If you do all the work it'll be very rewarding. Don't fall into a trap of blowing off the homework.","Eugenio is an incredible & interesting person, take the time to get to know him.","Eugenio is awesome! The course is great for those who want to review their Spanish and get started on more advanced learning","It's a very good advanced language review.  It was perfect for remembering my Spanish prior to traveling to South America.","It is a lot of work. Every week there is something due. But the classes are fun and interesting if you get a good teacher like Javier.","fun, comfortable class. lots of assignments but they dont take much out of you.  the instructor was very understanding and easy to talk to - really wanted the best for each student.","This class teaches you spanish through a cultural lens. By learning about different cultures across the Latin world you gain a deeper appreciation and knowledge about both the culture and language itself. Because of the movies, books and pace of the class your speaking and understanding of the language will have increased exponentially.","This is an interesting course that really focuses on speaking spanish more than grammar. It reviews grammar but helps you to get better at understanding and communicating in spanish.","It's not easy but it's doable","Great, easy class. As long as you keep up with the work (which isn't too hard or too much, but does require daily work), you'll be in great shape.","Take it!","This class is relatively low stress, although try to do\/skim the poems and other readings to keep up with discussions and exercises (participation is a good chunk of the grade). It would also be useful to either meet with your section leader regularly or practice in language circles in other Houses, since you will not pick spanish up well if you do not practice speaking often.","This course is for advanced Spanish speakers, but it is not too much of a jump from Spanish C. The only difference is the difficulty of the readings and films. Overall, it is entertaining and informative.","It is awesome. Fun and entertaining.","This class is fun and a great way to improve speaking skills because it is a speaking intensive course.","This class is great IF you get the right TF. Eugenio is WONDERFUL! Take it with him -- he's super chill, will grant you extensions, and doesnt care much about anything, except his students!!! He's great. You will learn a lot and get good practice. Can be dry at times, but its still worth it.","This class is great to enhance your grammatical skills, but has quite a bit of reading materials.","Just keep up with the readings and you should be fine.  Not a hard class at all.","IT'S SO EASY. A wonderful grade booster. Seriously take it!!! Make sure you get a good TF though, so feel free to switch sections. Literally spent 30 minutes per week doing homework\/studying\/essay writing outside of class.","Language classes are awesome! Take them!","This course is great. It will really improve your spanish without being too difficult.","Favorite class, but grammar is not a main focus, so it moves fast, it is good to have a solid background","I learned SO much from this class. My spanish has improved so much this year.","This class is a good grammar review and has some interesting readings and films. The countries we cover are great, and I definitely learned some history throughout the class. Some of the materials are a bit advanced vocabulary-wise, but it's not too difficult.","Your benefits from this course, as with all courses, purely depends on your TF. If I had known my TF ahead of time, I would have left this course instantly. Biggest regret of my semester.","This is a great class to review grammar, learn about different cultures, and watch some fun movies in Spanish."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["super fun, nice change of pace, stress-free!","It's great for an introduction to speaking, but not very intense if you want to be challenged to speak  on your feet.  It's really helpful if you need to brush up on grammer - but if you have little grammar background you might be lost.","It's basically the same thing as Spanish C, but with a novel component.","The course material is very interesting and class is always engaging.","This class isn't an \"easy, fun Spanish class.\" At least pick your TF wisely, make sure that you get along with them well from the start, if not, switch sections. It is vital that you like your TF ; it will only make the class miserable if you don't. Print out all the assignments for the semester the first day of class and make a binder so you don't have to worry about printing them out every week.","this class is a ton of fun. It does require a great amount of work but it is worth it","The most enjoyable Spanish class I have taken.","\u00c2\u00a1Aprended vuestro subjuntivo bien!","If you really want to learn how to speak Spanish more effectively, then definitely read the assigned grammar lessons so that you can understand it. We didn't really cover that much grammar in class. However, you can get without heavily studying grammar.","If you have Mar\u00c3\u00ada Jos\u00c3\u00a9 as an instructor, be sure to participate and you will have a great time","Spanish 30 covers interesting material from different Latin American countries and covers basic grammar, I definitely recommend this course!","If you happen to have a great instructor, the course is really worth taking.","Very easy. Almost all review of AP Spanish Language.","Take Javier!  He's great and really flexible if you don't end up getting your work done.  This course helped to improve my spanish a lot; speaking, writing, and reading.","Take this course if you are confident in your Spanish ability and are a good reader, speaker, understander and write. If you aren't able to speak\/write\/read well then it will be difficult and confusing","Review your tenses beforehand, they go over it pretty fast. I would recommend doing excercises with conjugations online at night, because the nightly homework is interesting but isn't great at reinforcing conjugation rules.","Daily homework feels quite tedious.","Take this class if you want to continue with Spanish and it is what you are placed in, but if you are just taking it to fill a fourth class that has a lower workload, you will probably be frustrated with the  structure of the class, which is very similar to high school. Also, you will not be forced to improve, so if you do not want to put in the extra work, you might be wasting your time.","It's a fun course with not much time commitment.","As long as you keep up with the homework, you will be adequately prepared for the exam materials. Make sure proper time is spent on the papers.","It is a fun class, but it meets every week so it is a good chunk of your class schedule.  Homework is not too bad, but it is every day so just be prepared for that.  If you pay attention to the material during the unit, you won't have to cram and it will be a lot easier to be prepared for the exams.","You take out what you put in.","Compared to high-school, the amount of reading initially seems overwhelming, but after a few weeks it becomes easier. Prisca is the best!","As long as you keep on top of your work, you will get a good grade.","It's great if you want to expand your understanding of Latin American culture.","Great class, helps to improve your Spanish through daily discussions.","Students should be prepared to read a lot","This course does an excellent job of improving basic language and writing skills with teaching about culture in the highlighted countries. I had four years of high school Spanish, and felt that this course was the right place for me.","This class is difficult, but interesting!  In general, be wary in language classes!  People take them who are far too advanced for the level, and that makes it more challenging for the rest of us.","Do the readings. It makes the class so much more interesting. And try to participate in class no matter how intimidating it might seem.","This class is a great way to become acquainted with Latin American culture while practicing your language skills.","If you liked high school style language courses you will be right at home.","Easy, painless class, except the homework can become tedious at times.","I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot about Latin American culture.","This is a great fourth class to balance your schedule. Johanna is the best! Not much work at all, and the Spanish content is extremely easy. This course is better and easier than Spanish C.","This class is perfect if you got a 4 on the AP Spanish exam. It goes over a grammar topic everyday (Which may seem rushed, but really is all you need!) Also, the fact that you get to revise your compositions really helps you become better at Spanish overall.","This class is a great way to improve your speaking spanish.  It is not very hard but if you do the coursework you will read some great spanish literature and learn very interesting things about the countries you study.  That said you get out as much as you put in.  If you do not do the readings (and it is easy to neglect them and get by in class) or if you do not speak up in class, your spanish will not improve.  But if you actively participate spanish 30 is awesome.","It is a good class, but it depends on which section leader you receive.","I would tell them that this course is a really fun and relaxed way to become familiar with Latin American writers, painters, and singers. It is also a great way to develop your speaking and written Spanish. However, it does require a certain degree of work on a pretty much daily basis.","This was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. My TF was so sweet, and I learned a lot about a variety of Latin American countries.","This course is a very speedy review of grammar, so there is a lot of work! You know how to speak a lot better Spanish by the end of the semester though.","As with all language course, you will get out what you put into it.","This was the first Spanish class that I actually enjoyed. Professor Liander and the materials were great.","This is a great class to continue your spanish learning, or if you are a little out of practice. It is usually a small class of about 10 students, so you get to speak a lot in a very comfortable environment.","I would recomend that if you haven't taken spanish in a while start with C. 30 moves much faster with less review. Still its really fun :)","The class is very fair. Make sure to practice what you learn in class in every day or you will get lost behind in course material and have a tough time catching up.","This class made me feel a lot more comfortable with my Spanish conversation skills in addition to analyzing texts in a foreign language.","It's a great review of all the grammar you've probably already learned plus more that you probably have not. The classes are more intimate and this makes it easier to participate. The course materials will help strengthen your reading abilities and mandatory talking in spanish will make you more comfortable with speaking.","This Spanish class is very well taught and exposes you to a lot of interesting material and ideas giving you the chance to really learn about latin american culture in a meaningful way. My spanish certainly improved through this class as it was an awesome opportunity to speak only spanish. Even though the class was wonderful, for me, speaking spanish for one hour four times a week didn't feel fulfilling. At this level to really improve my spanish, I felt like I needed to be completely immersed in it. For this reason, I would advise considering what you're language goals are before deciding if you want to take this language class or get your Spanish experience through some other avenue (ie. summer program, abroad experience, etc).","Great class. Whats annoying is how there is no good syllabus to follow\/it is always changing. Just know that its hard to plan ahead for this class. You're going to have homework for the next day everyday, but theres no way to plan ahead because the hw is not on a syllabus.","This is a fantastic course, and Johanna Liander is a wonderful teacher. You will get extensive language review and you'll learn so much about the Latin American culture. It was so interesting to explore art, music, film, literature, and cuisine from various Latin American countries. It was a great class, definitely take it!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Spanish 30 is a course where you have the opportunity to challenge your existing language skills and learn about hispanic culture from various mediums: academic writing, creative writing, documentaries, films, and music.","This class is pretty much the same as C, though the review is slightly quicker and there is more reading involved.","My TF was wonderful! The class had a great balance of material so you learn Spanish through one book, various movies, a guest singer, music, student presentations (with perhaps a salsa lesson). The people in my section happened to be awesome and learning Spanish in such a small size (maybe 15 people) was great. You only speak in Spanish, no English, and it is a lot of grammar, but the practice of grammar done in class helps a lot and they are practical on the exams.

If you can succeed in that class, you should be able to do similarly.","This class helped me review, improve, and further develop my skills in Spanish. By watching the films, reading the stories, and engaging with the material in class, I was able to practice reading, writing, and speaking. The class is, of course, what you make of it. If you want to get the most out of the class, fully immerse yourself into it: speak in class, watch movies without subtitles, practice with your grammar book, etc. While the work was at times boring and bothersome, this is a good class to take if you want to improve your skills in Spanish.","The course reviews all of Spanish grammar, exposes you to Spanish literature, teaches you about the cultures of four Spanish-speaking countries, and helps you practice speaking Spanish.","Get Rebeca if possible.","If you are interested in spanish don't be afraid to take this class. It is a fun class and not too much work.","Definitely a good course to take as a review of AP Spanish Language material, or as a next-step course. It was taught well and moved at a good pace.","In terms of fulfilling the language requirement, this course obviously does the job. It's fairly easy and can be pretty enjoyable depending upon which instructor you get.","Good class, not a great class.","The course offers and overview of spanish grammar starting with the past tense, making the class accesible even if your spanish is rusty and you need to be reminded of these easier tenses. The focus of the class is on 4 different countries and their culture during interesting times in their history which makes for an engaging focus besides mere grammar and language practice.","This was a great class! The tests were really fair as long as you paid attention in class and learned the grammar on your own, which the textbook is great for teaching, because I think it's pretty difficult to learn grammar during a lecture. There are a few take-home 2-page essays that are also very manageable. I felt like almost every assignment was useful and helped me engage with the texts\/language. My Spanish improved a lot.","This class is pretty easy, and its well taught. The structure of the curriculum is nice. There is not final exam. You finish early with your last test.","The strucutre of this course is awesome spanning different cultures and the different medias you study from short novels to stories to poems to film to music really allow you to understand the cultures of these nations. The structure of the course really helps you to improve in speaking requiring that you participate in discussion every day. i advise that the grammar will be more quickly glanced over and reviewed expecting that you are familiar with it so be sure you are familiar with all verb conjugations.","This course is very similar to Spanish C, just a bit harder in the sense that you are expected to know the grammar (it is not assigned in homework exercises or reviewed in class). The most interesting part of the class was the 4 countries style through which it is taught, but I don't feel like I came away a better spanish speaker or even reader\/writer. There is not much more speaking in class and there are the same style essays as Spanish C, so I didn't really find my spanish improving. However, there is room to learn a lot along the way about Mexico, Spain, Cuba, and Puerto Rico which makes the course a bit more fulfilling.","It's not bad. Maybe a little repetitive, but learning about Spanish culture is interesting!","Standard language class, with a fantastic professor. Painless way to go through intermediate Spanish.","The course is interesting-you talk about more than just grammar. The course materials will actually make you think and of course you improve your Spanish a lot.","Spanish 30 is a good mid\/upper level Spanish class. There is a full review of all grammar concepts, but you will be with students who are pretty good Spanish speakers. The content is interesting and my section was good.","Very similar to Spanish C. Readings are a bit more difficult (as expected), but all in all a good course.","This class is very well paced. It does review much of the grammar from Spanish C, but in an in-depth way that feels refreshing and not too redundant. The course assignments are very manageable. Speaking Spanish in the classroom was very helpful in allowing me to practice my Spanish in a conversational setting. The Spanish compositions assigned in the class were useful in assisting my improvement in Spanish writing. Overall, this class is a low-key setting to practice and hone your Spanish skills while learning many interesting things about different Spanish\/Latino cultures in the process and reading popular Spanish works. I would strongly recommend this class.","A really good way to work on grammar and reading in particular, and take you from intermediate to solidly advanced Spanish.  A big time commitment and quite a bit of reading, but overall very worthwhile.","The course was much more difficult than Spanish C","Hard to stay on top of things because you continuously have assignments but if you need to take spanish, not a bad option.","I mean if you want to learn spanish and you're at this particular level then yes absolutely.","The readings are interesting and the course material is engaging. The course does not spend much time on grammar and has a good deal of writing.","You're likely to get a great TF (most of them are fantastic in my experience), and it will make you happy that Harvard has a foreign language requirement.","Spanish 30 was, without a doubt, a great improvement to me over that of Spanish C. Spanish 30 was organized and thorough, and offered students the opportunity to learn in depth about four major countries in the Spanish speaking world. Though Spanish 30, I increased my confidence in my Spanish speaking skills and learned lots about Spanish culture. My advice to students considering this class would be to make sure to do the assignments and make sure to follow along with the grammar lessons as well to ensure that you are truly understanding these lessons.","Spanish 30 is a slightly challenging but worthwhile course.  The cultural and historical information taught in the class is quite interesting.","Loved it, fun materials and great class time!","Javier is a great spanish TF","Spanish 30 is great. The readings are pretty interesting, you get tons of opportunities to practice your spanish, and Carolina is the greatest. Had a blast and learned a lot.","Class will very depending on TF, do all the readings and you will be fine, brush up on grammar on your own.","Take the course, the TF's are really nice and helpful and the material is interesting and varied. The essay's are not difficult and the presentations aren't hard either","Very fun class with live music performances.","Take it if you want to get a citation or even get the one year requirement out of the way.","Spanish 30 was a great course, and my TF--Carolina--was fantastic! The workload is reasonable, and you really will improve your Spanish if you put time into the course.","Your experience in this really depends on your teacher and your classmates","This class is a good step to learning Spanish as there is even more focus on speaking than in Spanish C. If you are just trying to fill the language requirement, it may be a bit difficult.","Take your time on the readings and go to your TF's office hours to get the most out of the course.","awesome course. great way to learn spanish. not too much work but a lot of benefits--you come out knowing more spanish than when you went in.","It's great!","This is a great way to start your higher level Spanish learning. The class is fun, and you will learn to speak, read, and write better, at the same time as learning interesting information about Spanish culture in 4 very different Spanish-speaking nations (Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico).","You must take notes","Overall, this spanish course was fun and engaging. However, a lot of work and knowledge is expected out of you to really do well. With that said, the spanish department does a good job at making class interesting and learning about things that go beyond the spanish language.","I loved Spanish 30! There is a surprising amount of work, but it's just one of those things you have to grit your teeth and do. The readings, cultural components, and grammar bits were all great. Your experience will depend largely on your section leader, but if you happen to get Rebeca, she's awesome - super understanding, very supportive, and an overall great teacher.","I did not learn much Spanish.  The readings were fun and interesting, though.","Very fun and easy going class. You learn about different cultures and sharpen up grammar.","Spanish 30 is very similar to Spanish C but assumes greater knowledge of grammatical structures. Your experience in the course is almost entirely dependent upon your T.F.","This class is not very hard and it is a fun way to build on your spanish skills. The readings\/topics are pretty interesting as well.","Spanish is important to learn, this course does a good job at teaching your relative cultural information about several spanish speaking countries and their relations to the US","Only take this class if you have not taken Spanish C.","To stay on top of your work and pay attention to the finer details of grammar.","Not too much work but because it is daily you can't forget about doing your reading.","Take this class! It's a great way to hone your Spanish speaking skills","This is an incredible spanish class.  Not boring or repetitive at all.","..."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Luis is an excellent TF.  He is engaging and plans cultural events in class.  This class broadens your grammatical knowledge and begins to engage in text (short stories, poems, songs, and a novel).","This is an excellent language class if you're interested in continuing your studies of Spanish. I greatly improved my understanding of Spanish grammar (except, perhaps, for the subjunctive) and I know a lot more about the culture and history of Mexico, Peru, Colombia, and Chile. Ernesto does an excellent job and is concerned about his students. The grading is fair and the test material accurately reflects what the course teaches.","definitely take course. easy workload. rewarding readings and subject material. helpful if you put in effort.","This class is basically the same as Spanish C. You go over grammar and review quite a bit of cultural material. There's homework most nights, but not too much. Overall, a good way to add a fun class to your schedule while learning something.","Spanish 30 is a very good spanish course overall.  It can be challenging, but it is always fair.  Class discussion is excellent, the culture we study is interesting, and the instructors are patient and smart.","If you took Spanish throughout high school and are looking to continue, this class is very likely the one for you (and yes, I mean the shoddy high school education most of us get). It is conducted entirely in Spanish, and that may be slightly intimidating after a (probable) summer off, but don't worry, it only takes a couple days to get into it, so don't stop shopping it because of that.  Despite all the speaking, though, don't expect to come out of this class fluent or close to it-- you will learn\/review grammar for the most part.  If you want to be fluent, travel.  However, definitely take full advantage of all the little conversations we're supposed to have throughout the class, because if you do you'll notice your improvement, and if you don't, you won't.  Compared to other language classes, this one is easy (the longest assignment was 2 pages), so if you're considering taking it but aren't sure if you can spare the space, I give you a 90% guarantee you will be able to handle it no problem as an extra class.  Finally, it's extremely interesting learning about the different cultures-- so do it!","I absolutely loved this course! It's a great way to improve your written and spoken Spanish while studying four Spanish-speaking countries in depth.","Definitely worth taking for people who want to continue their studies of Spanish in college.","This is a fun course! You get to read a novel in spanish and watch a movie, which really helps improve your skills. Luis is AWESOME!!!! He's so nice, patient, and a great teacher. He doesn't make you feel pushed too much, but he still helps you learn a lot. You'll become a lot more comfortable speaking spanish and listening to spanish after this class.","Interesting, get out what you put in","Luis is such a sweetheart! Extremely approachable, personable and helpful. He made the class for me.","Good class but is entirely dependent on the TF you get. Reading is not entirely necessary, but the more you put into the class the more you get out of it. Should be an easy B+?A-","If you're feeling okay with grammar, take this class instead of Spanish C. I found that this class was much more interesting and unless you make huge errors in grammar Spanish 30 will help you correct those simple mistakes.","It doesn't focus on grammar or vocabulary, although both are needed to truly succeed in this course.  I felt that it was a course on four countries conducted in Spanish rather than a course intended to further my ability in Spanish.","it was really different (at least for me) from high school Spanish, so I had to make quite an adjustment. the class is reliant on participation and an understanding and ability to think critically (in Spanish) of readings and other homework materials.","This class is really good at getting you back into speaking and writing Spanish analytically if you have been out of practice for a few months.","Loved Spanish 30.  Typical language class that requires work and some time, but not unduly so.  Ernest was a GREAT TF.  Got to learn about 4 different Spanish countries and delve pretty deep into the grammar of Spanish.","Though the materials are a step up, Spanish 30 is a very similar difficulty level to Spanish C. Definitely more work than Aa or Ab but an enjoyable way in which to learn Spanish!","I think it is a good class to take in order to brush up on key grammar concepts in an interesting way.","The class requires a real time commitment and I am not sure that I improved my Spanish skills as much as I would have liked. On the other hand, the classes themselves were enjoyable and I really liked the TF for the course and the ways that she structured the class time.","Spanish 30 was such a fun class! You learn a lot about Mexican, Colombian, Peruvian, and Chilean culture through various types of media, such as literature, music, and movies. Also, Luis is an amazing instructor. He really cares about each and every student to make sure everyone is engaged in the language and the material.","A wonderful class to warm someone up to university-level language.","Fun cultural grounding in Hispanic art, music, short stories and some film with Spanish grammar review. Don't expect this to be an easy way to pick grammar back up after a break from Spanish, but you will get help if you ask for it.","This course is fun and make sure to take it with Luis if possible. He's so nice and funny and enthusiastic that it makes coming to class so much more worth it. Do the readings and such so you can participate instead of BSing. Enjoy!","Review the grammar, read all the assigned materials, participate, and be willing to make mistakes. This class is an important step in learning and internalizing the language. The lens of the four cultures is informative and keeps the discussions interesting.","I would recommend this course! We read interesting materials and the assignments are very manageable. Carolina is a great TF. You should have an interest in learning more about culture and history of Spanish-speaking countries as well as grammar (there is more of an emphasis on grammar than on vocabulary). Having taken Spanish C was helpful, but it's not necessary if you have a strong high school Spanish background.","This is an excellent course for further shaping spanish language skills, and the cultural material used (i.e. for literature and art analysis, music styles, food, ect) is fascinating! It is wonderful opportunity to learn more about four spanish speaking countries while improving speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills.","This course is good for increasing Spanish comprehension and introduces students to thinking in the language as opposed to translating.","The in class sections are great, but it takes a bunch of initiative to do the work outside of class when it is not mandatory.","Be prepared to speak Spanish.","This course really helped me with my Spanish.  If you have Carolina as a TF, she is WONDERFUL.  She's so much fun in class and she's very helpful when asked questions.  It was the first time I've been taught by a native speaker, which I felt did wonders.  Activities were easy if you did the readings and if you do the work, the tests are easy as well.  Take this class if you want to improve your Spanish!","This class, difficulty wise, was not too different from the previous Spanish courses offered at Harvard. It involves almost daily reading, but it is not overly time-consuming or difficult. The four tests are not very hard, and the topics are pretty interesting. I really enjoyed learning about 4 Spanish-speaking countries that are not the traditional ones taught in classes. My teacher was Maria, and she made the class amazing! She was so much fun and so nice! She really encouraged us to talk, and I believe she is the reason my Spanish improved as much as it did. I would love to have her as a teacher in the next Spanish class I take at Harvard.","It's a lot of fun and not too much work. Maria is great. I enjoyed having the chance to practice Spanish almost every day.","There are tons of resources to support you with this class. You get a lot out of section, but I wish I had pushed my speaking further with chats with my TF, the free language tutor center, or language tables.","It is a good class with interesting subject materiel, but do not take it if you are really interested in something else.","This was a great class. You will not really study anything new, it seems expected that you have seen all of the grammar already. Instead we spent a lot of time talking about the culture of different countries and had readings and exercises from the grammar book running continuously in the background.","I loved it!  Luis made the class very entertaining and fun!","Spanish 30 is very challenging and requires a strong understanding of the language, as you will be conversing about complex, social matters of Latin America. It is one of my favorite courses I have taken at Harvard! The course was so much fun, and I would highly recommend it.","Not a ton of work and a great, lively class where you learn a lot and keep up Spanish speaking skills.","I would definitely recommend this course- though sometimes it feels like there's a lot of busy work outside the classroom, the in-class part of the course is really fun and engaging.","This class is interesting and fun, and you will learn a lot. It asks for a bit of study every day, but it is never going to be a source of stress. I highly recommend it.","The grammar section of the class moves quickly, so make sure you are comfortable with most concepts."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Takes up a surprising amount of time.  There's never too much homework, but you have to do homework every day, which does take its toll.","I would tell them to actually watch the movies, because they are quite good.","Spanish 30 is the next step from Spanish C, but the classes weren't that different. Spanish 30 demands more work, but it's similar to Spanish C. It's cool to learn about four Spanish-speaking countries.","This class has the hardest working TFs at Harvard and is such a pleasure to learn from them. The topics, literature, and movies used as course materials are very informative of the Spanish culture. It has also motivated me to apply to the Argentinian study abroad next year.","Section: can have great discussions and make a lot of friends depending on the class\r\nAssignments: generally pretty easy, just a matter of completing them\r\nTests: not too bad if you spend a little bit of time with the textbook and learning the relevant grammar\r\nPapers: also not terrible if you're good with grammar and such, there are plenty of topics to choose from always\r\nProjects: sometimes a bit tedious, but nothing to complain about","The first half of this class is pretty similar to Spanish C. About the same amount of work, about the same amount of time commitment and skill level required. For some reason though, there will be less people in your class who are grossly under-qualified, and much more that are grossly overqualified. The second half of the course gets a little more difficult, and there will be much more nuance added to the topics that you've studied in other Spanish classes. How you feel about this course (and I'm pretty sure most other language courses) is very TF-dependent, so if you're not feeling your TF during the first week, find an excuse to change!","This is a good way to consolidate everything you learned in Spanish C or in high school.","This class has a strong culture component which is refreshing and interesting -- if you have taken Spanish 30 or an equivalent of about 3 or 4 years of solid Spanish background, the grammar aspects of the course should not be troublesome -- mostly a review!","This is a good step after Spanish C that doesn't require too much work and really does help improve your Spanish abilities","The only reason I would not fully recommend this class is because I am not good with foreign languages. This class, for students who are only taking it to fulfill the language requirement, will be challenging. You will still pass fairly easily but if you don't enjoy the material, it will be hard to engage yourself in the work enough to get an A. If you enjoy language, Spanish 30 will be an excellent class for you.","Spanish is hard because there's homework every night and it inevitably becomes second tier to the rest of your work, which means you fall behind, and then the ball just starts rolling in the wrong direction.","You won't get to practice super authentic conversation, but your understanding of different Spanish-speaking countries and their cultures were improve, and you get to read some cool texts and watch some fun movies.","It is a difficult class but is worth it if you want to push yourself toward fluency","Spanish 30 is a very worthwhile and enjoyable course that builds students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. Be aware that the class requires a significant time commitment to do well and that your experience will depend on your section leader.","Significantly harder than Spanish C. At least, is graded more harshly. Know all your Spanish grammar COLD! Harvard doesn't teach any grammar -- just gives you a textbook and your \"homework\" is to teach it to yourself, and do practice in class. Shouldn't it be the other way around...? You know, with the teacher teaching the grammar and the workbook as practice?","The material is okay, but I was looking for more conversational spanish and more of a space to practice speaking the language. Not super impressed","Spanish 30 is a great course that continues the trend of great Romance language classes at Harvard. The class was pretty rigorous with all of the grammatical exercises and readings to do for the next day's class. The discussion-based format of the class definitely pushed me to study harder and practice conjugations and grammatical concepts we were learning.","this class helped to make me much more comfortable speaking in spanish. very comfortable, casual environment to learn in","Spanish 30 is just a continuation of Spanish C. You definitely need a background in Spanish but it is not a difficult class.","It's a great course for learning Spanish.","Even though you can get by without doing the readings, it is helpful to do so and is the only way to actually improve your Spanish.","I would tell future students that although sometimes the course can feel bogged down in fine points of grammar, the familiarity gained by reading the pieces for the course deepen one's understanding of the language.","You'll get as much out this class as you put into it. Many of the texts are actually very interesting and benefit from close analysis. With that said, it's often difficult to take the class seriously when you're bombarded with a virtual forest of worksheets and smaller assignments. There's a balance to be struck between tending to the more substantive texts and grammatical concepts and recognizing when certain homework assignments simply aren't particularly enlightening or helpful.","It was a fun class learning about the different spanish-speaking countries and also improves your speaking and listening skills considerably.","There is a lot more focus on the cultural aspect, which can be interesting.","It's a great course for students who have done Spanish in the past and want to brush up on grammar, reading and speaking skills."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["While it was a fun experience overall, I will admit that it was much more demanding than I had imagined at the beginning of the year. It was also my first Spanish class since senior year of high school and I am a sophomore, so there was definitely the element of challenge. Papers are graded harshly to get you ready for more rigorous Spanish classes afterwards.","This is a really great course! It's very similar in structure to Spanish C, but the grammar topics are a little harder and require more studying for the exams. That said, you can definitely do well in the course by keeping up with the grammar outside of class, and exams are very fair. Additionally, I found lessons and assignments to be interesting. Andr\u00c3\u00a9s is great!","Take this class if you want to get better at spanish, in all components. It is alot of material covered at a fast pace, but you will end up feeling like you truly got better at spanish.","The experience in the class will be shaped by your section leader so spend time choosing who will work best for you","This class is a great way for you to further your language skills. It is different from Spanish C and earlier classes in that it delves much deeper into the historical and cultural backgrounds of the four different countries, and the guest speakers and extra events adds a nice touch to the class as well. It was great to look at so many different artworks, music, social and political movements, and historical events that provided a real context to many of the themes and ideas we were learning.","Be aware that you do have to use the book a lot if you want to succeed on the test. Section isn't really for learning grammar, but more for practicing it through speaking and discussing course materials.","Good solid intermediate-level Spanish class.","Definitely need prior Spanish experience. Helps less with improving conversational ability","It was a great class to learn about the culture of numerous countries, and even to begin to break down some standard literature. However, a solid knowledge of Spanish grammar is definitely needed, and maybe some background in writing essays in spanish.","If you have taken spanish before this course is a great way to brush up on what you have learned and to reinforce grammar rules. It is also a fun way to learn about 4 countries Latin American counties.","The class moves too quickly for any depth in the grammar portion, which is the only thing that is tested in this course.  If you want to only care about grammar in Spanish, this is the class for you.","If you intend to pursue a citation in Spanish or are very comfortable with the language, this is a fine class. However, if it is your first foreign language class at Harvard, you should perhaps consider dropping down a level to get used to the workload and the intensity. It is not the same as a high school level language class.","This class is good because it focuses on both speaking\/listening and reading\/writing, but keep in mind that a lot of the material that you talk about is on South American culture and history, which may be interesting to some, but wasn't really what I expected out of the class.","Practice your spanish speaking as much as possible in class","I thought this class gave me a good review and refinement of my knowledge of Spanish grammar.  The assignments and assessments were helpful to learning and generally quite reasonable in terms of time and effort needed.  The course this year included reading a Spanish-language short novel, and while this was very helpful for improving reading and vocabulary, incoming students should know they will likely have to budget significantly more time for reading the novel than they do for the other assignments.  The reading assignments for the novel seemed to be a bit longer than the other reading assignments given in the course, the vocabulary seemed more difficult to decipher, and one's level of comprehension needed to be higher for the novel reading assignments than for the assignments for the other texts, as each novel reading assignment, of course, built upon the information from the last reading.","It is a very fun, engaging class that both improves your grammar and your wrting\/speaking skills","Maria was a fantastic teacher and to try and be in her section.","I recommend this class. I learned a lot about Latin American culture.","It is a really interesting course that focuses on the cultural exploration of four spanish speaking countries while developing some grammar and language skills along the way.","This class does not have a heavy workload, but can be difficult if you lack the necessary Spanish background. The exams test grammar and vocabulary that is mostly learned outside of class. I took Spanish 30 even though a lower level was suited for me. I learned a lot through immersion and my Spanish significantly improved, but I was disappointed with my performance on exams.","It was one of the few classes in which I had a lot of fun while learning.","Spanish 30 is a great class to take if you're interested in learning more about the cultures of several Spanish-speaking countries. Although grammar is definitely still covered, it is not the focus of the class, which made it more enjoyable than some other Spanish classes I've taken in the past.","Take this class if you want to practice your speaking skills.","Really interesting topic on four Latin American countries.  It is not very difficult, but you need to know Spanish.","Spanish 30 is a fun language course, especially if you have Andres as your professor. The chance to incorporate food, music and literature into the study of a language was always exciting and fun.","This course made me so much more aware of the varying cultures and dialects between the Spanish-speaking countries.","Andres is a great teacher. My Spanish improved tremendously and I am extremely satisfied with my experience in the class. That being said, I like Spanish very much and wanted to learn it. It is important that you care about learning the language in order to enjoy the class.","This is a good class to take if you want to solidify grammar rules and learn about Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.","Great continuation after Spanish c.","Spanish is gr888888888.","I loveeeeddd this class!! Carolina was amazing!! I think the course can be really awesome but it all depends on who your professor is. The material is interesting (especially the part on food) and the assignments are straight forward and challenging but not difficult.. Great course!","This class requires daily work but not more than an hour. It is really interesting because you get to learn about four different cultures through literature, music, film and food.","Spanish 30 was a great way for me to expose myself to the language after not having taken it for years. Perfect combination of breadth and depth! Be prepared for daily work, but it's really manageable if you stay on top of it.","This is a really well designed course and you will learn a lot about the four countries while also having the opportunity to practice your Spanish speaking skills.  How much you end up enjoying the course probably comes down a lot to your teacher and your classmates.  My teacher, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 \u00c3\u0081ngel de Leon Gonzalez, was fantastic.  He was interesting, approachable, and overall just a great person to get to know.  He spent a ton of time writing out constructive feedback on everything we turned in, and corrected us when we spoke in class without making us feel inferior.  I had the chance to speak in Spanish every day in that class, and I never felt intimidated.","In highschool I was able to get by without being very good at speaking but these class sizes make it much more difficult to do that. You get pushed out of your comfort zone but I definitely got better at spanish.","Carolina is incredible, if you want to get better at spanish you really have to apply yourself to this class, while you can also just kind of float through without improving or doing poorly.","Fun class in which you have plenty of practice improving your spanish fluency.","It's a great course! You get to learn a lot about other cultures through fun and interesting approaches i.e. music videos, food, novels, news articles, documentaries, movies, etc. Plus, my listening and speaking skills improved incredibly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"4.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"81","response rate":"76.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 30","course_id":"4478","cat_num":"0479","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"9","4s":"26","5s":"25"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 30","course_id":"4478","cat_num":"0479","1s":"1","2s":"13","3s":"35","4s":"7","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 30","course_id":"4478","cat_num":"0479","1s":"6","2s":"39","3s":"10","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
