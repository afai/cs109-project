If you're interested in African anthropology, you'll love this course. Even though they're celebrity professors (at least I consider them to be such), they're the most kind and warm I've met here at Harvard. Feel very free to reach out to them; they are always happy to give of their time and listen. If I could take this course all over again, I definitely would!","If you're interested in Africa, I think this might be the best course at the school. Little workload with incredibly high quality discussion, and an experience of interaction between working academics."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Recommended to those who have a passion for engaging and understanding Africa Rising? in a board spectrum of perspective as well as a reflection on our globalized world, and a view on society from another lens.","At times, the discussions will go over your head, whether it because of the eloquent graduate students or discussion style of the Comaroffs, but it was undoubtedly one of my favorite courses this semester. I learned about so many topics and a lot of which I had no interest in whatsoever before the course. Take the course if you want to engage in discussion, but if you want an easy course.","The Comaroffs are amazing people and professors! They are so brilliant and enthused about the subject material and it shines through the lectures and conversations. The course has minimal readings and work but it does require extensive discussions and thought to work through the weekly articles. Doing so, however, makes the course worthwhile and fosters a fabulous learning environment. The opportunity to interact with the authors of the articles discussed in class is an element unknown to most other courses at Harvard. Relish it.","It was a pleasure to take a course with the Comaroffs. They are extremely brilliant yet have the ability to make sure that everyone knows their ideas are valid and valued. They created a great learning environment by having students present on the papers every week and thus taking greater ownership of their ideas.","This class is an excellent way to get an idea of what the current topics of interest are in African Studies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom work in progress papers that will be published in the upcoming year\u00e2\u20ac\u201din a range of disciplines. The workload outside of class is relatively light, which allows for a deep reading of weekly papers and productive class conversations. There is a lot of flexibility around the final paper topic as well, allowing students to apply their own research interests to select themes in the course.","I wish there was a little bit more of a structure\/holistic perspective on the class. It would have made the discussions much more interesting if we were drawing connections from week to week."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 209b","course_id":"82","cat_num":"65212","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 209b","course_id":"82","cat_num":"65212","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 209b","course_id":"82","cat_num":"65212","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
