Prof Kimel is so nice and really lets the class guide itself. That being said, it was a little more heavy into politics than I was expecting, although I could see this easily swinging back to being more psych if the class composition was different. Overall, I would totally recommend this to anyone who finds it even mildly interesting. I didn't know anything about politics before taking it and I feel like I've learned a ton about that, AND the psych that underlies it.","Such a fun class. Two hours a week of watching Ted Talks and discussing both the divisiveness of American politics and the psychological mechanisms that fuel polarization (and a couple that help reduce polarization) is a great use of a class.","I love this course! I would definitely take it if you're interested in the way people's minds work when it comes to political affiliation.","The learning\/workload ratio in this class is astronomically high. I learned tremendous amounts of useful and interesting information from this class that I will use throughout my life, but never felt stressed about assignments or deadlines. Professor Kimel is a fantastic discussion facilitator, and her presentations were great for starting extremely interesting conversations. Definitely recommend this class.","Take it. The material is interesting, it's pretty easy, Sasha is great, and you won't be disappointed!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"1.80","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1558","course_id":"11440","cat_num":"61125","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1558","course_id":"11440","cat_num":"61125","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1558","course_id":"11440","cat_num":"61125","1s":"3","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
