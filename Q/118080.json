You learn a lot about immigration, and the bond between the class gets pretty close as time goes on. Coordinating with the local organizations can get a little difficult depending on what org. you want to work with, but it's just a small worry. Overall, great class!","This is a fun class where you get the chance to speak a lot of Portuguese and think about immigration in the US.","This was a really bad class when looking only at the section component. But the opportunity to volunteer in the community was great. I don't see why you would need to take the course to volunteer though. I really don't think the course helped much in the way of learning the language.","This was a great class. Make sure to be very proactive about finding organizations to volunteer with","Be prepared to spend time in your internship but it's worth it!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Heloisa is amazing. Definitely take this class for an intermediate portuguese. The volunteer component only needs to be 1-2 hours a week.","Work at MAPS. This course is very insightful. Not too work-intensive, but it is involved.","Sections and readings are a little boring, but internships would be cool if they were better set up.","This class is wonderful! It allows you to get involved in the Portuguese-speaking community in Boston while enhancing your knowledge and comprehension of the Portuguese language (and culture!).","I am glad that this class meets twice a week. It is also a benefit to the class that we do so much writing. This really makes it a stand out from other Portuguese classes. I think this class could be improved if the internship portion were more organized and if the class discussion were more directed."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PORTUG 59","course_id":"4449","cat_num":"3322","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PORTUG 59","course_id":"4449","cat_num":"3322","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PORTUG 59","course_id":"4449","cat_num":"3322","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
