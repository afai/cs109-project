'11":{"comments":["Combinatorics is a fun subject, and it's easy to conceptualize.  It's a good math elective.","Taught by different professor each year with no set material. Scope out the professor."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Really fun course.","Combinatorics is a really cool subject that is worth exploring.  Sukhada Fadnavis is a very good teacher who does not just lecture to, but engages the class.","A very fun and interesting topic."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a really great class to take for math concentrators (or really for anyone with an interest in learning math and with some proof experience). I think that it's likely to be the lightest workload you'll ever have. Even so, I felt myself really improving as a problem solver, and I also learned a lot about many topics in combinatorics. Sukhada Fadnavis is also one of the kindest people ever, and she is a joy to be in class with! I would highly recommend this class!","If you're looking for an easy math class, this is it. The problem sets are pretty doable without going to lecture (take it from someone who knows...) but there's still a lot of really interesting material. Make sure you spend the time to read the text; if you do that, you'll be able to kill the problem sets for the most part. One of the TFs from my year was kind of a jerk, but you'll get over things like that. Start the problem sets early - even if they're easy, they're not easy enough that you can throw them together the night before and still get a good night's sleep.","Take this class seriously as it's a decent amount of work and pretty challenging. Definitely not what I was expecting when I signed up, but a very pleasant surprise!","Professor Fadnavis is great, she really wants her students to succeed and is very understanding. She makes lectures fun and the material is cool and useful.","Combinatorics with Sukhada was great. I would not pass on this course if you're interested in combinatorics at all.","This course was a lot of fun.  There was definitely a focus on group discussions.  There was enough work so that the course should be treated seriously, yet not once did I feel overwhelmed by this class.  The midterm was take-home and the final was an expository paper, so the course is overall a low-pressure and highly engaging experience.","If you like combo you might as well take this. It's really easy and will fill in the cracks about some stuff you didn't already know.","This class is not especially time-consuming, and it covers some interesting material. Take it if you want some fun math problems!","It is a very interesting topic, the class is structured in such a way that you take away what you want from the class.","Fun and accessible, pure and practical, challenging and non-stressful, Combinatorics with Professor Fadnavis was one of my favorite math classes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken so far. As a teacher, Fadnavis is clear and engaging, keenly aware that students of various levels of background and ability take her class, and teaching in a way that caters to all. Next year is her last year here at Harvard, so take advantage of her while you can. You can expect reasonable p-sets, a take-home midterm, and a short final research paper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c your choice of topic. What more could you ask for? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to regret taking a course like this.","I would recommend taking this course, although with some reservation. The material is engaging enough and Professor Fadnavis tries her best to stimulate a collaborative problem solving environment, even if the material sometimes it's not too deep, possibly due to the vast amount of different areas in Combinatorics covered in this class.","Combinatorics is a fun subject!!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"16","response rate":"81.25","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 155r","course_id":"2874","cat_num":"6612","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 155r","course_id":"2874","cat_num":"6612","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 155r","course_id":"2874","cat_num":"6612","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
