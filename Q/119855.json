Having said that, you will simply learn more by reading her notes for two hours than you will by sitting in her class.  If you can avoid this class and learn the material otherwise, it's hard to imagine you not being better off.","There's some good stuff in this class that is useful, but it's not presented in such a way and is kind of a chore to get through. I feel like people kind of gave up on it pretty quickly. Honestly I would just tell them that I didn't enjoy this class, and feel like I didn't get that much out of it. I kind of hated that class, and I hate my self for saying that."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is really hard, but the material is essential for anybody who would like to do theoretical work in the future."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.40","difficulty":"4.60","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOSTAT 251","course_id":"419","cat_num":"5280","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOSTAT 251","course_id":"419","cat_num":"5280","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOSTAT 251","course_id":"419","cat_num":"5280","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
