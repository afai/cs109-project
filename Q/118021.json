Definitley worth taking even if your focus isn't mathematical modeling.","This class was extremely demanding but very useful and interesting.","I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a substantial background in mathematics.  In this class I have found that the more familiarity you have with concepts discussed in class, the more you can take away from the experience.

The more math background you have before taking this class the better. The final project is huge and can take over your reading\/exams period if you're not careful, so plan accordingly if you take this class. Also, the workload for this class in general comes in waves--sometimes this class will seem like no work at all, and at other times it will take over.","I didn't really like my experience in this class, and would advise people not to take it as an elective.  The lecture material isn't really relevant except to learn about techniques other people used to tackle problems.  I found the psets trivial and useless.

Also the final project takes a lot of time. I definitely got way better with Matlab and learned some useful stuff, but the course was a bit dry.","I loved Professor Bossert's enthusiasm for the material. He always asks questions to check for understanding but will never leave you hanging.

It's great to have a teammate who knows MatLab, but if you don't learn it also, you'll run into trouble when the term project rolls around. Bill, Margo, and Avi are all great and it's nice that they switch off who teaches the lesson.

The most you'll be working is for your term project at the end of the semester, which about 40 hours of work are supposed to go into. Other than that, I spent less time on this class every week than I did on my other classes. A lot of the work you do you also have to do with groups, so group work is a huge element in the class.","This course is a great applied math course to take - as long as you have the \"suggested prerequisites\" listed on the course site. It is difficult to catch up with other people in the course who have had those prerequisites if you have not.","Generally it's quite relaxing, and the professors are good. The workload will spike at times, and then it's a pain. The final project will be time-intensive -- not prohibitively so, but much more than the first few weeks of class. So take that into account during shopping. I'm glad I took it.","Overall, unstructured and I felt like I didn't learn much.

I highly recommend taking it with friends since you will do two big projects and weekly in class assignments with them.","This class certainly has the potential to become a great class, but right now, it feels a little underwhelming to be frank.

You must be actively listening during lectures and workshops.","This class was terrible -- not well organized, incredibly scattered, and not enough support from instructors was given.

Hopefully they up the level of the course a bit and work in more readings, more math, and more work.","MatLab or Coding background is highly recommended although the instructors claim that this is for all levels.

Lectures are alright; the group setting of the room is really great for the workshops. This class is really all about what you put into it, so if you slack off, you can still do well, but you probably won't get much out of it. The final project requires some thought, but was still pretty much. I got the most out of it, as you end up applying modeling skills to a completely new problem.","The material is very fascinating.","Keep an eye out for a good final project topic throughout the semester. Expect to spend a lot of time at the end of semester on your final project, so planning reading period accordingly is a good idea. Otherwise, this course provided an introduction to a variety of models and techniques.","This class is not hard, but be sure to put work into the projects.  Grading can be tough.  Take a differential equations course before taking this course.","The grading in this course isn't as easy as Professor Bossert makes it seem. I felt like I was struggling knowing where I stood in the class because we didn't have graded homework or exams. Also, I felt like the team presentations were graded a bit harshly.

You sit in groups doing assignment that have clearly not been tested in advance, and you don't learn anything. You will then be graded on a pair of projects that have very arbitrary standards. However, the current professor is retiring, so I assume things can only get better.","On a week-to-week basis, this course has a relatively light workload. However, the two main assignments (team project and final project) can be quite challenging, especially given most students' lack of prior experience with MATLAB and modeling. The final project took nearly 60 hours of work during reading period, so I would definitely recommend starting before Thanksgiving if possible.","Not structured. If you know Matlab then money in the bank. Else good luck!","The format of this course was excellent. Professor Bossert rarely lectured. Instead, we would have readings and short \"reading check\" homework assignments (they took like 1hr), followed workshops with a team of students during class. The readings were often confusing, and I do wish they had been longer for the sake of explaining the model better, but after working with them for a while the underlying model becomes increasingly clear (and often isn't that complicated).\r\n\r\nMany people will probably complain that you don't learn anything in this class, and this is somewhat true. The most tangible thing you learn is how to solve certain problems in MATLAB. You won't learn much new math, and interestingly enough, there are no concrete lessons on how to model (I'm hoping they'll at least introduce some general guidelines for modeling next year).\r\n\r\nThe way we learned to model in this class was by reading the derivations of other models and analyzing some of those models' implications during the in-class workshops. This is very subtle. During the year, I had a hard time pointing to things I was learning in this class. But what you learn is how to ask interesting questions of your model. You learn how models are created, what kinds of assumptions people tend to make, and what the implications of these assumptions are. You learn what doing stability analysis on a differential equation actually means, so later on you can decide for yourself whether or not it'd make sense. By reading other models and working with them, you slowly absorb the fundamental techniques of modeling.\r\n\r\nAs far as workload goes, it's very minimal outside of class most of the time. I'd say about 2hrs per week. The two spikes in workload were the team presentation (keep it simple, don't show too many graphs) and the individual project (more complex, but still try to summarize your results clearly). When I was doing the individual project, I realized that I had actually learned something in this class, for I was able to ask some interesting questions of my model (these questions took days to come up with, but once I had them I knew how to do the analysis due to my new MATLAB skills). \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, START THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT EARLY. I had a timeline set. I had written down exactly when I was going to do each thing. I started modeling over Thanksgiving break. I met with a TF. Everything made sense on paper, and I thought I'd be done well before the deadline. But then, during reading period, my model failed. It was just too hard to analyze, and too much was going on (it was an individual agent simulation). I had to start the entire thing over with less than a week left. So don't just plan early. Actually start trying to get results early. You never know what's going to happen.\r\n\r\nAll in all, you'll learn to understand models, and in a very subtle way you'll learn to model as well. My hope is that there will be more workshops centered around actually modeling things next year, and fewer on analysis of existing models.","It's a very easy course I did to fulfill the honors requirement and I enjoyed my final project. The support felt lacking at times though.","The class overall didn't take too much time, with the exceptions of the projects. DON'T WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO DO YOUR FINAL PROJECT. You'll get into the lull of only a couple hours per week spent on this course, but at the end, it will take over your time, far more so than you think going into it. Make sure you have the time to devote to the project (aka don't take a bunch of other project classes with this. CS50 and AM115 were quite hard to balance the last week).","If you put in the work the teaching staff asks of you and maybe a little bit more on your own out of curiosity, you will take away a lot and will like the course a lot. Readings and workload very manageable. Start the final project early and make use of office hours for it.","This iteration of the course was definitely different from a traditional math course in that class functioned by way of groups doing workshops, relying on having done the readings beforehand. In this way, it lets you work through the various topics on your own and have experience \"modeling\". However, I didn't feel particularly prepared to work through the final individual modeling project.","It's a fairly good class and every week it has a different model that you discuss and then play around with in different workshops in class. Workload is not bad (a weekly reading check assignments + group project + individual project) but you really should not take this class if you haven't taken differential equations.","I think its a very strangely structured course-at least it was this past semester. There are mini problem sets that are labeled as \"reading checks\" but then also graded pretty strictly-which is fine but they should just be clear about it. I think you can pick up important skills in this class but if the class was a bit more organized or structured, it might have been better.","This was a fun class. It requires very little work outside of class (with the exception of the final project) and yet I still felt like I learned useful skills. In each class, we would work through a workshop and with each workshop, we learned about a new model and tried it out in Matlab. I loved how hands-on it was and the teaching staff was generally really helpful. I found the final project quite difficult - after having the structure of the workshops all semester, I found it hard to lose all structure and simply go find something\/anything and model it. That being said, the final project while time consuming was a great learning experience as well.\r\n\r\nNB. Since Professor Bossert will not be teaching this course again, I am not sure this commentary will be helpful in your course selection. The class may be very different in the future.","For recommending this class: it is not for just anyone, as the math can be conceptually difficult. For math people, though (especially those actually in Applied Math), it's great. Makes sure you are individually capable of all of the work, as the group aspect makes it easy to sometimes slack off and fall behind. Also, the time distribution is weird and uneven. Most weeks, it will take <3 hours, but when projects are coming up, it spikes. The group project saw my put in something like 20+ hours of meeting to discuss a topic, work things out, etc. for a 10-12 minute presentation. The final project should also be started early.","The final project was a great experience; it was really satisfying at the end when you realize you have made a real contribution to the field of applied mathematics by creating a model that has never been made before. Make sure you have a good topic though - I did, but my friends who procrastinated on choosing topics really struggled later on.","Don't do individual agent simulations for your projects.","The classes are fun, low-key learning opportunities. The projects are hard, so start them in advance.","This was a nice course in that it didn't require a lot of weekly work, but allowed you to get your hands dirty with matlab. However, there was very little guidance given, especially for the two projects which produced way more stress than they needed to for the students.","Know Matlab. Take Applied Math 50 before taking this. While they encourage students of all different applied math backgrounds to take the course, it is hard to succeed if you do not know Matlab or some of the skills you learn in differential equations classes.","This class is interesting and deals with a wide variety of topics. You can also choose to work with the type of techniques you most enjoy on the projects. The projects are daunting and expectations are high, but resources are available. I think taking AM105 beforehand makes the class easier.","Pay attention in class during the workshops, even though it may be easy not to. Seek guidance early on on the final project, which is relatively unstructured.","The format is interesting, but the team and final projects get you almost no guidance and can be really painful. Also nobody does the workshops beforehand.","This course and its material has a lot of potential.\r\n\r\nThe material is incredibly useful, and the course delves into a wide variety of applications, including the spread of epidemics, the flow of traffic, and lines at banks versus supermarkets. It's not necessarily mind-blowing or challenging, but it's interesting to see how you can derive the big picture from looking at the smaller factors. And the course final project allows you to apply these techniques to any topic you want.\r\n\r\nThe course structure is very different from the traditional approach in that readings are done at home (with a small homework assignment to make sure you did the reading) as opposed to lectures in class. The first half hour of class might be devoted to answering questions about the readings, but then the rest of class is devoted to doing workshops in groups where you explore and extend what you learned in the reading. This way you have the TFs and the professor there to help you with the actual implementation of these models.\r\n\r\nThat said, the course could be made much more rigorous and was ultimately not satisfying for me. While the material is interesting, I feel that I did not need a course to learn the material presented in class. After all, most of the readings are done at home, and an hour in class is too short to delve into anything interesting regarding a particular model. I felt like we always just implemented a model described in the readings, made a couple modifications, and was done with it.","Professor Bossert does an excellent job of structuring and delivering this course, especially with his model of short homework assignments and in-class modeling projects. I thought this was very effective, especially with the TF's help. However, I have two complaints. First, if you have taken advanced courses in math, applied math, or statistics, then this course becomes somewhat redundant and it's unfortunate that it's necessary for the Applied Mathematics concentration modeling requirement. Second, the grading scheme for team projects was an epic joke. They gave the highest grades to the groups who essentially copied models from in-class workshops and gave the lowest scores to those who tried something more advanced and original. Why would you punish originality and hard work? So in that sense, the grading scheme is very broken. Having said that, I'm generally glad I took the course because I picked up various modeling strategies along the way.","This course has the potential to be great.  However, it needs to be restructured.","Bossert is retiring, so it is unclear how the class will be without him. This was a great class this semester though, and a very fun way to explore modeling and become familiar with MatLab.","I really liked the structure of the class. The workshops were extremely effective--I was constantly engaged--a much better experience than doing problem sets. The workshops themselves were a little bit on the easy side. The reading materials could be confusing at times.","This class is little work during the term except for the final project. The final project is rewarding but also a lot of work. The professor is kind of crazy and it seems like grading for the class will be extremely subjective.","Some experience with programming\/Matlab is useful, as is familiarity with ODEs (e.g., AM 105), though this isn't essential. You don't learn much throughout the semester, just how to apply specific models which isn't very applicable in future situations. Get started early on the final project, it is very time consuming. Other than that, very little work throughout the semester, but don't expect to learn much.","This class is a great way to get practice modeling and using MATLAB.  The team structure makes the course informal and much more fun, and it's effective because you can also learn from your teammates.  It's probably a good idea to make sure you're putting in a consistent effort throughout, though, or you may end up using more MATLAB-savvy teammates as a crutch.","Workshop style is unusual. Do the workshops and stay focused. It is easy to just get by not doing any work, but that will doom you for the final project.","You get as much as you put in. Make sure to get a good group. You can learn a lot if you are motivated or nothing at all if not. Chill course; group discussion format was very interesting and a nice change.","Take this course!!! You get a lot of learning for little work. I loved Professor Bossert, but since he's not teaching it I'm not sure how the next professor (and his or her class) will be.","This class needs some revamping.  The workshop format is great in theory but leaves a lot of unaccountability.  It's easy to sit there and not do anything most classes.  The TFs generally walk around without too much engagement, and some of them sometimes don't even know much about the workshop.  That being said, the workload is minimal, but grading is very unclear.\r\n\r\nHomework is rather silly.  It's supposed to be nontrivial if you haven't done the reading and trivial if you have.  I found that a lot of the time, the reading had nothing to do with the homework.  Some homework was nontrivial even after going through the readings multiple times.  The homework absolutely required knowledge of differential equations (AM105 should be a prereq for this class).  Furthermore, the homework was given, as the professor said, to ensure that the students did the reading; this seems too much like high school to me and accomplishes very little.\r\n\r\nMATLAB is super important.  Ideally, at least one person in your group is very familiar with it.  You have to know MATLAB to get anything out of this course.\r\n\r\nGroup project was graded on weird criteria.  \"Creativity\" counts more than you think.  The actual math part is less important than you think.\r\n\r\nThe individual project at the end of the semester takes up a lot of time, and it's definitely worth it to start thinking early about topics.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bossert no longer will be teaching the course, so be careful when shopping in the future because it'll be a new professor.  This course should be the most important course offered in the applied math department, but instead it ends up being one of the worst structured in the department."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Interesting, light workload. Very broad.","The projects can be fun and allow applied math people to use the things learned in previous classes to build models.","It's not a lot of work weekly, but as you're going do pay attention to a few topics that interest you, and give them a little more attention and maybe earmark them if they're something you might wanna work on for a group project.","qa","Professor Kuang is a very nice guy and wants this class to be good. Unfortunately right now it is a bit unorganized and expectations aren't always clear for the assignments. The workload is very light when projects aren't due (they are all you are graded on during the semester). I would suggest starting all the projects early.","Please take it!! And preferrably as a junior or a sophomore! It really helps you nail down the routine and basic good habits to develop for to be excellent in mathematical modelling. The things to pay attention to, how to use different coding packages and techniques with data to asnwer a problem, how to work with other people and receive critical feedback! I loved it! If you are a big fan of meaningful teamwork, this is your class!","Professor Kuang and this course overall is excellent. You are exposed to a lot of different ways of thinking about problems and you will get out exactly what you put in regarding the material as a whole.","Great course, please be prepared to pay attention in lecture and bounce ideas off the TF and professor!","This course is a really great hands on introduction to basic mathematical modeling using MATLAB. The workshops and group projects were a great way to actually apply the material that we learned in class, so you will leave this class with a sense that you actual gained some tangible skills, which is really nice. Don't expect to learn any hardcore modeling\/mathematics though, most of the topics covered are done so quickly and at a really surface level.","You must be good at Matlab, not just kind of know it.","Great if you want to learn MATLAB and do your own stuff - could be better-organized and have more clear objectives.","this is the most useless class at harvard.","really interesting material but kind of disorganized","Make sure to have some background in applied math when taking.","Great class.  Not a significant workload for a concentration class, but learned how to approach modeling with MATLAB.  Make sure you don't put off the final individual project for too long.","Some lectures were cool, the teachers were great, class overall is worth taking.  Projects were graded pretty hard but by the end it ended up being very helpful.","I am a senior who has been taking applied math courses all throughout Harvard. I wish I had taken this class sooner. It helps you view every math context in a modeling perspective. All my past applied math classes seemed to matter and make much more sense (in terms of practicality) while taking this class. Taking modeling early will open your perspective for all your future math, stat, econ, CS, bio, chem, physics courses. Don't make the mistake I made, and try to take it early, sophomore and juniors.","The material in the class could have been interesting, but I don't feel like I learned much. Lectures were not particularly engaging, and the professor spent time just providing the model, but not explaining how that model was arrived at, and why the parameters were chosen, or how to think about approaching a model. I was definitely looking for more of the latter when I chose to take this class. \n\nThe in-class exercises are good, but challenging unless you have some conception of MATLAB. It's easy not to pay attention in the class, but to get the most value out of it, it's necessary to pay attention and perform the exercises.\n\nThe workload is very light for the most part\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno homework assignments or mandatory sections. During group project times, though, the workload spiked immensely and many a late night were dedicated to these projects. They were also the funnest part of the class, as it was actually creating a model from scratch for a topic of choice.","This is an amazing class! While I can say the same about a lot of classes at Harvard. This is a class where you can apply the knowledge 5 years down the line. Very applicable and interesting! Definitely take this class if you have the capacity!!","I took this course with Prof. Kuang, and it was great! The lectures were interesting, but the material is never tested -- no problem sets or exams. Instead the grade is based on two group projects and one individual project, were you have free reign to model whatever you like."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"5.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"42","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 115","course_id":"1122","cat_num":"1768","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"5","4s":"17","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APMTH 115","course_id":"1122","cat_num":"1768","1s":"4","2s":"13","3s":"27","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 115","course_id":"1122","cat_num":"1768","1s":"4","2s":"19","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
