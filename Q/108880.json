I found the class to be weary and academically unstimulating. I do not feel better prepared to tackle a physics problem than I did before the start of this class.","Make sure you read the material and understand it well ahead of the class schedule.","This is a fun class to be in, but be prepared to teach yourself the material from the online textbook. If you can learn and understand from the textbook, the class will be smooth. If not, you might struggle a bit. If you can get past the material, the projects are a lot of fun and make the class worth taking.","Use office hours. Carolann is great! The hardest thing was not understanding expectations and the lack of instruction. I enjoyed working in groups.","This class tries too hard to do 'new age teaching' and actual learning tends to fall through the cracks.  If you are good at teaching yourself material out of a book or enjoy learning from your peers this class is perfect. It is not very difficult, but you should be prepared to put in a lot of time for the projects.","Please, please, please do not take this course unless there are huge changes in the way the course is organized. When you work on projects, you don't get to choose your group members, so if they don't do their share of the work then you are screwed. Also, the guidelines for the project are very vague, so you don't really know what you're supposed to be doing, and you're never really taught how to do the calculations to actually make a project with good, rigorous calculations. Even if you're taking the class to get an easy A, the class isn't worth the stress from having bad group members. If you are taking the class because you actually want to learn physics but through experiments, as the class is advertised, you should DEFINITELY avoid the class. I thought we'd be learning multivariable calculus but we pretty much did no calculus throughout the course. You won't gain a good understanding of physics through this course. No matter how much Prof. Mazur makes the course sound amazing, DO NOT BELIEVE IT. Do not get sucked in.","It's easy, or I think it is. You just need to know how to do the pests; they have this unique style of \"grading\".","The class is annoying, but not hard. The assignments are mostly group projects, and as long as somebody in your group is pretty good at physics you will be ok. The psets are not totally intuitive, but office hours are a huge help on them. No exams whatsoever, so its a low stress course. Much better alternative to Physics 12","This class has SO much potential, but unfortunately it falls short. If you are premed or engineering, or otherwise will need knowledge of physics later, I can't recommend it. If you have already taken physics, you might like it, as long as you remember your old physics and have your high school notes to go off of.  If you have never taken physics, you're out of luck, unless you have the time to read the book cover to cover and self-teach, and then also heavily depend on the kind-heartedness of group members who have had physics to teach you. I do have to say that the teaching staff is outstanding, and that they are really trying. Also, physics aside, I did learn a lot about myself and my abilities as a team-member. I met a ton of extremely nice people and many friends that have outlasted the class--even if nothing else, this class teaches invaluable team skills. There is a lot of potential for this class, the teaching staff is brilliant and kind, and I can only hope it gets better from here.","This is a great class! The teaching staff is amazing and are always willing to help you if you don't understand something. It is helpful if you have some Physics background before taking the class because you essentially have to teach yourself (no lecture component). The projects are fun, but pretty time-consuming if you want to do a good job. Be prepared to put in a lot of time for this class, but other than that, highly recommend!","This class is very free form and a great way to learn physics. The support system is fabulous and as long as you keep up with assignments everything will go very smoothly.","Only take this if the organization improves 100 fold. The idea of it is cool but I'm not too sure if I learned any physics.","This course has some major downfalls.  The fact that you can't search the text online is really, really frustrating, but it doesn't really matter because the text itself is makes things much more complicated than they need be.  While I like the Rube Goldberg and Musical Instrument projects, the astrophysics project was just not reasonable for all that we had covered in the class.  The expectations were at once really high and not clear.","This course can be fun, but it also has some major flaws","When I enrolled in this class, I liked the idea of teaching myself the material and applying it to problems in class in a team setting. Unfortunately, I do not think that this class fits anyone very well. Personally, I had two years of high school physics before taking this course freshman year. The problems on the in class assignments and assessments were too easy. However, I imagine that this class would be extremely difficult for someone with no physics background. \r\n\r\nIf you have a strong physics background, like I did, this will be an easy course but it will require a lot of \"busy work\" time in which you will not really learn anything. I did not enjoy the projects because I did not feel like they applied the physics that I had learned.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a strong physics background, be prepared for a very difficult course. You will not be taught the material in class, and you will have to read two chapters in the textbook (which was not good) each week. Office hours are helpful. \r\n\r\nOverall, I am unlikely to recommend this course, unless it is to someone who has a strong physics background and is ok with not learning much new physics. It is definitely an interesting format for a class, but I am not certain that I will take AP50B in the fall. For a more challenging physics course, take 15a.","This class is a completely different learning experience, but a relatively painless physics. Not to be taken if you'd like experience in calculations to take onto other physics classes.","I would tell the future students that the class is very enjoyable and it is also very rewarding.","I took this as an alternative to the PS2\/3 sequence, and I am so glad that I made that decision! You have to be very self motivated to keep up with the material, since each night you are required to read and understand a chapter of the textbook. However, I really enjoyed the structure of the course; there are no lectures or exams. Rather, you teach yourself the material, work on problems and activities to reinforce your learning of the key concepts in class, and apply these principles to build a product! It was one of the only classes at Harvard where I felt like I was gaining skills that I could use in the real world: working in teams, designing\/building a one of a kind product, and trouble shooting when problems came up. Definitely recommend!","AP50a provides a unique opportunity for interactive learning and working with your peers on three month-long projects. Because class time is used for hands-on activities rather than lectures, it is expected that students come prepared having read the text. Such discipline works for some, and these people can get a lot out of the class. On the other hand, I found that I personally need more structure in learning the material (i.e. through lectures). Projects can be fun if you're in a group of people who are equally motivated - that said, at some time during the course, you'll probably work with some classmates who can't commit as much time to group projects. But the experience of teamwork\/team dynamics is a good one, and AP50a encourages you to reflect on these experiences.\r\nIn terms of teaching staff, Carolann is wonderful and has a lot of availability for office hours.","This course was definitely different from classes I've taken in the past.  The fact that it focused on project-based and hands-on learning was nice, but some of the ideas could've been implemented more effectively.  I think I would have learned more if I had taken Physics 15a, but this course was much easier from everything that I've heard.  Take this over another physics course if you already have a background from high school but might be taking some other tougher classes in your schedule.  Also, keep in mind that a three hour class can seem to go on forever at times.  Overall though, I would still recommend this course.","This is a good class, but it's weird. You get to the end of the semester and wonder what you really learned. It was fun, though.","Even though you get an A in the end, you got through hell because the grading system isn't fair and the teachers are not organized, so they don't tell you everything you have to do, yet they expect you to do a million things and you stress out way too much because of it.","This course made me like Physics and I am not a science person.  Couldn't have asked for a better environment. Also AP50 has the most caring faculty.","This course is a mix of things; if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done physics before, it still approaches it in a novel way, but in a way that is too time-consuming. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take this course unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capped to around 50 or 60 students max.","TAKE THIS CLASS! Great learning environment with professors who really care about you and your success! I think that it offers an approach to physics not found in PS2 or Physics 12\/15\/16. This class is great for those who are self-directed learners and want to work in a team. I learned a lot not only about physics but also about my ability to work as a team member!","From my experience, the majority of the students in this class cared only about their final grade and not about learning the physics. This is not the best environment for learning and as the course is still under development it is difficult for me to recommend this course. Carolaan puts so much into this course  but if you can indeed learn physics independently, you will not need to take this course and if you can not this course will not help you very much.","It's really time-consuming, but in hindsight it asked us to do pretty cool things.","This is a very time-consuming class, so do not take it with other classes that have heavy workloads. I would not recommend this class to students who don't enjoy working in groups because almost all of the assignments are group projects.","Eric Mazur does not care about you. This class is actually his project. Carolann does keep the class together and functional, but prepare for the teaching staff to always be a bit confused on the instructions (which is unfortunate, because all of your time is spent on these \"assignments\" with very little idea of what you are supposed to be doing)","IF you want to get a deep understanding of physics, this is not a good course. but it is fun and light work load to get a light understanding of physics.","FOR ENGINEERS AND THOSE CONSIDERING GRADUATE SCHOOL IN PHYSICS, BIOPHYSICS, PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, ANY PHYSICS-RELATED DISCIPLINE:\r\nAT THIS TIME, BE VERY WARY AND CAREFUL ABOUT TAKING THIS COURSE - this semester's iteration is NOT RIGOROUS enough for your career and studies. My dad is an engineering professor at a major research university and based on my discussions with him, the class does not instill the required quantitative and problem-solving intuition in students needed to solve engineering problems. While the course is relatively easy and much less stressful than other physics alternatives, it would do you a SERIOUS DISSERVICE to take this class. \r\n\r\nI know there aren't many alternatives. Physics 16 is much too hard for most people, Physics 12 has a bad reputation for being MATLAB-heavy, and PS2\/3 is full of premeds. That said, you have to bite the bullet and I would suggest that most people take Physics 12 at this time unless future iterations of AP50 are of necessary rigor.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Depending on how much they change the course, AP50b (Spring) may be much better and nullify any of the concerns I have above. Look to the AP50b comments to see if the rigor has increased to a necessary and satisfactory level.","Take AP50 before seats are full.","This class is not well run. I would recommend avoiding it, or waiting at least a two years more before taking it. The teaching staff are all well-intentioned, but it's really just more stress than it's worth. \r\n\r\nIt's actually quite difficult to learn physics from this course. The textbook is useless, so I recommend finding a good physics textbook to read instead. My grade for this course was based on annotations I made to the textbook via an online tool, so I ended up having to read both the awful textbook for a grade and another textbook to understand it.\r\n\r\n I got better at team-based project work for sure, but that's mostly because I spent most of my time badgering teammates to do their fair share or dealing with ridiculous team problems. (The hallmark of all team-based work) I would say this is actually a strength of the course, but all things considered, there are many courses in the engineering department that could serve better for this kind of experience.","This course is a WASTE OF TIME! The physics that they teach for three-quarters of the course is like REALLY basic physics. Furthermore, all the projects (such as building Rube-Goldberg\/ Musical instrument) can be done without using ANY physics at all (you only need some physics for the report)! It's like playing with toys. The book used in the course is awful, and they don't even have lectures from which you might feel you can pick up something new. Furthermore, the course is new, so it's very disorganized, and there are so many things the course instructors themselves aren't sure of (like they changed some of the grading criteria and evaluation stuff, DURING our course). Only pre-med kids can seriously consider this class, because all they need to do is fulfil their requirements. For those, who are seriously passionate about physics\/engineering, this class will turn out to be an absolute nightmare. You'll be surrounded by students with hardly any knowledge of physics. And if you think you can simply ace this course because you already know most of the physics, well you are wrong. The grading of the pset does not depend on the correctness. You don't have any exams, just these short quizzes, in which you have to share your answer with your(possibly ignorant) team members. \r\nAlso, the whole concept of the working in a team might sound cool, but the way it works in this course is horrible. So basically, at the end, your team members evaluate you and your work. This means, that constantly, you have to suck up to them, because they will be the one shaping up your grade! That's really messed up, in my opinion.\r\nAll in all, it is definitely the worst class I've taken at Harvard. Please consider something more serious such as Physics 15a, or Physical Sciences 12a.","Just a waste of time to be fair. You think you want to take this class because it is supposedly easier, but in the end it just turns out to be frustrating and I am not sure how much I actually learned.","AP50 is a really great course for people who enjoy working in groups. It is nice not to have the stress of midterms of finals looming over you throughout the semester. At times, the course was frustrating because it was easy to feel like you weren't really learning much physics in terms of problem solving etc. since the course was mostly focused on the projects (which didn't have much to do with what we were actually learning in class). I would do it again, however, because I think I learned much more valuable skills about working with my peers and communicating effectively. This is the type of class you talk about when you're in an interview. It was so much different from any other academic experience I've had at Harvard, and I think everyone should experience the model of teaching and assessment that AP50 uses.","I loved this class because it was cool. You don't have exams where you need to regurgitate equations, but instead get to BUILD things! I also loved the group aspect of it, though sometimes it was frustrating. Definitely takes up a lot of time around the projects, but no more than any class would require for exam studying and it's much more fun. TAKE OVER PS2.","AP50 seems like it will be a gem class (no lectures, no exams, no psets) but it's not all that great. The class is not well-run enough to achieve its goal of being interactive\/innovative, and you'll spend way more time than you'd like working on the projects, which then are graded in the span of 5 minutes at the project fairs. There is little to no grade transparency, which is also not great.\r\nThat said, the professors are super nice and it's clear that they care a lot -- maybe in a few years this class will be better once they work out the kinks!","It's very unstructured. Take 12 or 15 if you want significant guidance.","It can be hit or miss with the group work. You could have a great group and develop many good friendships from the class like I did. Or, you could have terrible groupmates and end up making more enemies than friends.","This class is a great way to get a physics requirement done because the professors are awesome and the projects are really cool. If you like structured lectures don't take it.","This class is very often frustrating in its design and lack of organization, but the material it covers is actually very easy. But doing everything in the specific way they want you to do it makes this class annoying. But if they are generous with the final grades then it will have been ok.","Fun and a very moderate workload.","Since this is a fairly new class, I'll try to comment on each of the course's aspects. The projects: I generally really liked these. Beware that the time commitment of the course peaks during the three projects, and that some of your group members may leave the class during the first few weeks. The problem sets: Honestly, these could be amped up in frequency, length, or difficulty to better cement the material. NB system: Weird at first, but actually pretty helpful as the course goes on. The RAAs: definitely not impossible, although I think the individual portion is rushed sometimes. Grading can be a little opaque regarding these, too. Anyway, Carolann is an angel, and, although I already liked this course, I think it has potential to be even greater in the future!","--Don't underestimate the effect of no lectures.  Even if you are a motivated student and think you will always do the reading for the class, the reading is dense (it's not like a humanities class!) and often comes at the same time as psets are due.  \r\n--Take problem set reflections seriously, even though they may seem like a waste of time.  They're worth a lot. \r\n--You had better like building stuff! \r\n--You may have (or at least feel like you have) gaps in your mechanics knowledge upon the completion of this course.","Be aware of the fact that there is no lecture component in this course, and the textbook is dense. This is for sure what the 21st century classrooms will be like, but having been born in the 20th century, I found it hard to adapt to a learning method that required me to be my own teacher.","This is an unbelievably frustrating class- do not take this unless you know this going into it. The grading is arbitrary and confusing, and you will never know how you are doing in the course. The TFs don't know the material nearly as well as they should, and the material is never clearly explained at any point so you can go weeks without having any idea what is going on in the class yet being expected to know it very well. It is very time consuming in the most annoying of ways.","Content is good, team work can be hard.","This class was a huge disappointment. I was really excited about learning physics at the beginning of this course, but that really changed as the semester progressed. This course took up loads and loads of my time, but I hardly learnt anything. The course is built on the premise of peer teaching, but if all of your peers are just as clueless as you are because they're not really learning themselves, then peer teaching kind of falls apart. Of course there were a few people who had a solid high school physics background, and they were able to help, but that's just not enough.\r\nIn the end most of the learning you do is from the textbook - you can hardly call a course that has its students learn most of the material from a textbook revolutionary.","If you are ready for a totally new learning experience, take AP50. You will learn teamwork skills that you wouldn't learn in any other class, and you will learn physics well if you put the time into the assignments.","This course uses a slightly different format than what most students are used to. There are no long boring lectures. This style will benefit most students. however if you in the minority of students who like long lectures you may not like it as much. I found it to be all around great. I would recommend shopping it to see if you like it, if you are looking for a physics class.","This course is great in terms of showing students how physics can be applied to real world problems. It promotes group work and builds some great skills in that regard. However, how much this course helps your knowledge of physics concepts depends on how much effort you are willing to put into the coursework and the readings. If you have a greater interest in theoretical physics, Physica 15a or 16 may be better.","This class takes a very specific type of student to be successful. You need to already know physics or be able to just read a textbook on your own and teach yourself (far easier said than done). You need to be great at working in teams. You need to be very willing to jump through hoops, do busy work and  also be treated vaguely like a preschooler.\r\n\r\nThe class runs something like this: Read an online pdf textbook. Annotate the textbook and get graded on your annotations with no explanation on your mark. Come to class. Work in groups on an online multiple choice quiz. Work on rather unrelated (but super fun) shop projects. Occasionally get slammed with insanely hard problem sets. Go to office hours and copy down the answers to the P set. Never actually get taught anything. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, They are still working out the details of the course but this should not mean you should have to waste your time and money on it.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you are looking for a fairly easy class to fill a physics gen ed requirement, don't mind jumping through tons of hoops and really do not actually want to learn anything, this is the class for you. If you are actually at all interested in learning physics, please take something else.","Stay on top of your reading, and go to office hours to clarify questions that remain unanswered.","If you are looking for a terminal physics course and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind working in group projects, you should certainly consider AP 50a.  The course had teething issues, however, even in its second year, and so you should look carefully at the syllabus and talk with the course staff before deciding to take it.  Areas to look at in particular:  general course organization (hopefully not an issue in year 3 and beyond); the NB system and textbook can be really annoying (try it before you buy it); and zero-sum peer evaluations can be nerve-wracking.  Keep in mind as well that the course philosophy is that you will have to teach yourself most of the material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind that \/ think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to do that anyway, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an issue.","Some parts of the class namely, working with other students and not having lectures, seems nice, but it is not worth it. The class's staff is very disorganized and most of the time I felt like I was enrolled in an online class. You definitely don't learn better in this kind of environment, and I ultimately felt as though I learned very little in the end. If your goal is to just satisfy a physics requirement the most painless way possible, DO NOT take this class. Take some other physics class instead. If you want to actually learn physics, DO NOT take this class. If you want to spend two 3 hour blocks a week learning pretty much nothing and slogging through ridiculous projects, have fun!","Take it if your gung-ho about building things and you don't need that much direction. Take it if you don't care that you have to spend a lot of time to navigate the disorganization of this class because you like physics that much.","The readings are annoying to do and you won't feel like you're learning. Low stress though.","Don't expect to learn anything if you are not motivated beyond tests. You also must enjoy projects and working with other people to enjoy this class.","You must be self-driven because they won't teach you well enough.","Be prepared to do lots of learning on your own time, since this class is very focused on individual and team learning. You must read, do not skim, the textbook in order to understand and fully engage yourself in class activities. Office hours are also very helpful!","Make sure that you understand the problem set rubric","The instructors of this class are great, the assignments are fun, and the textbook is well written, but the grading seems almost arbitrary, and a complete lack of lectures might be a problem for non-physics students.","AP50 is a nice alternative to have from the normal Physics courses (12, 15) but it is still very new and quite disorganized at times. The teaching style that they are trying to accomplish with this course is very interesting and works a lot of the time. You really see yourself growing as a team member and you learn a lot by working with others rather than on your own. It forces you to learn how to work well in groups and the hands-on projects were a nice touch. But if you prefer a classic lecture\/section\/lab course, this is definitely not for you. It is extremely different. Much less stressful than a normal physics course though because there are no major exams, just small quizzes that you work on with your team, no final, and three major projects.","You have to learn everything on your own in this class, unless you have the extra time to go to office hours. It does not feel like you are learning very much throughout the semester, and this can become very frustrating when you feel like you are spending hours on projects that you get very little out of.","If you want to learn physics, take 15a or 12a. If you want an easy physics class, take ps3. If you want to not learn any physics AND feel frustrated about the material and the class, take AP50a."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I would tell them that it is a great course to take if they are very self-starting learners.","Easiest perhaps most enriching way to get that physics credit","great class take it","This class is a fun way to explore physics concepts through projects designed to apply these physics concepts to real-world situations.","Take this course it is unlike any other course you will take. You will enjoy learning and growing in your physics understanding.","NO EXAMS NO EXAMS NO EXAMS. If you're like me and hate the usual memorization\/regurgitation based learning that goes on in science, this is the class for you. It's far more focused on actual learning and application than useless facts. <3 I LOVE THIS COURSE","Most painless way to kill the physics requirement if you're premed but don't expect to have much real knowledge of physics afterward, unless you work extra hard. I recommend that you start assignments early and seek out extra help\/resources if you want to really learn. The projects were pretty fun. Kelly is super helpful. The TFs were pretty hit or miss, find a TF that is really helpful and cling to them, even if they aren't assigned to you.","This is a different alternative to Physics 12 or 15. Students need to be self-motivated in order to succeed, and working as a team is essential to doing well. The projects are interesting but require substantial outside of class work, but for people who prefer hands-on learning or want to get into a design shop, this class is awesome.","It is a great course to broaden your physical knowledge and also to develop your teamwork skills.","This course can be difficult to schedule due to all of the group-based aspects. Regardless, it was such a great, low-stress, and straight-forward way to learn physics!","If you enjoy following orders or else being marked off because of it this is your course.  Yes you get to design projects, but that is such a small and easy part of the course that it does not dominate my view of this course.  Perhaps if there was an actual structure to the grading in this course rather than an arbitrary grading that you don't know what you will get on anything until it is returned this course would be more enjoyable.","This class is horrendous. \n\nIt focuses on the development of new teaching methods ('flipped classroom', 'online learning', 'applications focus'), under the assumption that they will be better and help students learn. The reality is that the new methods are ineffective and frustrating for us. The technology solves no problems, and instead creates new issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Mazur uses his students as guinea pigs in a flawed experiment, and you even feel like you are being watched as observers frequent the classroom. He collects data that makes his methods look good and seems unwilling to adapt the dysfunctional pieces of his course. \n\nAs for the course's content, understand that this course will not teach you physics. It will not even kind-of teach you physics. This is a remedial course for people who didn't do any kind of science in high school. There is no math. The textbook is atrocious, but the primary way you're supposed to learn in the course.The reality is that the one student in your group who took AP physics in high school will save your entire group, and the rest of students will leave the course as clueless as they came. \n\nAnd work? Well, that is the one redeeming thing about this course. You cannot fail to get an A. The work is extremely light, and doing it in groups guarantees that you never dip below an acceptable standard. A non-standard (3, 2, 1, where 2 is an A) grading system inflates your grade substantially. As a result, this class is filled with premeds.\n\nIf you care about learning physics, dislike group work, or hate premeds, do not take this course. In any other case, this class is harmless but a tremendous waste of money. \n\nEric Mazur should not be hailed for his teaching methods. They are a sham.","This course has a good heart, but is incredibly disorganized. I would wait a few years for the course to cement itself more before taking it.","When it comes down to it, if you are pre-med and have zero physics background, like I do, then you have two choices: PS 2 or AP50a. When narrowed down like this, the answer is pretty simple: AP50a. While the amount of time you will have to commit to this class can be downright daunting at times (~4 hours a week reading, many hours on psets, and group work), the grading system makes it all worth it because you are graded on effort and not accuracy. This takes the pressure WAY off and allows you to sit back and learn something for a change, which is nice. That being said, prepare for some tedious amount of reading and annotations, annoying teammates, and confused TFs. My best piece of advice for this class would be to just keep moving forward and not fall behind on reading annotations, be present during pset and RAAs (the closest thing to an exam in this class), and pray during the Expos that you don't look like an idiot.","Don't take this class if you really want to learn physics. The fact of the matter is that when you have three other classes that demand a lot from you, you aren't going to put the effort into this class. It's also so unorganized, which is frustrating.","Keep up with the readings. Find a method and stick to it.","If you put effort in on the readings and problem sets, it is not a difficult class.","This is a fantastic, hands on, project and team based course that is an easy time for both science concentrators and gen ed seekers alike. The course work is not difficult, but you learn a wide range of things, and traditional learning is thrown out the window. You really take control of what you learn, spend more time on doing than passive learning, and there are no lectures or section.","If you're reading this post trying to decide between PS2 or AP50a I'll break it down for you real quick. If you are a \"physic\/engineering\" person take PS2. You will not get the foundational physics you need in AP50a in order to excel in upper level physic\/engineering classes. If you are pre-med trying to get a good mark... take AP50a. It's honestly an enjoyable class. You will learn a bit about physics if you choose to and you will work on three cool projects. No exams. Problem Sets are graded on effort. Profs and TFs are really nice and cool. But you will not come away with the same physics foundation at PS2.","A great way to fill the Physics requirement if you don't want to get deep into the math behind it.","very different class structure, but extremely enjoyable, and a greater emphasis on learning","If you want a good grade and you're willing to put up with a LOT of annoying group work, you should do it. It's worth it if you put in the effort, but it's a huge pain if you go into it thinking it will be easy or that you can do it on your own. You have to really buy in to what the instructors believe to have a good time.","This is the best physics alternative if you want a fun class where you learn a good amount and is very easy grade-wise. Don't take it if you don't like working with teams or if you can't learn on your own.","Great class, the best part is learning to be a productive member of a team and have fun creating practical physics projects.","You need to be willing to work","The project-based teamwork component is the best part of this class and should honestly be a more common feature across all college courses. You get to learn a lot about yourself and working in a team. The 3 hour classes where you just work through problems at a glacial pace can be frustrating. But feeling like you walk away with very little new knowledge is rather disappointing, even if you got an A. This class is too easy to be good.","This is a great class if you are okay with working in groups! By far best way to fulfill physics requirement.","This is the best way to complete the physics requirement with one caveat: if you really like physics or really want to know  great deal of physics, this is not the class.","This class will get the requirement out of the way in a relatively fun way but you have to be incredibly driven to learn from the class.","I think that this is a good class for kids not very interesting in physics but either need to take a physics class or enjoy working on projects. I think for students actually interested in physics, the 12 or 15 tracks might be better.","Take it. It is much better than any alternative to fulfill recs you have and it is such a supportive environment. You'll have to self teach a bit, but you will learn. you will also have the satisfaction of building things with your bare hands and being proud of yourself.","To be honest, this class has a great concept and I was really enamored with the philosophy behind it - that we could actually learn physics through actual physics projects. However, the execution wasn't the best. The readings were not helpful, and we didn't really learn much in class. I would shop the other options, but it's likely that AP50 is the best option for pre-meds trying to fulfill the physics requirement.","This class was great. However, the material is difficult and even though I put in a lot of effort, I don't believe that I really learned much of the material, or could apply it outside of this class.","Don't take this if you don't want to spend a lot of time working on group projects outside of class.","If you are looking for an easy way to learn physics as a premed, take this class!! The projects and assignments can seem dumb at times, but if you do the work you will for sure get an A. Like I would be pissed if I got even an A- in this class. Honestly, I feel like I'm learning enough physics for the MCAT which is all I'll ever need physics for anyways so I don't really care that I'm not learning more advanced shit. Also you will not ever do hard math so don't worry about that.","Definitely take this course if you want to try working in teams and physically building tangible things. In terms of learning physics, not everything will stick (so if you're premed, maybe this isn't the course for you) but if you're interested in learning real world applications of physics.","It's definitely better than learning physics in a lecture based way, but it's still a physics class.","It's great to take if you aren't sure how strong you are with physics and is a nice alternative to the other introductory physics courses. That being said, the course is sometimes hard to manage when they have multiple components (quizzes, psets, group projects) with close deadlines, and some of the organizational issues can be frustrating. It's hard to tell how well you're doing in the course, and it's a lot of independent learning\/work to grasp physics concepts.","AP50a was an absolute joy. The teaching staff is fantastic and really makes this class more than just than a course, but an actual pleasant and enjoyable learning experience. The work is quite manageable, though some weeks are busier than others (there were some weeks that you had two reading assignments and the project proposal and contract due, and then a p-set due the following week; whereas other weeks, there were no assignments) so you do need to plan ahead (but this info is clearly detailed in the course syllabus-- including what activities we'll do in class for the semester). In addition, some of the work can be a little complex and not having lectures means that you need to do the learning by yourself. This is where office hours (and there were so many of them!) will come in handy but it's certainly the kind of thing that you will get out of it what you put into it. It really is worth putting in the time and if you do take this course, you should really strive to put in your full efforts!","The positives are: no final or exams, easy to get a good grade\nThe negatives are: you probably won't learn a lot of physics, group projects can be brutal\nIf you're the type of person who likes group projects and doesn't get stressed about getting thing done last minute, this is a good class for you. If you are a typical pre-med (like me) you will find this class frustrating.","You'll learn a lot in this class as long as you're willing to put in the effort!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"63","response rate":"87.30","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APPHY 50a","course_id":"1147","cat_num":"77155","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"11","4s":"23","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APPHY 50a","course_id":"1147","cat_num":"77155","1s":"5","2s":"16","3s":"52","4s":"9","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APPHY 50a","course_id":"1147","cat_num":"77155","1s":"1","2s":"32","3s":"12","4s":"4","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
