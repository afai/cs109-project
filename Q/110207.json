Do not take it if you want to learn about the issues facing India generally. It involves more social theory than you might think. Still was an interesting class!","If you're interested in the lives of the working class in India, I'd definitely take this class. The class is manageable and you will learn quite a bit from Shankar--he's quite relaxed and seems to know what he's talking about. The weekly responses are no big deals and the readings are not too dense. The films and skype calls we had also made for interesting learning. I'd probably go to more office hours if I could and engage with Shankar's book that is highlighted throughout the course even more. Keep your notes organized and do ask for feedback if you need."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SAS 196","course_id":"11391","cat_num":"63634","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SAS 196","course_id":"11391","cat_num":"63634","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SAS 196","course_id":"11391","cat_num":"63634","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
