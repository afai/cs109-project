It will benefit you more in the long run.","Please try to opt for a different expos class. The preceptor is fairly unresponsive and most time in class is spent on busy work\/writing while completely ignoring the overarching literary and historical background behind the slave narratives. For the writing aspect, you take literature and focus on seemingly inconsequential, precise aspects of it. The preceptor never really explains why we analyze these instead of overarching themes. In addition, I do not feel my writing improved--in fact, I had to write at a high school level again in order to get goods grades in this course.","While the class topic is great, the preceptor grades harshly. Don't expect to pad your GPA with this class.","Peter Becker is an amazing preceptor - he genuinely cares about the progress of his students' writing abilities and is also very knowledgeable about the content of the course (slave narratives and their modern interpretations). If you've never taken an African American class or don't plan to, take this for your expos requirement! It's so stimulating and rewarding. Personally, the main texts that we studied were an excellent choice, and taking this class has expanded the way I think about African American culture and literature. It was definitely a great experience - I HIGHLY recommend it. You will be challenged at times and pushed to think hard, but it helps with your writing.","This is a great expos class!  The subject matter is very interesting and allows you to learn to write through a history and literature lens.  I did not feel that I would have preferred to be in any other expos class.  Before choosing this class, I do recommend, however, that you read a bit of Toni Morrison's Beloved to see if you like it.  That book was hard for me to comprehend and engage with, and as a result, it made the second unit extremely challenging.","This course may not have the longest or most dense readings, but the grading is very difficult. It can be hard to tell how the preceptor will grade, since he does not provide a set rubric.","There is a lot of reading, but the reading is interesting! Professor Becker provides vert good feedback on drafts, but he expects a lot from you, and that you are on track with all the assignments. You also get to watch and analyze Django Unchained which was great!","Professor Becker is a demanding professor but he will ultimately help you become a better writer.","This class' syllabus and preceptor are amazing, but having a class with students who aren't enthusiastic or invested can really damage the experience","This is a very good class if you are interested in History and Literature, or just want to pursue something different.  There is a lot of reading - sometimes not the most exciting readings - but you will learn a lot and get a lot of help form Professor Becker.  He is awesome, chill, and always willing to lend a helping hand.  Professor Becker is awesome and thoughtful.","As is the case for many freshmen, I was a little apprehensive about taking Expos.  Contrary to what I had expected of an Expos course, I had a fantastic time in Slave Narratives. I not only got a very clear idea of what is expected of me in a college paper, I learned so much about American slavery.  On that subject, I was a little apprehensive about taking this particular course, because I had thought that I had already gotten a fair understanding of slavery.  I have been studying it since elementary school, and I thought it might be a dull subject because of that.  If anyone reading this has that same thought, I hope it does not deter you from taking the course, because I felt this class not only added a lot to my knowledge of American slavery, but the subject matter turned out to be extremely compelling, because it challenged some of my deeply-ingrained assumptions about slavery.  For instance, I learned about how white abolitionists were often extremely manipulative of how slaves could tell their personal stories.  I was also apprehensive about Expos because I heard a lot of complaints from people who had taken Expos in the fall about preceptors who wrote confusing and sparse comments on drafts.  In stark contrast, Dr. Becker was a wonderful preceptor who gave great and extensive feedback on written work.  I also thought his lessons both on writing and on the history of American slavery were extremely well-taught and effective.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I would definitely tell everyone trying to figure out what Expos to take to do slave narratives.","Enroll only if you are interested in Slave Narratives.","This class is absolutely amazing. Among my friends, I'm the only one I've heard say they genuinely love their expos section. Dr. Becker is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the material, and does a great job of teaching you how to approach the material, do in-depth close readings and write effective essays. If you are very analytical or enjoy literature analysis, this class is for you! Even as a STEM concentrator, it has been one of my favorite classes thus far at Harvard. Grading is also very fair in my experience, especially compared to other expos sections. If you have the chance, definitely takes this as your expos class.","Slave Narratives is far and away the best expos class.  Dr. Becker is extremely engaging, so conscientious and just all-around the best preceptor.  He lays out the course extremely well, gives great feedback, and does not assign too much work.  If anything, the materials and the assignments that he gives make you want to work hard and do well.  I cannot recommend this course enough.  Slave Narratives is without a doubt the expos to take.","Dr. Becker runs this class exactly the way an introductory writing class should be run. He does not demand too much reading and always gives great feedback on your essays and work. I never had to spend a lot of time on this course but I learned a lot.","The readings for this Expos are very interesting and Dr. Becker is a really great professor. As far as expos go this is a very helpful and interesting course to take.","This is a really interesting Expos course! You get to work with good and meaningful texts and the atmosphere is relaxed."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.221","course_id":"10609","cat_num":"61846","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.221","course_id":"10609","cat_num":"61846","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.221","course_id":"10609","cat_num":"61846","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
