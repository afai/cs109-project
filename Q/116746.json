'07":{"comments":["Only for those that want to work really, really hard!","Arabic is a beautiful language--if you'd like to learn a beautiful language, a beautiful script, learn about a beautiful culture, and\/or hope to travel to an Arabic-speaking at some point in your life (hopefully the near future), I highly recommend this course!","It's a lot of work, but it's totally worth it.","It's challenging but also extremely stimulating and interesting.","I would do the research on which teacher you chose.  Some of the teachers work you very hard but you'll learn a lot","The first month is very tough if you have no background in Arabic, and you have to work very hard to keep up all semester.","If you work hard in this class, do your homework, listen to the DVDs, and memorize the vocabulary, you will be amazed at how much Arabic you will learn in only the first semester.","It's a lot of work, but definitely worthwhile","There is no better place in the world to learn a language, and I believe that  Arabic is no exception. I felt that my professor and TF truly cared about my progress as a student and made sure I was always learning and improving. The atmosphere in the class was also fun. The beginning was very tough, but it became more manageable over time. I would absolutely tell anyone with any interest in learning a new language to take Arabic.","Tough, but satisfying.","I would tell future students that it is a course that requires a lot of studying but that if they learn to manage their time, they won't feel overwhelmed. I would also tell them that having the homework assignments completed on time is crucial because the next day's classwork will usually be a review or an addition to the things completed the night before. I would also tell them to take the course with my professor because he is very patient and always willing to answer our questions.","You have to work real hard and basically teach yourself the language.","You have to have faith that things will ultimately make sense. Sometimes we're told \"you'll learn this later but that it's good to recognize this now\". So many things are just memorization at this time.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class on this language. If you haven't been exposed to Arabic before, make sure the rest of your course load is light; this will take up most of your time on a daily basis if you hope to  do well.","It's awesome if you love to learn languages i.e. memorize vocab, conjugate verbs, learn grammar. There are a lot of daily assignments but they're necessary and helpful.","Arabic is a challenging language to learn, but the process is a great mental exercise, different from learning say French or Spanish. The practical benefits of learning the language obviously depend on the person.","Arabic is an important language to learn, and this introduction class is quite well-taught.","Arabic A is an amazing class, and you will actually see yourself making notable progress, even after one semester.","you absolutely must be committed to studying arabic. it requires two hours of preparation each night and extra study on the weekends.","It requires a huge time commitment and is very fast-paced.","great effort is required throughout the year, but the return is tremendous. unlike many other courses at Harvard, you get to witness your own improvement week  by week.","take it only if you have a love of language, as it requires a lot of mundane drilling and memorization.","While the course is not difficult persay, it requires a big time commitment.","It is a demanding course, but if you enjoy studying languages, it is an excellent choice.","You learn an interesting language with a whole interesting mix of people.  Graduate students, MIT kids, and others make it fun and interesting.","The course is worthwhile and the language is fun to learn. Be prepared to slave away for the first month, and perhaps consider finding additional books or Web resources to supplement the abysmal textbook.","This class is wonderful.  You get to wrestle with a difficult yet highly rewarding language in a fairly intimate setting while being surrounded by students from many different backgrounds and taught by fascinating and helpful people.","Its a good class, but way too time consuming for graduate students and people who are not majoring in languages.","I is a good class but you should not expect to have a lot of work to do outside of class if you have a good memory or a natural ability with languages.","It's a fun class and a great introduction to Arabic, a beautiful language!","This is not as easy as high school language classes.  You will actually be expected to learn the language and do home work on a very regular basis.  It will take a healthy number of hours out of your week.\r\nIt will also teach you basic arabic.  Do not come to this class looking for a lot of culture though.","only take it if you are really committed to learning arabic.","Only take this course if you're serious about learning Arabic and you know that you will work hard in the course.  If you want to do well, it definitely takes a lot of time and commitment (not to mention getting up early 5x a week) so only do it if you are genuinely interested in the language and culture.","This is a beautiful language and a good into to MSA.","Be prepared to spend time on this course and having difficulty mastering the vocabulary.  It is better to take the course if you are only taking 4 courses in total (I had 5.5 courses which was a bit too much)!","If you want to learn Arabic, this is a good place to be.  The course flows and you are constantly learning new things.  It is not so heavy on the grammar or cultural aspects of Arabic, but for a solid base in modern fuscha - it's a really good choice.  Have fun!","You'll learn Arabic very quickly and very solidly if you're willing to put in the consistent hard work that the course requires.","quite a bit of work, but a very rewarding class","This class is my favorite class. It is demanding but very interesting. The pace is rapid which enables us to see progress.","Professor Atamnia creates a conducive learning environment for the class, his enthusiasm and teaching will encourage you to learn the material and inspire you to perfect the Arabic language.","This class is a great way to get an interesting introduction to the Arabic language and the culture of Arabic-speaking countries.  I had a lot of fun in this class, and the workload was substantial but relatively painless.","It is a great class.  It requires an immense dedication, but it is a rewarding language.","Arabic is important but tough.","I would recommend this class to those who need to fulfill a concentration requirement or who have a strong interest in Arabic. I would not recommend this class to those who need to fulfill a language requirement, since the slow pace of first year Arabic means that students are unlikely to come away with a great deal of useful knowledge after only one year of study."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["Take very good notes because you will not be able to study for a test using just the book.","This course requires a lot of time and effort but, the professors are always available, especially Professor Mostafa, and willing to help. Homework assignments aren't too difficult but they are necessary since it is the one way to see if you understand the concepts that were learned in class. It may seem like a lot in terms of new vocabulary, grammar rules, etc. but, you will feel more than accomplished when in the end, you can hold a good 15 minute conversation with a native arabic speaker","Very good way to discipline yourself to learn Arabic. The small group sizes make it perfect to practice speaking. The pace of the course is quite slow, but that's fine if you are busy with other things anyway.","It is an enormous time commitment and you have to be motivated to learn the material. Otherwise, you will fall behind easily.","It is an interesting and productive course if you are willing to put the time in.  If you are uncertain about the time commitment, don't take the course.","The professor, Mostafa, is fantastic.  Sometimes during class when we would be speaking in pairs, he would excuse himself, go smoke a cig in two minutes and come back even more jovial","Its hard, but very worth it.","Take it Prof. Al-Masri","You will learn quite a bit.","This class is a great exercise in learning a new language and in beginning to appreciate a new culture.","If you have the time to invest, this class can be very rewarding.","My absolute favorite class so far.  Because of this class, I am considering concentrating in NELC and I loved almost every minute of this class.  A great learning opportunity and it is such a cool language to learn.","The focus of the class is on Arabic grammar, but you will leave with a very limited vocabulary, even for an introductory language course. Compared to other intro language courses at Harvard, the course is not very fast-paced.","If you want to learn Arabic, this is the way to do it.  The more work you put in, the more you get out -- but no matter what, you will get something out.  And it will be Arabic.","Don't take this course unless you truly have the time to devote to it.  You will spend more than 4 hours per day with Arabic (including class time) if you want to succeed.","The most challenging weeks in Arabic A were in the beginning of both semesters.  Don't entirely give up on the class after the first few weeks, since the workload diminishes significantly afterwards.","Too much homework, terrible textbook, good instructor. A grind.","If you're interested in arabic, take it!","the language is beautiful and i fell in love with the region because of it, but it takes up a lot of your time and you have to be willing to put a lot of work into it.","I would recommend this class if you anticipate having a lot of time to devote to the class and really wish to invest many years into the language to gain mastery.","Be prepared to study.","The most work you will have, EVER, but still worth it.... and that is a lot considering it was a 9 am section","I would recommend to take the class if you have a genuine desire to learn arabic and continue studying it in the years following.","Good introduction to Arabic, and a fun class","Be prepared for plenty of hard work if you'd like to come away with the class with a good foundation in Arabic. At the same time, if you're prepared to work hard, you'll be well cared-for.","Arabic A might well be the most challenging language class you will ever take, but when you understand the first Arabic sentence on the street, on television, or in the dining hall, it will all be worth it.","I would recommend this course provided that it is made less dependent on Al-Kitaab.","Arabic is a beautiful language and is worth the hard work.","Make sure you have time and are dedicated to it before deciding to enroll.  It will take time and will sometimes be frustrating as you don't always remember everything you learn.","A gerat way to learn beginning arabic but by no means an easy course.","It was my favorite course this year, by far. It was a great deal of work but the amount that we learned is incredible. The personal attention and small class size really helped creative a good learning environment.","You have to be very dedicated to studying Arabic. It requires an above-and-beyond amount of daily preparation and long-term work. The class is rewarding, but utterly brutal.","Very difficult but very rewarding.","You'll learn Arabic but it's a tough slog.","Takes a lot of hard work but you learn a lot in the class."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["This class is challenging but well worth it. You learn a lot in just a short stretch of time.","This class is a fun and interesting way to learn Arabic, and I highly recommend taking Arabic as a language.","Don't be intimidated! The teaching is great and it's lots of fun!","The Arabic program at Harvard is just excellent.","This was a great class.  I really enjoyed learning the language and the classroom atmosphere.  I recommend the course and the teachers wholeheartedly.","You MUST stay on top of the vocabulary if you want to succeed in this class. It requires a lot of independent study to succeed, but the section leaders and professors are very willing to help if you seek them out through office hours.","This class is a great foundation course for anyone interested in learning about the Arabic language, culture, and customs.","The class is a lot of work, but if you put the time into it you will learn a lot.","I would recommend this class to people who really want to study Arabic and who are willing to do the work. One of my roommates wants to take Arabic as something random because she finds it interesting. Someone who wants to do that will not be willing to do the tremendous amount of work required and will begin to hate the class. The class is excellent for someone who is serious about learning Arabic and willing to do the work.","Definitely go into the class being excited to learn the material- there's a lot of it!","It is a great course if you are very keen to learn Arabic but it is very hard work and time consuming.","Daily assignments are not enough to master the language; additional review is necessary.","Arabic will give students an excellent foundation to the language however they must be prepared for a very demanding schedule and workload.","This class is an engaging and fun way to pick up not only an important language, but also to learn a bit of the culture of different Arabic countries. Even if a student never continues past the introductory level, he or she will have learned enough of the language to be able to communicate with other Arabic speakers.","You should know what you're getting into. It's not easy by any means, but if you actually put the work in and make the effort every day, it's extremely rewarding.","Take the course with Mostafa!  He is wonderful!","expect to work very hard, but foreign language is probably the most useful type of class you can possibly take.","Arabic A requires that you put in a great deal of work, but learning a new language is always rewarding.","Mostafa is AWESOME.","For students interested in learning Arabic, Arabic A provides a great introduction to the language.  That said, learning Arabic is very challenging, and I would caution students who half-heartedly think it would be a cool thing to know from taking the course.","This is a very good class - it is fun and very applicable to life.","Arabic is an interesting language, but there is certainly a proportion between how much work you're willing to do outside of the class to the level of reward and learning you experience.","Wait until they stop using Maha.","you should take this course only if you are willing and want to learn the language.","This was my favorite class, by far. Even the tests were enjoyable.","I don't feel that Arabic is a language for everyone to take, especially since elementary Arabic is formal, modern-standard Arabic. This means that if you really wanted to be able to speak with Arabic speakers at a comprehensive level, you would need to take MSA Arabic for a minimum of two years before you could take a colloquial class and learn the way that people actually speak the language.","Make sure you really want to learn Arabic for life - do not attempt just \"for fun\" unless you are a skilled linguist!","This is absolutely the best class I've ever taken!  The professor is amazing, the class is fun, the students build a true sense of community, the assignments are interesting, and I've learned so much Arabic in one semester!  I love it!  I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks he or she might be interested with no reservations.","Arabic A is great, obviously only if you really want to learn Arabic. It is very difficult, but totally manageable and fair if you put in the work. It is also much more satisfying, at least to me, that romance and other languages that are closely related to english.","Be prepared to put in time.","Arabic is very demanding but rewarding and enjoyable at the same time. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to learn so much material that at the beginning of the term seemed very daunting.","I would recommend the course for anyone who is absolutely committed to learning Arabic for personal or professional reasons. My reservations would be that it is such an intense time commitment that a student should be prepared to make other course and time sacrifices to be able to meet the demands of this course.","Mostafa Atamnia is one of the best professors at Harvard. He is amazingly helpful and responsive. He is enthusiastic, funny, and keeps expectations high.\r\n\r\nHowever, there will be people in the class who have extensive knowledge of Middle Eastern languages. These people tend to be favorites and make the class more intimidating. You may question your own abilities. However, you cannot compare yourself to these people. They simply have more experience with these kinds of languages.","Arabic's a wonderful language to learn, and the Harvard Arabic department is wonderful.","Be prepared to spend at least 1-2 hours per day working on this class.  Once you fall behind it is very difficult to catch up.","Practically nothing I would have to say would be applicable as I'm guessing the experience varies among instructors; but it's a good deal of fun.","It's a lot of time, but it's effective. I can have simple conversations with my Arab friends after just one semester.","Make sure you study the vocabulary every night. Falling behind on the vocabulary makes the class extremely difficult.","It is incredibly time consuming, and very difficult. But you learn a ton and are surprised by how much of the language you can acquire in the first semester.","You should take advantage of the language program at Harvard, Arabic in particular is taught with absolute excellence","Be careful about staying on track. And get all the info about tests and time given.","My favorite class this semester; a great foreign language to study.","It's a wonderful opportunity to study Arabic with a dedicated teacher. however, be prepared to put in a LOT of work.","Fun but challenging; wonderful professor but in general the class and text book feel a little confusing and disorganized","You should be prepared to work hard.","Elementary Arabic is a great course, but it has a heavy homework load...

Taking on a non-romance-language is a VERY study-heavy obligation, so be weary of taking this class on a whim ESPECIALLY because you can't get out of it at the semester. Am I glad that I was forced to stay in it past the semester? Yes. But I do know some people suffered immensely because they were. ALSO if you're looking to be able to converse in Arabic like any normal person, know that you're looking at a TWO YEAR commitment before you can even BEGIN to take a form of Arabic people ACTUALLY speak in.","This class is certainly difficult, but it is much more rewarding.

It is probably the only time in your life that you will have the kind of time and resources that are available to you at Harvard to learn a language. Arabic is particularly well-taught. Not only is it a fascinating language, the instructors (or at least the two I have had) are excellent, engaged with the students, and enthusiastic for the class. In addition, you really LEARN a new language, who wouldn't want to do that?","not the easiest way to fulfill a language requirement","I would tell them that it is the most work they will have for a class.

However I would warn students that it takes up a lot of time and is difficult.","William Butler Yeats said, \"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.\" Not only is this course very much the filling of a pail, its water has utterly drenched my fire. Arabic is almost entirely about memorizing the words, which is utterly uninspiring.","Wonderful because you learn so much so fast, and one of the best programs in the country. But a huge daily grind and extremely difficult.","If you want to learn Arabic at any point in your life, do it at Harvard. The teachers are outstanding, and they make an insanely complicated language seem at least doable.","This is a fun and interesting class!","Study constantly. Or at least review vocabulary weekly.","It is rewarding but requires a lot of work.","don't take this class if you already have a large workload.  It is not a pushover elective. Also, it is difficult to see results from the first year because your language level is so elementary, and modern standard arabic isn't used anywhere, so you can't even communicate with others if you were to go abroad.","The course provides a manageable approach to learning an unfamiliar language.  Learning Arabic requires a great deal of work but is entirely possible.","This class requires a great deal of outside work and commitment","It will kick your ass harder than you ever thought possible and you will stress and you may even cry, but at the end of the year you'll be happy you took it...maybe...","Don't be scared! You hear a lot of stories about how hard Arabic is, but the class is taught very well.","if you can't devote 2 hours a day to the class it will be very difficult to keep up.","Recommend if willing to commit.","To make sure they take it with Professor Atamnia.","It was pretty good and I can form some complete sentences","It's a ton of work.

It's very hard though.","You have to really want to learn the language to be able to consistently do all the work required by it.","Arabic A is a very tough class, but well worth the effort if you can stick with it.","This class is an excellent introduction to the Arabic language, and you will learn to construct sentences with ease. I have learned more in two semesters of Arabic than I learned in the first four years of studying foreign language in high school.","It gets really hard to go to class 5 days a week, but it is worth it!","If you want a solid introduction to Arabic and are starting with little to no knowledge of the subject, this is the perfect class for you. Be forewarned, however, that the Arabic taught in this course is not what you will hear on the streets of many Arab countries - learning dialects will take many additional years of practice.","The Arabic program at Harvard is just GREAT!","Be prepared to do a significant amount of work ... it should be your top priority class.","I would say Arabic requires a significant time commitment and is a course that requires a new way of learning the language rather than the traditional approach.

I am so excited to keep taking Arabic.  Best class here.","I already knew how to write the script but that level of knowledge is covered withing about 3 weeks. The pace is pretty fast, so you still learn a lot, but its manageable as well.

Also, entirely different from English.\r\nAdditionally, the script looks very elegant, which I actually found to be a concrete benefit.","This is an excellent class. Though it is a lot of work, in my opinion learning the beautiful and intriguing language of Arabic is worth it. Mostafa and Luke pushed us, but they were such good teachers that what they expected was well within our abilities.

The year-long requirement may be intimidating, but it means that you generally stay with the same preceptor, TF, class, and section the whole year, which creates a community feeling. The tests are generally good at testing what you've learned, though they occasionally slip in vocabulary or concepts that have been mentioned only tangentially or extremely informally in class. The information and lessons don't usually come in a very structured way in class, so I would recommend some sort of mechanism for organizing it. You should also know coming in that the Arabic you will learn in this class is overwhelmingly Modern Standard, which isn't actually what Arabic-speaking people speak in for their day-to-day lives, although it definitely helps you learn the different colloquialized Arabics that people do speak.

Arabic is considered a \"critical language\" and it can open up a lot of doors. Only take this class if you are committed to the language and serious about taking more Arabic classes in the future. If you only take one year of Arabic and then stop, you won't get much out of it.","This class is simply the best way to begin learning Arabic.","This is a class where you really get what you give. If you put in the time and effort you will surprise yourself with how much you know!","while this course is EXTREMELY challenging, you will spend many long hours on your homework and studying for exams, it is as equally fulfilling. you will be able to speak, read, and understand an amazing amount of arabic after only 2 semesters worth of classes.","You will learn a lot, but sometimes at the expense of your self-confidence. I struggled a lot in this class environment (it was too intense for me).","This class is difficult in terms of workload but very doable and very worth taking. It is well-taught and gives one a firm foundation for future studies in Arabic. Don't take this if you fear nightly, time-consuming homework.","The textbook is horrible, and your general experience in the class will greatly depend on you professor and your TF, both of whom are extremely unlikely to be native Arabic speakers.","TAKE ARABIC. The class, the professors, the students are all amazing--there's a real sense of community among the first year Arabic students and it was my most enjoyable class the whole year.","Be prepared for a daily grind. The course is infinitely better if you reach out to your classmates and establish an Arabic A community. Get breakfast together after class. Make a study group. Also, do go to the language table in Kirkland on Tuesday nights.","Mostafa was an AMAZING teacher. I had him my second semester, and with his teaching, I found myself spending very little time needing to review the material at home. His teaching is that effective. I don't know why they are letting him leave. I also had Khaled 1st semester, and felt he didn't really care about the class and cared more about his higher level classes. As for class in general, I love the language and have a knack for acquiring languages so it was pretty easy for me. My friends sometimes complained about how touch it was, but I always found it manageable. I spent maybe an hour or less per night on the material. But this class is so worth taking if you're passionate about the language!!! Also, on a general note, don't hesitate to shop sections--teaching methods vary more than you'd think here in Harvard, not just in Arabic but all courses.","Arabic is hard. And this Arabic A class is hard - five days of class a week, at least an hour of homework every night, frequent tests and quizzes. But! You will learn so much in a year! And Arabic is a beautiful and fascinating language. Especially once you begin to understand the root system, learning the language becomes so exciting- suddenly etymology and grammar become the same. If you're on the fence about Arabic, but willing to commit time and effort, take it!","very hard unless you have to take it don't take it.","Arabic is a very useful and the only tool for familiarizing oneself with a world that is mostly misunderstood or misinterpreted. It is only after I started to learn Arabic that I could approach many news with a critical eye.","You should learn Arabic, it is fun.","This is a very difficult course. Only take if you want to pursue a future in Arabic language.","It's hard work, but Arabic is a fun language to learn, especially if you are interested in the Middle East.","The first thing to know is that Arabic is not something to be intimidated by, at all. Yes, work is required--but that means that you're learning. More importantly, the kind of work required is a wonderful break from papers or p-sets: it's mindless, rote memorization that you can pick up at anytime. \r\nOtherwise, you'll find classes get really tight, and that some professors are better than others. Take the class if you're interested in a new language and culture, but don't expect a walk in the park.","It's a pity that you won't be learning with Mostafa Atamnia and Nuri Friedlander next year.","TAKE IT!","This was one of the most fun classes I've taken because the class is very engaging and everyone who's taking it is doing so because they want to learn Arabic.","This class is very hard, but also extremely rewarding. The TFs and lecturers are some of the best I had all year and are very mindful of your needs. The work can seem like a lot at times, but it's worth it when you start seeing measurable progress in your Arabic skills. Definitely worth taking if you're interested in learning a foreign language.","Arabic language skills are practical, rewarding, and relevant to many careers. This course offers a solid foundation in Arabic, and students should not be deterred by the fact that it is more challenging than most language courses.","This class is a lot of work.","This was a great introduction to Arabic and has definitely convinced me to continue with the langauge for the next three years and possibly concentrate in NELC.","This was a very good introductory Arabic class and I can say with confidence that the reasons for that were David Karjala and Ahmad. By far the best professor and TF I've had at my time here. They make learning the language lots of fun.","This course is a great intro to Arabic but requires substantial work during the week.","1. Understand that Arabic is a commitment.\r\n2. Make flashcards from day 1. Carry them with you everywhere.\r\n3. Do everything you can to get a good section.\r\n4. Get your homework down early and review it every week.\r\n\r\nArabic is a commitment. A fun one but not one which can be taken lightly. You'll have to love it to do well.","Harvard has an excellent Arabic program, but make sure you're ready to work hard because the class is a significant time commitment","It is a difficult but rewarding class.","If you want to learn Arabic, I would definitely, definitely recommend taking Arabic at Harvard. It is extremely well taught and I can't believe how much grammar and vocabulary was covered in just one year. I almost didn't take this course because I'm a senior, but I'm so glad I did - I feel like I have a really solid foundation in elementary Arabic that I can always go back and build on later.\r\n\r\nJust be prepared to work very hard. This is not an easy class. The language itself is not as difficult as many people think it is-- but it does require a lot of work and you have to keep up with all the homework assignments and put a lot of time into them because if you get behind you're screwed.","Since the class meets everyday the homework can be a bit time consuming but it definitely helps you learn and retain the lessons. No prior experience is necessary to take this great course. I highly recommend this course!","Find out who is teaching the class and who the section leaders will be and find out whether those individuals in particular are good at teaching; choose the class based on what instructor\/preceptor and what section leader you will have.","This is a great class! Definitely take it even if you have no background whatsoever with the language; if you want to learn it and are willing to put in the effort, you will get a ton out of the course.  It can be a challenge, but it's one of those good kinds of challenges that keeps you interested and motivated, and there is plenty of support available if you're struggling.  I always really had fun with Arabic A.  Get Khalid (Paul) Wulfsberg if you can.","Yes, it may seem silly at times to learn a version of Arabic that isn't really spoken by the public, but this is an well-taught course that is definitely worth taking if you're even remotely interested in the language. David Karjala's section was great, and I don't have much experience with the other professors. He did a good job of teaching us exactly what we needed to know, and tests weren't really a surprise. I suggest you keep up with the vocabulary, and don't just forget it after the test, and that will make your life a lot easier.","make no mistake about the course's difficulty, but it's very effective","Arabic's intimidating. Just do it.","The second half of Arabic A has all the good qualities of the first plus a little more listening\/oral work. It is worth taking but only if you continue in future years. After a year of Arabic you are nowhere close to fluent (due to the nature of Arabic, not the course itself) and taking just Arabic A is a poor strategic choice for this reason. However, for an intro course to Arabic, I don't think you can do much better than Harvard's class. Very well done.","If you want to learn Arabic then go for it, but it will be difficult and time consuming.","Be wary, it takes up lots of time. But it is one of my favorite classes."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Wulfsberg is an excellent professor. His strongest asset is, I think, that he  never moves on before every student has understood.","This is an incredible course.  Arabic is beautiful, and when you realize you can read it (at least phonetically) it will blow your mind.","Be prepared to invest time but rest assured that it will pay off.","Arabic is taught very well and you learn the language pretty well. It takes time that you have to spend consistently, but not an overall difficult thing.","Make sure you invest in the day-to-day work of the course and try to stay on top of all the vocabulary. Practice with the writing, especially in learning the vocabulary, and it will help reading and discussion a lot.","This class is incredibly hard, but it is even more rewarding.","Arabic is a beautiful and wonderful language to learn.","Having class daily is tough, especially when you have other commitments that may occur on the same day (for example, if you have problem sets due every Friday and stay up all night to complete them, you will also have an Arabic quiz that day. Very tough to manage). The course staff is very helpful and accessible, and the teachers are amazing. If you have the time to take it, do! It's worth it.","It is a real challenge but the sense of satisfaction by the end of the first semester is great. Just be prepared to put in a lot of time to get good results. Outstanding teaching and a really good pace of progress.","This is a great language and it is taught very well.","It is extremely difficult and should not be taken as any easy way to fulfill the language requirement. It is also extremely rewarding and an important language to learn if you are willing to put in the effort.","I worked on Arabic about 6 days a week this past semester. DO NOT take this class if you do not have time for it.\r\nIf you do...wow. Get ready to have a lot of fun!! This was my hardest (just in terms of workload, if you work hard you will definitely learn the language) AND my favorite class this year.","The focus is more on writing than on speaking, but both skills are thoroughly developed.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time learning this language (especially in the beginning), but given the regular meeting hours and the excellent instructors, you will be sure to acquire solid skills in reading, writing, and conversing.","It's not the easiest language, but taking the time to learn it is very important given the increasing importance of the Arab World in global politics.","A great class with lots of support; you need to be committed to putting in a lot of time, however.","YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. It's very well taught, you will learn a lot, etc.","If you really want to learn Arabic then take it, otherwise, take an easier language","This class is amazing! I hope you have Paul and Ali. They're a great team and the class is taught very well!","Arabic is difficult, there is no question about it. There is a lot of homework, and even if you think of yourself as being good with languages, if you've never dealt with the Semitic family before, it is tough going into a language that has very few cognates in common with English and different syntactical arrangements. That said, if you really want to learn the language and are willing to put the work in, you will learn a lot. I did!","This is a challenging class, but very efficient and effective. We've improved quickly in the language and already, after just one semester, are able write and talk quite freely about our daily routine, courses, family, work, hometowns, favorite foods, favorite places, and other subjects. The class provides a strong foundation in a difficult language.","Lots of vocab words but it is unbelievably rewarding, and you'll never regret it. take it if you're a consistent worker","The class requires a lot of time and effort but in the way that it expands your way of thinking and challenges you is very much worth the time commitment, but it is exhausting and therefore should not be mixed with too many other hard classes.","This is a great course with kind and understanding teachers who want you to learn and succeed. They have an enthusiasm for the language, and are very accessible outside of class. This was the highlight of my day!","This is not an easy class, but taking Arabic was one of the best decisions I've made since coming here, and my only regret is that I didn't start taking it earlier. If you can commit at least an hour and a half a day to homework (and only homework), you can definitely handle this course. But, it is a regular commitment: you'll be doing that homework every day. Take the effort to go to office hours early and understand the basics. You'll feel disheartened around the middle of the course: don't give up! As long as you have good teachers (and there are a few very good teachers) and don't fall behind\/make flash cards, this is manageable and wonderful.","I love the fact that the courses is conducted in small section, which much personal attention and interaction with the instructors. The instructors are really engaging and always come up with novel and fun activities for us! \r\nBut be aware. This is an extremely difficult class. If you want to do well in this class, you must be prepared to put in about 2 hours of time per day for Arabic. That said, this class is really one of the most awesome introductory class that gives you a sneak preview at one of the world's hardest language.","Wait to take it until the teaching staff have a better idea of how to teach with the new textbook, or until they switch back to the old textbook.","Arabic is definitely a challenging language, but it's exciting to learn. It takes a lot of commitment, but it pays off.","If you want to take this course, you need to have a reason other than \"it sounds fun.\" It is not fun. It is challenging and rewarding and will be very useful for me personally, but the class is rarely \"fun.\" Though we laugh at the Arabic customs and the awkward movies, the language is very complicated and tries my patience often.","Take it seriously, work hard and everything should work out well enough, inshaAllah :) Dalia and Leonard are amazing teachers. Don't be afraid to ask questions, get help often and get it SOON.","Arabic A, in my opinion, is a tough class. You'll consistently have 2-3 hours of homework a night, and sometime it's hard to understand the material\/concepts being thrown at you. If you really want to learn Arabic, it's a very good, worthwhile class. If you just want to get your language requirement out of the way, or just want to try something new on a whim, you might be better off trying another, easier language.","Considering half the people in my section came from an Arabic-speaking country or family, knew Urdu, or already spoke an Arabic dialect, please take the word \"beginner\" in the title with a grain of salt. Just make sure you have a good reason for taking it, so when it gets hard you actually have something to motivate you to keep learning. Also, the textbook is awful, so maybe buy another one as a backup.","Variable depending on the instructors. I felt that both of the instructors served the class exceptionally well.","Great class! You learn a lot really quickly :) good luck....","Feryal is a great instructor; she genuinely wants to see her students learn and is willing to take the extra steps to follow through with that. You will get back from this class as much as you put into it. It is a big time commitment and the grammar component is difficult and confusing.","This class is demanding but incredibly rewarding if you put in the time every day. The teaching staff is compassionate and invested in its students. Go to office hours as much as possible! This class incorporates cultural teachings (helpful for people interested in the Middle East), exercises your mind, and introduces you to excellent people. You will learn quickly and be surprised by your progress at the end of the semester. I feel like I have basic conversation skills that I could apply after only four months of being exposed to the language.","My preceptor (Dalia) was amazing. I decided to take arabic after shopping her section one day, sort of by chance. She was able to speak completely in arabic while allowing us to grasp what she was saying and learn the words and concepts she was employing. I don't know if I'm going to end up concentrating in Arabic or NELC at all, but so far the teachers have made the language so interesting, and it's unbelievable how much I've learned in such a short amount of time.","The class is what you make out of it. If you put in the necessary effort you will learn a new language quite easily and well.","It's a great class but almost everyone is too optimistic about their language ability before taking it. I couldn't improve the teacher or class at all but I still won't be able to speak Arabic after this, or maybe ever, because it's just that hard.","This course is an excellent way to get started with Arabic. You have to do tons of work but you do learn a lot at a rapid pace if you have the motivation to put in the hours.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is such a hard language that one year alone probably won't get you very far. And to do well you need to really be motivated to learn the language; if you just treat it like any other class with specific delineated assignments then you won't learn. I think Arabic needs to be a high priority if you are going to take it and do well.","I loved this class. It's so so liberating to learn another alphabet, especially one that goes the opposite direction and is so pretty! Arabic is a really hard language, but Paul and Ali made it a really fun time, and even after staying up til 4am or later working on p-sets, waking up at 10am for this class set every day of my first semester at Harvard off to an awesome start and I'm so thankful for that. It's so much fun!","Very hard, but quite rewarding.","A lot of hard work, but you get SO much out of it.","This class is hard.  If you have a passion for learning Arabic, take it.  Nuri is an incredible teacher, so it Nicola.  This class has kicked my butt, but I absolutely loved it.  You developed a great relationship with the teachers and the other students in you section.","If you want to learn Arabic, you will learn Arabic.","This is a solid course; you learn very quickly the alphabet and writing process and how to speak in the simple past and present. Its surprising to look back at the end of the semester and see how much you've learned.","Excellent course, very well taught and well planned. Be prepared to work consistently. Doing a little bit every day is really the key to doing well in this course.","Arabic is really hard, obviously, but this class does a great job at teaching you a lot pretty quickly. Sometimes it's a bit discouraging but at the end you realize that you can already read, write, and speak a lot and there's definitely a lot of help in the professors and TFs.","If you genuinely want to learn arabic, take it its a great class.  But if you are not sure it is a huge commitment."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["All professors are really dedicated. It will definitely be a time commitment, but manageable in the end. Find a friend who speaks Arabic and practice with them. This can not be taken as an easy 5th class. You non the less learn a ton of stuff in a very short tie frame.","Definitely keep up with the day to day work and the new vocabulary. You learn a lot, but the course is made a lot easier by keeping up to speed with everything. Also, definitely go to office hours when you can. The teaching staff is great and friendly and office hours are a great place for you to practice your speaking ability.","This course is very time-consuming. Go to office hours. Make flash cards for vocabulart. Listen to audio files over and over. You will be somewhat conversational at the end of the year and be able to read; the speed of this course is quite impressive and you learn a lot in a short amount of time. Find study groups.","Take Arabic if you are interested in anything having to do with the arab world (culture, history, politics, religion)... just don't count on it being a 'fun' or 'easy' language per say.","If you really want to learn Arabic and pursue it in the future, this is a solid introductory course. If you want to try a new foreign language to see if you like it, or you just need to fulfill your foreign language requirement and don't want to go further in Arabic, I would recommend not taking it.","It's a great introduction to the Arabic language","Learning how to read, write, speak, and listen to Arabic is the most rewarding thing you could do in one year at Harvard, and you will do all these at a very high level. It's an every-day class, but it's soo worth it, trust me. I basically urge all of my friends (or at least the ones I like) to take this course. Just ask yourself, don't you want to be able to read that beautiful Arabic script?? It may be easier than you think :)","This class was the highlight of my day everyday. Not only is the language and culture fascinating, but the way in which it is taught is straightforward and easy to follow.","The class was wonderful and I absolutely loved it. However, I also spent many late nights (particularly first semester) studying and doing homework for this class and still not remembering everything I needed to. Arabic is a difficult but very rewarding language.","This class made me happy every time I went there. The work I provided was always rewarded. the teachers are very nice, and I strongly recommend the class !","You have to be willing to put in a TON of time, but if you are, it's worth it.","This class is not for the faint of heart - it is not hard as much as it is a lot of daily work - a daily grind. You really learn the language, and are lucky to have some of the most dedicated teaching staff at the University.","An excellent introduction to Arabic. The first semester may not have been be very exciting, but the second semester is extremely rewarding. For a beginner level course, the amount of Arabic we learn is very impressive.","Only take this class if you are serious about learning Arabic. If you are looking for a class to fill your language requirement easily, this isn't the class for you, but if you're willing to put in the hours and actually study you'll find it rewarding.","Take this class because it is so freaking awesome!!!\r\nSeriously an experience in a language class is very different from that of other classes. You get to meet your friends and professor everyday for almost a year. The friendships made will certainly last a long time. \r\nArabic is very well-taught at Harvard too. I was initially afraid of taking one of the toughest languages (I am a language idiot) but I really find that the pace of the class was right and there are many avenues of help available. As long as you are willing to spend some time (about 1-2 hours per day to review the materials), you will take away a lot from this class. That said, if your other classes are already killing you, I will caution you against taking Arabic. It is, after all, A HELL LOT OF WORK.","Arabic is an incredible language and is worth learning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand you really feel like you've learned a ton by the end of the course.  However, it's also very difficult and time-consuming.","it's great, but prepared for many hours of work","Arabic A is awesome, and Arabic is a beautiful and useful language to know!","By the end of the course you will be able to read and write in Arabic.","I marked this course as difficult. I spent more time on it than any other. You will have homework every day. That being said, I would recommend it to anyone. Best decision I've made at Harvard = taking Arabic. It was challenging but SO worth it. When you rock that last test (al hamdu lillah!) and think back at how far you've come, you will be very happy and very proud. But keep working hard, and know if you can't commit the time necessary to do this. Also, try to practice your speaking skills. Mine fell behind and I became timid and talked even less. I had to really work to catch up for the oral exam. Please please please make a study group!!","It's very time and energy consuming but you know the language very well after one year of learning it everyday.","This is an exceptional course that will give you an extremely impressive familiarity with Modern Standard Arabic after only one year. It receives my highest recommendation!","You must be willing to work hard and enjoy learning new languages.","A great introduction to the Arab world through its lingua franca. Be prepared to make mistakes and be patient-it is completely alien to someone who has only had exposure to Romance languages but the sooner you learn to absorb the language on its own terms the more you will enjoy it. That being said, it is definitely one of the best kept treasures at Harvard.","Arabic A is a great class with very devoted instructors. Meeting every day means you really get to know the material, but it also means you spend 5 hours in class a week and maybe another 5-10+ outside on homework. It's not an easy class, but very rewarding!","That it is difficult and one must remember that the course in the end is only so useful as the dialect we learn is not one that people really use in the Arabic world except in higher educated circles which is very small.","Learning Arabic is an incredibly interesting experience, albeit also very very difficult. Advice-- constantly review vocab, it's a difficult thing to learn at the last minute.","I would say that it provides full immersion in the language but that the homework assignments can be overwhelming. The course on the whole may require more time and commitment than a student who is otherwise enrolled full-time in graduate studies can offer. But I would also point out that the instructor and TF are very dedicated!","Keep a diary of grammar rules, go to office hours for extra practice and don't be shy of getting appointments for in-person meetings. Learn the al-masdars for vocabulary too!","Feryal and Nicola are wonderful teachers, and this class provides a very solid foundation in Arabic. It's not an easy class, but the work required is quite reasonable (just make sure to make flashcards of all the vocab in each unit and memorize them IN ADVANCE of each unit-- do this and I promise you'll be fine!). The class is well-paced and well-taught; I recommend it enthusiastically and without reservations.","Dalia is an amazing instructor! She really goes above and beyond to make sure students understand the material and does so in a manner that will really stick. Arabic require a lot of individual time and effort and you need to be willing to commit multiple hours a day to learning the language. In the end it is really worth it though.","You learn so much Arabic in this course. By the end of the year, even students who began with no experience were able to communicate effectively in Arabic. The preceptor taught us almost exclusively in Arabic and was understood by all of the students. TAKE THIS CLASS!","It's really hard. Don't take it unless you are ready to give a significant amount of your time to this class. If you are, the hard work is rewarding and you come out having learned a lot.","You need to go to office hours to learn to speak. DO THIS.","You really will learn a lot very quickly. If there is any interest in learning Arabic for whatever reason, I would highly recommend taking this course.","If you have any interest in Arabic and the Middle East, take this class.  Arabic is a beautiful language and you get so much exposure to Arabic culture and history through the class.  This is a difficult course that will require attention, but at the same time there is a great support network among your classmates, TFs, and professors that make the work bearable.  If you do take this course, absolutely utilize office hours, and try to get as much speaking practice (through Arabic tables and random review sessions with classmates) as possible.","This course is an excellent way to really learn Arabic.  However it is a very difficult language and very time consuming.  Every friday is either a test or a quiz and there is nightly homework that requires effort.  That being said, the preceptors understand that it is a very difficult course so they take that into account and are very helpful and considerate in their grading.","It's important to be proactive, and devote a lot of time to everything!","A great introduction into the Arabic language, and as I have come to know it one of the best taught languages at Harvard. After one year I must say that I have earned a decent vocabulary and skills and knowledge over broad fields of grammar, writing, listening, reading etc. The course is definitely a lot of work in the beginning and pretty much throughout the whole year. But especially with the class being taught every day, a constant commitment to it results in rewarding knowledge.","This class is enormously difficult, but so rewarding. You really do learn. Work hard, stay on top of the homework, go to office hours, make flash cards, and whatever you do, don't lose faith. If you are interested in the Middle East, take this class, even if you're a junior -- but the earlier the better, don't hesitate like I did.","This class is an awesome way to get started with Arabic, even if you don't know a single word when you walk in on day one, but you really need to put in the hours every day or you will never learn a thing.","A lot of work, but moves quickly to get to a good amount of the the basic aspects of the language.","This is a fantastic class! Be ready to work harder than you though possible, but the personal satisfaction at the end of the year is terrific."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I would recommend this course only if a student has the time to spare many many hours of working and also make sure he\/she knows that unlike many other languages, Arabic requires a long-termed period of study (a few years- at-least two-three) to make use of the language.","Although I was initially a little intimidated about starting Arabic, I ended up loving this class. I would definitely recommend Arabic A, but be prepared to put in enough time to keep up with the material.","Take Arabic! It's a great language taught by competent and interesting people and it opens up a new world for us to understand.","Well its the only Arabic class available but a good one at that.","Take it if you are actually really interested in learning Arabic, its not an easy fifth class kind.","It's hard..I'm not yet sure if it's worth it","It is very difficult if you are bad at spelling or don't like memorizing words","This class is very helpful in starting you off with the basics of Arabic. If you really want to learn the language, take it, and try to do as much Arabic outside of the classroom as well. Do not take this class if you just want to pass your language requirement; Arabic is classified as a Category 5 language (one of the most difficult languages to learn as an English-speaker), and you'd be better off with something like Spanish or French if you want an easy language pass.","I would absolutely recommend that anyone and everyone even slightly interested in Arabic shop or take this course. I shopped it on a whim and loved it from the first minute! I have never been super enthusiastic about foreign languages, and in fact was quite intimidated with the idea of taking a college level language course, but this class is simultaneously fascinating and manageable.

Dalia is a great teacher; definitely try and take it from her if at all possible!","If you have other things to focus on or don't want a very challenging course load, Arabic A is a mistake. But, if you certain you want to learn the language, it is a great idea.","It's really amazing. You make so much progress so fast, and it is really rewarding. But you need to put in a lot of effort in order to get as much out of it as you should. Study vocabulary!","When you look for a language class to take here, you have to consider two things: which language you want to take and how much you will enjoy the instruction of that language at Harvard.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Arabic language is concerned, I characterize it as the Stilton cheese of foreign languages for an English speaker.  I am sorry if that sounds pretentious, but I think it's a good analogy.  If you enjoy learning languages, their new alphabets, vocabulary, and grammar, I think you will love Arabic.  If you're not a big language person to begin with, I suspect you'll hate Arabic.  There are lots of complicated grammatical rules and of course, there are few cognates.  So I think it takes a fair amount of dedication to take this language.  In that light, I would not recommend taking this language class if you are not a language person but want to take an exotic language just to fulfill the language requirement.  There are much easier languages you could take for the requirement that are just as exotic.  Similarly, I don't think you should just take this language on a whim.  As I said, it takes a ton of effort, and if you are not really committed to it, I think it will probably become frustrating.\r\n\r\nAs far as how this class is taught, I really have no complaints.  My teacher, Feryal Hijazi, is by far the best teacher I have had at Harvard.  She is extremely enthusiastic about the language and her students.  She will take an extra at office hours every time she has them if her students need her, and she would do that at the drop of a hat.  She is dedicated, first and foremost, to making sure you get the most out of the class.  I find that the class prepares you well to speak, read, and write quite a bit in a short period of time.  In my experience, though, that means the class covers the materials very quickly, and, of course, you have to go five days a week, and I think you should take advantage of all the office hours that are offered to maximize your learning.  \r\n\r\nSo, if you are not turned off by the difficulties of the language and are completely willing to spend a good deal of time on it, I think you will have a wonderful experience in Arabic A because of both the teachers and the language itself.  I wholeheartedly recommend this class.","a great way to learn a new language, quick results","Great course overall, but you are assigned homework daily. Make sure you stay on top of the material, although falling behind is not fatal since this is an introductory course, it may mean a bad quiz or exam grade or two.","Arabic is my favorite class so far at Harvard! It's intimidating at first, but you really get the hang of it when you have to go to class and do the homework for it every day. Definitely shop different preceptors and find whose teaching style works best with your learning style!","Learning Arabic, like any other language, will require some time to absorb the vocabulary and work through the grammar. The class itself is very enjoyable and fairly relaxed despite the fast pace.","This class is fast-paced, but enjoyable for those interested in Arab culture. I would highly recommend it.","This is a great class! Definitely take it. I took it for fun and though the grammar component can get annoying, we do a lot of speaking as well as singing!","The staff have a true desire to work with a student to ensure mastery of Arabic.","This is an excellent introduction to Arabic, great instruction and good prep materials (in comparison to Al Kitaab, used by other universities).","You get out of it what you put into it.","I didn't have a great experience with foreign language in high school. When I fulfilled my language requirement, I thought I'd never take another language class in my life. I am so glad to be wrong. Arabic, while definitely a rigorous challenge, has been the highlight of my academic experience here so far.","Get Lispeth- she's the best TF ever.  If you learn the vocab for the week over the weekend, and if you do your homework and review the material every night, you'll do more than fine.","It is definitely challenging and you must put in the time and effort.  If you do though, it will not be too difficult and it will be very rewarding.","The course is incredibly hard. If you're willing to put in an insane amount of work, it pays off though.","This course will teach you the structure of the language very well. You may not be able to speak it extensively, but that is not a realistic goal for the first semester. By the end of the first semester, you will be able to understand sentence structure very well.","Arabic is an interesting language, and, from my experience, well taught here. If you take the trouble (it isn't too much time) to memorise the grammar rules and vocabulary at the beginning of the week, the course tends to be fairly easy. The tests especially were never too hard. Feryal and Ali were both great instructors who complemented each other well. They're both extremely friendly and helpful. The one difficulty with Feryal was that, while her pronunciation was impeccable and she explained new content and rules effectively, she often struggled to understand our questions (maybe due to a slight difficulty with English). I therefore often saved my questions for Ali's lessons, as he was much better at clarifying doubts.","You will learn a lot but be prepared to look around to multiple TFs for help with understanding a concept of the language because explanations are not always complete. Expect to try and put together disparate pieces from many handouts and info which doesn't always seem linear or comprehensive. Make sure you have time to do an hour of work every night at least. In order to do well on the tests, you need to go an extra mile with vocab and grammar concepts because not everything will have been covered.","This class is challenging and demanding but worthwhile.","Arabic is not in any sense of the word, an easy language to learn. So fair warning, you have to work hard to really learn it, and unless you're really interested in learning Arabic, it isn't a good way to get the language requirement out of the way. That being said, it is taught relatively well at Harvard, although the syllabus, course speed and vocab lists, in addition to the language itself can be frustrating at times.","You should have a vested interest in committing to Arabic for the long term.  This class has been the most rewarding and interesting of the semester, and should you have any interest in Arabic or the Middle East I think that it is the perfect class for you.  Elementary Arabic on its own, though, is almost useless in that you are provided with a firm foundation to work off of rather than a truly functional repertoire of language skills and vocabulary.","arabic is an extremely difficult language to learn and the tfs\/professors don't attempt to make it easier for anybody. take this class at your own risk.","While learning Arabic is not only suitable for the times we live in but also cool, be prepared for a difficult class. It is by NO means easy, and you absolutely cannot afford to slack off even a little.","To stick with the tough times throughout the course and consistently complete the homework and it will be a particularly valuable experience.","This course is difficult, but Professor Wulfsberg is a dedicated teacher and the materials are well-designed. Your Arabic language skills will improve considerably by the end of the semester.","This class is awesome.","Dahlia is a phenomenal teacher. She is incredibly kind and supportive, and does a fantastic job of really ingraining the language into her students. Lispeth, the TF this fall, was hilarious and remarkably helpful. Her classes and Dahlia's were all great. If given the chance, do your best to section with Dahlia.","It's a great class, but is work intensive.","Arabic is a beautiful language, and this course goes above and beyond in exposing you to contemporary culture and the use of the language. You'll be glad you took it, as it was definitely my favorite class this semester!","It's a lot of work, but a lot of fun! I feel like I've learned more Arabic in one semester than I did in a year or two of French in high school.","Definitely spend the time outside of class to learn the vocabulary each week - will help immensely during class periods\/when it comes time to prepare for the exams!","I would say that this class is definitely an asset, but unless you have time to commit to really getting to know the material it will be difficult.","The course is interesting and thorough but difficult because of the number of hours for work and studying, as well as the fast pace of the course.","TAKE THIS!!!! Dalia is the sweetest teacher I have ever had. She cares deeply about each and every one of us, and is unbelievably patient (even when it's clear that some students hadn't reviewed the vocab, or didn't do an assignment that wasn't collected). Her enthusiasm makes getting up for a 9AM class five days a week SO worth it. She comes up with great mnemonic devices for helping us remember connections between words, and introduces topics in clever ways! She is also always willing to stay as long as you need at office hours. \r\n\r\nDon't be intimidated one bit by the difficulty of the language. The resources are superb. This is by far my favorite class! I had no prior experience with the language before and I am so glad I decided to take this!","Learning another language in high school and understanding how to study language vocabulary and grammar on your own before coming into the class are invaluable.  Having some knowledge of the character system\/Middle Eastern life would be really helpful, but the playing field gets leveled out once the course gets into vocabulary and more advanced grammar.  In all, it takes a lot of work but the pay off is enormous and Dalia and Lispeth could NOT be more enthusiastic or helpful.  It's also fantastic learning about the culture of the Middle East.   Beware of the early class if you are not a morning person because the class tends to start right at 9 am, but I found that it helped me to get my day started.","I think you have to be committed in order to take this class. It is a course that is both very time consuming and very rewarding but you have to put in the effort. The course is demanding and the professors move very quickly and thus it is up to you to get yourself on the level that they are expecting.","I would definitely take this class with Dalia. She is sweet and adorable and its fun to learn arabic from her. Lispeth is also the best TF especially when it came to preparing for tests.","I loved\/love this class, truly. The verb tense confusion comes from the fact that I still have a second semester to complete, but having just walked out of the final this morning (yay) -- regardless of what I earned on the final or even as a grade this semester, I really have enjoyed being in this class so far. I would recommend (and have recommended) this class to several of my peers -- its quite enjoyable. The only codicil to my enthusiasm is that potential Arabic A students should be made aware of the fact that homework does not stop during reading period. We still learned new concepts and had to turn in new assignments while trying to study Units 1-8 for the final. It all worked out in the end, but it's important to let people know.","Arabic takes some work to learn, and the pace is pretty quick, but if you really focus on learning the vocabulary (make flashcards, etc) and memorizing the grammar principles you'll be fine. Never skip class - there's something new every day. Dalia is the best instructor, and Lispeth is a fantastic TF.","Start making flashcards in Arabic as soon as you learn the script.  It's way harder to transition to reading easily when you use transliteration too long.","You definitely have to put in a fair amount of work each night but it is definitely worth it.","Though difficult, Arabic is an extremely rewarding and interesting language - well worth the time you put in!","This course requires a lot of work and effort and if you just want to take a language to fill the language requirement then arabic is not for you. However, if you are very dedicated and passionate about learning arabic then definitely take this class because it is awesome!","It's hard. Really hard. But it's rewarding, and even if your grade doesn't reflect how well you know the language, it's worth it.","Love Arabic so much! It's been so so so much fun and such useful language to know. BUT it's incredibly time consuming so if you want to do well and have no prior knowledge of Arabic be sure you have the time to put into the class in order to do well.","TONS of information thrown at you. Gather as much as you can but a lot WILL slip by."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The class is amazing, and has amazing professors who really want you to learn and help you, but also incredibly challenging and requires a lot of work. Also very time consuming.","This is generally a pretty good course, and I feel like I learnt a lot from it. The workload isn't too heavy, and involves lots of small assignments (which can get a bit tedious) and quizzes rather than too much in one go. The in-class experience can get a bit dull sometimes (which is why I really wish Arabic had an intensive track) especially in the spring semester (though not in section), but the homework assignments help reinforce concepts quite well. Both Ustaadha Feryal and Ali are lovely, exceptionally helpful if you're stuck on anything, and complement each other well - Feryal, being a native speaker, has a good 'sense' of the language and culture, while Ali, having learnt it later, understands specific difficulties that beginners have.","I would recommend it because I believe Arabic is taught very good at Harvard. However, I believe that it would definitely be better and more productive for the students if more time is given on some subjects, more time is given for the practice of talking the language and less homework in the exam periods.","It is incredibly difficult, but you learn so much that it is worth it in the long run.","prepare yourself for a lot of work and a lot of catching up \r\nalso prepare for unevenly difficult or easy assessments depending on who makes them","I learned so much in Arabic A. It could be hard but was definitely worth it.","If you decide you want to learn Arabic, this course will take you very far in achieving that goal. If you want to be happy while doing it, Ustaadha Feryal is a great choice in professors. She truly cares about the success of her students and wants to help you learn the language. She makes you smile and laugh during class and I highly recommend her as a professor because her infectious enthusiasm for the language will make you love arabic even while it eats your social life and sleep opportunities.","This class is just as hard as everyone says. Learn the alphabet before you start, and you'll be in good shape. The teachers and small classes make it all worthwhile and mostly enjoyable.","The teaching staff of Arabic A are all amazing! Although Arabic is a difficult language to learn and homework averages around 3 hours\/day, but it is so worthwhile!","Arabic is a very, very difficult language to learn, so don't take it on a whim. But if you legitimately want to learn Arabic and use it in the future, this course is worth the time and effort, even if it is periodically frustrating.","Take Arabic!! You may never get such an opportunity again. It is a challenging language, sure, but you will be prepared for it as there is class every day and you will get lots of practice; it's a lot of work but I actually considered this my easiest class because they prepare you so well. Just show up to class every day and you will learn! A beautiful language and so fun to learn. If you are a little bit scared or intimidated by this language, try to get into Luke's class!! He is incredibly kind and understanding, coming from an English learner's background, he won't let you look stupid, and he will make sure you succeed in the class. This is my favorite class and it is largely due to having such an amazing teacher! Also, you will get really close with your classmates because the sections are small and you meet every day.","Arabic may not be the best language if you are just casually looking for a new language to learn. Learning a new alphabet is fun and not nearly as hard as it seems, but once you start grammar, Arabic gets extremely complicated.","There are lots of people who take this with some (or a lot) of background in Arabic (or similar languages like Farsi or Urdu). Don't get discouraged by the fact that they're way better than you are. It's doable for someone with no prior experience, and it couldn't be better taught. Dalia is an outstanding section leader and the class itself is a ton of fun. You'll never learn this much this fast anywhere else.","You cannot take this course without a genuine interest in the language as well as a lot of time on your hands. It is effectively another P-set class.","Dalia is a great teacher, and this class is perfect if you want to take Arabic. No background is needed at all-great intro course.","Arabic is a hard language to learn, especially if you start from nothing. But you will learn a lot in this course and it is well taught. You will be surprised how much you know in a year, IF you put in the effort!","If you are reading this because you are choosing between Arabic and another language, TAKE ARABIC!!! Dalia is the sweetest person ever and is so invested in your learning the language. The professors spend a great deal of time preparing materials for the course, and providing feedback on what you submit. The pacing of the course is ideal -- you learn enough so that you feel you can eventually be fluent, but it is not so fast that you feel you can't keep up. You might worry that the class will be filled with a lot of \"heritage speakers.\" There are a number of them, yes. But I had zero Arabic experience before taking the class - I didn't even know the alphabet - and that never hindered me. The teaching staff starts from the very beginning; you learn two or three letters a day until you have the alphabet down. I can honestly say that the best academic decision I made my freshman year was to take Arabic. Do it.","its a great way to fulfill the language requirement and its a great way to learn a new language. I already feel like i am beginning to progress, which makes me excited for my future in arabic. Luke was a great professor and was able to get me excited about this course.","This is a big time commitment but it's worth it.","Great class,satisfied with how much I have learned, but also something you have to be committed to.","This course is hard. Don't take it unless you're looking to do several hours of work a day, let alone a week, but if you're committed to the language, it will pay off.","It's really really really hard, if you think you might not want to spend a ton of time learning a very hard language avoid this class. It is not for those who cannot push themselves (like me)","Arabic is an amazing experience and quite well taught and well organized class at Harvard! That said, it is also very very time consuming if you want to do well. Like most classes at Harvard, you get what you put into it. If you want to really learn the language and feel comfortable with it within the year, you will definitely need to make sure you have the time to devote to memorizing new vocab each week and studying for the weekly quizzes. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is eager to learn and willing to put in the time!","Be aware that the playing field may not be level in the beginning as many students are heritage speakers or have previous alphabet knowledge, but it is leveled out somewhat by the second semester.","It is challenging, and time-consuming, but it will pay off if you want a solid foundation in Arabic.","Very concrete, thorough first-year understanding of the course! Highly recommend! I loved this class. The professor, Luke Leafgran and TF Molly are extremely patient and understanding. They really want you to learn the language and aren't too strict\/over-bearing with assignments\/homework. Definitely be ready to put in time everyday for this course, but everyone I know feels very satisfied with their Arabic proficiency at this point! Definitely worth it!","If you're debating about taking this class, do it. But make sure you talk to past students for advice on which professor to take it with.","This was such an amazing class but I would only recommend it to people who are really passionate about learning arabic and are willing to put in a lot of time and effort to do so. I wouldn't take this class just to fulfill a language requirement, only take it if you plan on continuing to learn arabic.","If you want to learn Arabic, take this class! The only possible downsides are that Arabic is grammar-heavy (but I, personally, think the structure is very helpful in learning it) and that you will have a small assignment every day. That said, the course is very fun and taught by excellent professors and TFs. Make sure to shop several sections to find a professor that you like.","This is a great class and Arabic is a great language. Do the work regularly and you'll enjoy this class a lot!","It is great to do if you want to learn Arabic, but you should be ready to cut back on all of your other classes or extracurricular activities as a result.","Put the work in every day, make a routine, and you will be okay. Don't half ass. Take part in class and take notes every day.","This class is incredibly challenging but very worth it around April","I really had to work in this class, but it was well worth it.  We had daily homework, a quiz or a test around once a week, and my friend in the class counted that, this year, we had learned around 560 vocabulary words and over 110 verbs, not to mention a huge number of grammar points.  Further, we worked at a breakneck speed that could be a little overwhelming at times; I had to make sure to give a significant amount of time and care each day to learn every new point the teachers asked of me.  When I didn't, it was easy to get (temporarily) left behind.  That said, I learned probably as much Arabic this year as I did in three years of taking Spanish in high school.  My instructor, Feryal Hijazi, was also fantastic and is extremely dedicated to her students.  For instance, one time, we were supposed to take a test on a Friday, a day our TF normally teaches class.  Our TF had to go to Mumbai, so another TF was supposed to come in and administer the test to us.  I was in the classroom a few minutes early, and I saw my instructor run in.  When I asked her why she was in class, she told me she decided that she \"didn't want us to take the test with a stranger.\"  She came all the way from Quincy (the town of Quincy), which is over an hour away by train, just to make us feel a little more comfortable on our test.  So if you are willing to put in the effort for this course, I think you will not only learn a lot, but also, especially with Feryal Hijazi, get an instructor who will support your learning in every way possible.","I loved this class. If you're considering starting a foreign language at Harvard, SHOP ARABIC! Luke is a great professor, the materials are very helpful, and the order of topics is logical. While this class is intensive, there are several excellent ways to get help. The professors are very approachable.","The class requires a lot of hours of studying per night and per week.  Unfortunately I didn't really have the amount of time required to adequately pick up all of the vocabulary.  As a result, I struggled throughout the year.  However, the class is a great one, and if you have the time to devote to it, it can be a really enjoyable and valuable experience.","Amazing class. Whether you are looking to understand the Quran better through this course (as in know the meaning of more words) or wanting to understand Arabic and speak it with your friends, this class will be very helpful. But in the end, it all depends on how much effort you put into it. This semester, I was able to hold a conversation over lunch in Arabic with a friend. Of course, I did not say a LOT, but given that I knew how to speak no Arabic last fall, it feels like a great accomplishment. And so does writing 3 pages in Arabic at the end of your exam.","This class is a very smooth transition to learning about the Arab world and of course, for studying the language. You learn so much!","It is hard, but it is extremely rewarding. By the end of the first semester, I felt like i had already learned enough to be conversational about some topics. You come out of the class confident and amazed at how much you've learned.","It's an awesome introduction to Arabic and worth the time you have to put in.","Arabic A is difficult, but an altogether amazing experience!  You get a thorough introduction to a relatively hard language in a very welcoming environment.  I would say, though, that you should be committed to studying Arabic past the A level before starting because you do not gain enough ability after just this course."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would tell them to definitely take Arabic. I believe you connect better with someone when you know their language. It helps you understand their culture and where they come from.","You have to be prepared to work hard every day since you have assignments due every day. However, that is probably the point since it's the best way to learn a language like Arabic.","This course is surprisingly challenging and very time consuming. Only take this course if you have a sincere commitment to learn Arabic! If you do, then the challenge will be meaningful and you will be surprised at how much you learn. \r\n\r\nAs someone who had no experience with the language, I found it extremely difficult to succeed in this course. It is very fast paced, and you are expected to complete homework regarding lessons that you will learn the next day. Without previous Arabic experience, this felt very difficult and sometimes impossible. My instructor, though, was very understanding and was committed to pushing me forward. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this course only if you have a great desire to learn the language, and if you are prepared for a challenge that will demand a great amount of time - more so than any other course I took this semester.","If you want to learn how to speak Arabic in a practical context, this class will not teach you that so much because modern standard Arabic (which is taught here) is almost entirely different from colloquial Arabic.","This class is nice but lacks structure and I personally saw a lot of people that had no Arabic background struggling with the class.","Time commitment","its a lot of work - probably the hardest class i took this semester but it pays a lot of dividends\r\nin the long run.","This class will help you learn Arabic faster than any anywhere else: Harvard goes through in a semester what most universities cover in a year. Of course, this means you should be able to dedicate a lot of time to the class (i.e. don't take it just to fulfill your language requirement). If you get behind on vocab or grammar, it is very difficult to catch up. That said, it's an incredibly rewarding class, and we all love Sami!","Take this class if you're interested in languages, but know that it will be extremely hard at times content and work wise.","Arabic is a fascinating language, but the formal version we learn (MSA) focuses a lot on details. There are a few weeks in this class spent on case endings, which I felt to be a waste of time. The course moved very quickly, and we spent very little time practicing our oral Arabic. As a result, I feel like I don't remember all the vocabulary we learned, and I still can't realllly hold a full conversation in Arabic.","The quality of this class will largely depend on the quality of your teacher. You will have the opportunity to get a feel for the different teachers during shopping period. Find a teacher that fits what you want to get out of the class. And get ready to work hard. Class is so much better when you come having done the homework and readings.","Dalia and Lispeth are great teachers and help you learn the material very well. However, I've heard that some other sections aren't nearly so well taught. As for my section, I feel like I enjoyed myself and learned a lot. If you study the words a little bit each day and memorize them as you go, it works much better than memorizing them last second!","It's an awesome class and is definitely one of the more enjoyable courses I've taken in the semester.","This class requires quite of bit of work and stamina, particularly at the beginning, but the teaching is very effective and everyone wants you to do well, so if you put in the work, you will see results.","It's hard and don't do it if you aren't willing to commit to something you're going to be studying for a long time. But it's one of the most humbling and rewarding challenges I've ever done, and the language has an uncanny ability to make you fall in love with it. Both the professor and TF are out of this world, and it's a great way to build a personal relationship with your teachers when that is often sadly lacking in your first semester at Harvard.","Don't take this if you're only looking to fulfill the Foreign Language Requirement. If you're truly interested in learning Arabic, however, the work will be well-worth the time and effort. Plus, Luke and Lispeth are great!","To be prepared for very hard work.","It's a lot of work, but the pay off is so great. Such a rewarding experience, especially for students who have never studied Arabic before.","dalia and lispeth are a dream team! this class is wonderful. anyone with even the slightest interest in arabic should definitely take the course","Be ready for work, learn the alphabet beforehand","This course requires no prerequisites, but I would advise becoming familiar with the Arabic alphabet beforehand\/during shopping period; it will save you much duress the first few weeks of the course. I have heard the teaching styles\/ focuses vary wildly among the instructors, so shop more than one time slot and instructor. This is an intense language course but also very rewarding, especially for those with no background in the language. In all, expect to work hard but to learn a great deal. I'm very glad I took this class.","Some say introductory language classes are easy. Arabic A is an exception to this. Take this class if you are willing to put in the work to truly learn the language. Don't take this class if all you want to do is satisfy a language requirement.","Arabic is an easy language to learn if you understand that it won't come all at once; if you focus on internalizing each concept one at a time, it comes easily and naturally","it is very hard! Like a lot of work!","Arabic is a difficult language to learn but if you have the passion to do it, you will be successful.","Be prepared to work!","If you have never taken Arabic before, this class will be a lot of work. However, you will learn an enormous amount. Be prepared to teach yourself certain things at times, as it can be unclear exactly what you need to know. Start learning the vocabulary from the very beginning, as you will be tested on it throughout the term. Also be prepared to have other students in the class that have taken Arabic, and although this can be frustrating at times, this class is designed for a total beginner.","The class is very time-consuming and intensive. It is often difficult to keep up with the pace, but it is worth it. The teaching staff is excellent.","Professor Mahmoud is great person -- funny, knowledgeable, genuinely interested in teaching. The course itself was pretty disorganized though, and the homework and lectures didn't always seem connected. We focused a lot on writing and grammar, which was helpful to a point, but I would have liked more practice speaking and listening. You will still learn a lot though, and Prof. Mahmoud has some awesome grammar analogies to look forward to.","Try to get into Dalia and Lispeth's sections! They are a great team. This is a really fun class if you like learning languages.","Arabic is incredibly difficult but it is a beautiful, beautiful language and Dalia is beyond compare. Prepare yourself for a lot of work, but its worth it if you're really interested.","Make sure you dedicate yourself. Dedication and constant work are the only ways to improve in the class.","I'd warn them that it's a very work-intensive class, and that memorization and practice are the main components of the work.","very time consuming but such a beautiful language to learn!","Do not take this course lightly. Arabic is a difficult (but extremely enjoyable) language to learn. As long as you put in adequate hard work, you'll be fine!","Arabic is an amazing language, and this class really helps teach you both the language and how to learn a language. I had never taken a spoken language before, but it was not an issue. The professors are all great and the setup of the class is very conducive to learning a difficult language.","Make sure to get Professor Abo-Haggar.","You will definitely learn conversational skills in this class, and you can read just about anything after taking this class, even if you don't have the vocabulary to understand it all.","This is an amazing class if you are genuinely interested in Arabic, or just learning about different cultures and languages in general. However, it is not for everyone. Before enrolling in the course, one should know that it is very grammar-intensive and a very long-term commitment if you want to speak well. Dalia and Lispeth are both wonderful people, and amazing at what they do!","Be prepared to teach yourself a majority of the material and put in a lot of time and dedication for learning the new language.","If you have any desire to learn Arabic, this class will do the job. Provided you put in the effort and follow instructions, you will learn the language.","It's tough but fun. Really well administered.","The class is great, but it requires a lot of work to learn well in this class.","If you're looking to get the language requirement done and over with, this probably isn't the best option for you. But if you sincerely want to learn a language in a great educational environment with teachers who really want you to learn and succeed, Arabic is terrific.","It is a very challenging language and the class moves at a fast pace, so you really have to be dedicated to learning Arabic if you take it.  But if you are dedicated, then it is great.  Sami is a very helpful and entertaining professor."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You'll learn a ton of Arabic and it's a relatively easy class, but often super disorganized. Prof. Hisham knows a ton about grammar and teaches things beyond the textbook which can be nice, but it makes it harder to do well on the tests, which are the same for all the professors. There is less of an emphasis on speaking, but section somewhat makes up for this. Lidia is great, she doesn't mess around and has a really dry sense of humor.","You need to shop not only according to your time schedule, but also according to the lecturer. This really matters a lot because they all have to teach the same way but do so in very, very different ways.","It is hard. It takes work. but the payoff is unbelievable. I learned under both Dalia and Luke, who were both fantastic teachers. Lispeth is a gem as far as TFs go. She works above and beyond to make sure her students are as well prepared as possible and her knowledge of the Arabic language, its history, the origins of words, etc is mindblowing. She is literally the secret weapon of the Arabic department.","It is incredibly difficult, demanding, and fast-paced. It is frequently confusing and hard to follow. It is easy to fall behind. However, if you are willing to put in the required work (and then a lot of extra time to practice) then I think you could succeed.","I'd tell anyone, make sure you get Sami's section.

Take the time to shop around and find the teacher that best meets your Arabic needs. I was really happy to be in a section where we spoke mostly Arabic and were constantly pushed out of our comfort zones. Also, the fewer people in section, the better. This class was a great introduction to Arabic, and I look forward to taking second year Arabic next year.","Dalia and Lispeth are wonderful teachers who really want to help their students learn Arabic as well as possible. You can tell how much they care. The class requires a fair amount of study. Expect homework every day. However, if you keep up each day with the vocabulary and new concepts, it is an engaging and challenging course. You get out of it what you put into it.","It is a very difficult languages to learn but it is fun and exciting.","Be prepared to work hard, but also learn a lot. You will get out of the course proportional to what you put in.","Think carefully before you decide to do Arabic. It is a very rewarding class, but is a huge time commitment.","Taking this class is an opportunity you won't always get! It's so unique, cool, and rewarding-so if you're thinking about it, go for it! It's totally worth it.","Second semester seems more manageable that first semester because you are over the incredibly steep learning curve, but there is a lot of grammar and a lot of vocabulary to stay on top of. That said, Dalia, Alex, and Lispeth are really the Arabic language dream team and compliment each other well. This class makes for a great community of study groups and friends, especially among the freshmen.","This course is extremely difficult and time-consuming. You will get a ton out of it, but you can begin to resent language-learning because there is so much work. Get Lispeth as your tf.","Be prepared to self-teach yourself.","Great class!","Arabic A does a good job of taking a difficult foreign language and distilling it to a manageable level. You will be expected to work a great deal in this class, but the payoff is very satisfying. This class' biggest plus is its teachers: the professors and TFs, in my experience, are absolutely wonderful and really want the best for their students. They really go above and beyond. I made the mistake of waiting until midway through second semester to really start going to office hours. \r\n\r\nOne more word of advice: This class (and the teachers, to a degree) straddle the line between a more grammar-based approach and a speaking-based approach. I was lucky enough to have a teacher who tried to emphasize both, but even then I waited longer than I should have to develop my speaking skills. Try to build confidence in speaking as early as possible, and resist the urge to coast on your abstract knowledge of the grammar. The oral exam at the end of the year will creep up on you fast!","This is a difficult class, be willing to put in a lot of work and learn a lot. Your experience in this class depends hugely upon what professor's section you are in; I would recommend shopping around and seeing which style you like the best. Some put a lot more emphasis on speaking and listening than others. Dalia was wonderful, and her office hours were extremely helpful for clarification and learning. You should attend those more than I did, especially if you are struggling.","you gotta work for an A","To keep in mind this is a hard and intensive course.","Look, if you really want to learn the Arabic language, you WILL learn a lot in this class. However, there is graded homework every night and an assessment (test or quiz) every Friday. I found it particularly frustrating at times and rewarding at others. Also, remember that it is a YEAR LONG commitment. I learned that the hard way...","I wouldn't recommend taking this course off-hand, or as a way to simply fulfil a foreign language requirement, but if you are interested in learning Arabic and are willing to put in the time, the course does a really good job of teaching the language.","Arabic should not be taught the way it is taught in Arabic A at Harvard.","Definitely do not take this course unless you are very interested in learning Arabic as it is a real commitment, but the teachers are excellent and you learn a lot. In short, if you are interested, definitely take it, but do not underestimate it."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["That it's getting harder and they should consider carefully whether they want to commit for a full year of homework everyday and mostly - waking up to class in the early morning eveyday","This is an amazing class and Sami is a really great teacher. Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning Arabic and are prepared to put in the work.","Arabic is very cool, a challenge, but truly a language I appreciate.","It adds up. You need to stay on top of it otherwise you fall behind.","It's tough, and if you're going to take it you need to be really enthusiastic about the language. The first few weeks are killer, but don't give up - once you get the hang of the language, it comes easier, even if you still have to work for it. The class builds a really great sense of community, too.","Arabic is a really fun language. Please don't just take it because you want to go into business or study the Arab Spring. There is so much depth and nuance. One of the most beautiful languages out there!","This Arabic class is very fast paced and will teach you the language much faster than any program out there.  After only half a semester, I find my self able to be able to draw basic understanding from Arabic conversations and classical texts.  If you have an interest in understanding and or speaking Arabic, take this class.  The TF and professor are absolutely ballin'.  There is about an hour of homework every day but once you get into the rhythm of it, it's not that bad.","Do not come in without a passion to learn Arabic. You must be invested and be willing to put a lot of time in for this class. Also it is a full year course so be careful when choosing because you will be locked in.","Be ready to work, but also to have a lot of fun. Fears about the language are often overblown, and with Dalia and Lispeth you will get all the help you need. I definitely was fortunate enough to have two of the best teachers in the department. If you want to stand out to employers, participate in the global economy, and\/or want to learn a really exciting language, take Arabic.","This is a very difficult class, but if you can do it you'll be so glad you did.","This is an amazing, and very difficult class. Lispeth is an *amazing* TF and if you get her, know that she will go the extra mile to make sure that you understand the material and do well. Dalia is such a sweet person, and a great person to learn arabic from.","The class was a lot of fun and very rewarding.","The course requires a lot of time and energy, but the rigorous pace of the course means that you will learn more than you thought possible in a short period of time. The instructor is also terrific and knows how to teach for beginners.","Be prepared for a very intensive course. Know that you will not be prepared to speak so much as you will be strongly prepared to read and write in formal settings.","This class is difficult, and you will have to devote a significant amount of time to in in order to do well. As is true with any course, really think about how it will fit in to your schedule.","This course is demanding in difficult. I would only take it if you are genuinely interested in learning the language and are ready to make the commitment.","College is the best time to learn another language well","If you want to learn Arabic, this is an excellent class because you will learn a lot! Don't be too scared off by the workload if you think that Arabic is something you're interested in, but at the same time definitely expect there to be a large workload going into the class. You will need to practice a lot on your own to really learn the material (you will be spending a minimum of 2-3 hours every day studying plus another hour of class time 5 days a week).  Additionally, know that there is a significant learning curve at the beginning of the class so be prepared to put in extra effort the first month or so as you learn the alphabet. All that being said, this class is very rewarding when you see how much you've learned at the end of the semester.","It's definitely difficult. Arabic isn't easy to learn. However, the instructors work with you personally and make sure you are actually learning. Yeah, it's difficult, but it's so rewarding. At the beginning of the year I couldn't even pronounce a letter and now, after a few months, I can actually have conversations and understand the language!","Great class but quite intense","It's a very challenging, but very rewarding language class. Be prepared to put in a significant amount of work. The teaching staff is excellent. You'll learn a lot in a short amount of time.","Depends on dat tf doe","This is a great course which quickly teaches the ropes of the language and sets you up for further study. Highly recommended.","This course is definitely one of the best courses I have ever taken. It succeeds in teaching the students an extensive amount of material in a very brief time. I shopped all sections for this course, and I must say that professor Dalia's teaching enthusiasm really separates her from others. She is so sincere and understanding towards her students. She is always seeking for ways to make learning a language that is as difficult as Arabic fun. Her energy combined with our TF Lisbeth's organization skills renders learning the language much easier than it would be otherwise. As a non-native speaker, Lisbeth is successful at understanding any confusions and difficulties that new learners may face. She presents the Arabic grammar through charts and study sheets that she prepares to facilitate learning. Also the review sessions that she holds before the exams are always very fun and helpful.","Professor Dalia and Lispeth are both excellent instructors. I thoroughly enjoyed learning Arabic in this class.","It's an amazing class, but be forewarned; it does not teach you to speak Arabic! Only reading and writing.","Be ready to work, but it is very rewarding, and you will learn so much!","It is a great class. Do not be intimidated! The teaching staff is very helpful and you learn a very important skill.","it will be very rewarding but very demanding","Very very fast paced class, do not fall behind because it will snowball until you feel completely lost, stay on top of your stuff and do all the homework and you should be fine","Pretty challenging, but pretty rewarding. Great class overall; at the end of the semester you'll come away with a solid grasp of elementary Arabic. The teaching staff do a great job of making sure that you are keeping up with the lessons; make sure to go to office hours!","This course is challenging, but your performance is directly linked to how much work you put into the class. If you complete the homework, attend class, and engage with the material, you will do very well.","Be warned: if you do not have previous experience with Arabic (or a similar language, such as Hebrew), you will find this difficult. This is not for those of you looking to fulfill you language requirement. And one year of this will not leave you in any state to communicate with a native speaker. That said, Arabic is a beautiful language and I have enjoyed the challenge. If you're considering taking it, I think that speaks for itself. If you're on the fence, consider how much time you're willing to dedicate to it. The class itself is five days a week, with homework every night, and the language itself will take you years to get. Personally, I loved the class, it's just not something that you can take lightly.","It is important that you don't just do the bare minimum to get by. Studying for the test won't help you learn the language."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"8.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"58","response rate":"77.59","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARABIC A","course_id":"3738","cat_num":"5773","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"19","5s":"22"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ARABIC A","course_id":"3738","cat_num":"5773","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"22","5s":"14"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARABIC A","course_id":"3738","cat_num":"5773","1s":"1","2s":"11","3s":"21","4s":"4","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
