However, while my writing improved over the semester, I feel that I could have used some more guidance during section. Additionally, there is not much feedback on response papers.","The course is very interesting. Class discussion is a little formal, but you will get to discuss relevant and provoking issues concerning social media and politics.","Some of the readings are difficult to get through; however, the class is run in a relaxed manner and the preceptor actually focuses on the content of your essay rather than nitpicking details\/complex grammar\/formatting.","Skim the readings, but focus on the style rather than the content. It is easy to get absorbed into the interesting government aspects though you will be graded on your ability to reproduce a form of composition as opposed to your understanding of the theories.","Students who take this class generally have a very strong interest in the political sciences field. They are interested in actively finding ways to improve democracy as it is used today. This class requires a lot of outside reading and a commitment to applying both outside reading and class discussion to its essays.","This class is a great choice for expos. Yascha is an awesome preceptor who will really help you improve as a writer. Both the readings and the assignments are all very interesting and intellectually stimulating. The grading is fair and the feedback on your writing is comprehensive. TAKE IT","This class touches on some very interesting ideas regarding technology and democracy. The concepts are important, but the focus is definitely on writing convincing arguments.","I think students must have a pretty strong interest in this type of material or obviously will not come out with the best experience. The readings are often times pretty lengthy so you must like this topic.","Yascha is a good preceptor and knows a lot about his subject and how to write well. Just know that he has a very specific view of what constitutes good writing and getting good grades often means fitting that view as opposed to necessarily writing better. The class discussions and readings are well thought out and interesting.","This class is a great combination of improving your writing and still learning a lot of content about a specific topic. I would highly recommend it. Yascha provides very detailed and thorough feedback on  essays and the readings he chose are the types of readings that I can see myself coming back to in the future. They weren't very long readings and I really enjoyed them. Most people say that they dislike expos, but it was actually my favorite class this semester. Class discussions were engaging and Yascha was a good moderator to guide the thoughts of the class when they became disorganized. If you're interested in politics or technology, this expos is for you"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.246","course_id":"11481","cat_num":"92306","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"6","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.246","course_id":"11481","cat_num":"92306","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.246","course_id":"11481","cat_num":"92306","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
