If you want to learn Irish, take this course, and you will learn it. Be aware that not only is the course load heavy, but the language itself is tricky; at times it will seem almost deliberately so. While the reward is ultimately worth the effort, don't go into the Irish program thinking you can coast.","This is a great language and really well taught class- It's definitely worth taking more than one semester."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Irish is the most entertaining and satisfying (not that I feel spiritually uplifted, I just always feel really happy when I'm in the class) class I've taken at Harvard.  It's the only class I've never dreaded going to.","This class was fantastic! It's very small so you get to know your classmates. Classes are fun and rarely feel like work, even while you're learning a considerable amount about a new and interesting language.","If you are interested in the Irish language, this is certainly a great class to take. But be ready to have to review very regularly throughout the course, as this class constantly builds on what has already been learned in Basic Irish. Nonetheless, the class is very interactive, there's a great teaching staff, and if you are willing to put the work in, it's a rewarding experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"4","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"IRISH 133r","course_id":"454","cat_num":"6689","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"IRISH 133r","course_id":"454","cat_num":"6689","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"IRISH 133r","course_id":"454","cat_num":"6689","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
