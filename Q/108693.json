You don't need to have a background in classics, but make sure you're interested in art or you might find the class a bit slow. But Staehli is great and really enthusiastic!","Take any classes that Professor Staehli offers. Amazing class with an amazing professor and very manageable workload, you will benefit from this class so much.","Professor Staehli really cares about his students and will give great feedback. Coming in with little to no knowledge on the material is no problem - there were grad students in the course, but Professor did a great job of teaching at a pace and depth comfortable and interesting for everyone. If you are interested in the subject, definitely take this!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CLASARCH 101","course_id":"4960","cat_num":"50105","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CLASARCH 101","course_id":"4960","cat_num":"50105","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CLASARCH 101","course_id":"4960","cat_num":"50105","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
