The first few lectures seemed very slow for anyone with a little neuroscience background. The pace then picked up, and the midterm exam was tough but fair. After the midterm, the class became much less organized and it was hard to know what we were supposed to get out of the lectures.","Lack of organization , student must be proactive","strongly recommended","Take this course: electrophysiology will be a lot more intuitive to you after that as opposed to reading general textbook descriptions."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["You will learn how neurons integrate inputs and what makes one neuron in one brain region so different from another in a different region.","it was hard but you have to take it so suck it up and just do the work and try to learn as much as you can.","This course is how a bio course should be taught.","This class is great if you would like to understand neurophysiology on a very general level- or a very extensive level. You can take what you want from it- whether that be how to read an electrophysiology trace, or more detailed information on all the different types of channels expressed in the brain.","It's just lovely. Very, very interesting.","This course seems like a great introduction to neurophysiology when one has little background in the subject, even if they are well-versed in other areas of neuroscience.","Basic introduction to neurophysiology with some more advanced topics in the end.","First half sucks, second half is great, don't take unless you're really interested in electrophysiology.","Good course. Physiology isn't really my thing but I definitely learned a lot.","If you are well prepared in this area, much of it may feel pedantic and slow. If you're not, much of it may feel like it's going over your head. In either case, students I talked with felt like the class helped them understand basic principles and critically engage with papers."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The class isn't easy, and parts of it are definitely frustrating (both for the difficulty of the concepts and for the occasionally dubious way in which those concepts are taught) but it's probably about the best formal training in cellular neurophysiology as anyone is likely to find.","Solid class","Keep up with the work and ask questions along the way whenever you are confused so as not to fall behind, then the course will be very rewarding.","This is undoubtedly the best introductory course to neurophyiology I have ever taken.","This class is highly recommended for anyone interested in neurophysiology. It's definitely recommended for anyone interested in neuroscience, but it may sometimes be frustrating to go so in depth into topics that aren't broadly applicable.","This is probably all information that is necessary for you to know if you want to pursue a career in neuroscience.

A strong background in neuroscience is not required, but would be very helpful. A supplementary textbook may also be helpful if you don't understand concepts from class.","challenging but worth it at the end","I enjoyed this class a lot! A rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the subject.","Nice equilibrated class, which starts with a bit of biophysics and ends on solid, modern techniques in neurophysiology.","I learned more from this class in 3 months than I learned in 3 years in a neurophysiology lab. It was totally awesome dude.","This course is not perfect, but it's as good as it can get. Take it.","I'd recommend people working with neurophysiology to take this class. It seems no matter what level you are in, you'll still have something to learn here. The professors are really nice to discuss with, even about your own research."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"8.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"26","response rate":"73.08","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 220","course_id":"3351","cat_num":"2141","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"7","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 220","course_id":"3351","cat_num":"2141","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"12","4s":"12","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 220","course_id":"3351","cat_num":"2141","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
