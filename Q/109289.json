If you're interested in learning about major important industries in the world today, definitely take this class. Even if you think you might be interested, take it! Lectures were very interesting and Professor Scherer is super enthusiastic and approachable. The course requirements are also very reasonable.","Fascinating material, but difficult and sometimes unclear assignments. Also easy to fall off-track with readings","A really good economics class that is paper oriented but if you are to be a consultant is a very important thing to learn.","Great course but too bad it won't be offered anymore","I'm not sure if the class will be taught again, but if it is, take it! It's a fairly painless way to learn a great deal about a number of different industries. Professor Scherer is the man and and makes class enjoyable. He injects a bit of humor and his own personal opinion into the course material, and he seemingly is an expert on everything. The readings were great - there was a good mix of more academic data intensive readings along with more 'popular' readings, like the kind found in the Economist or Forbes. The combination helps place the data in context and gets the point across. Two papers during the semester of about 5 pages each, with a final exam or a final paper. The topics were interesting and relevant to issues policy makers face today, and you can pick your topic for the final paper if you choose to write it. I don't know if there is a professor on campus who reads our assignments with as much care as Scherer does. He even scrutinizes your references page!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.44","workload":"1.88","difficulty":"3.06","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"18","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1620","course_id":"5281","cat_num":"90055","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"9","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1620","course_id":"5281","cat_num":"90055","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"12","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1620","course_id":"5281","cat_num":"90055","1s":"3","2s":"12","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
