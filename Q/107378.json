Ripley as his teaching is excellent and he creates a very comfortable classroom environment conductive to learning.","Take it! It's wonderful."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Take Burmese! Charlie Carstens is one of the nicest, most helpful teachers I've ever had. I really enjoyed learning from him.","Considering the lack of textbook for this class and the fact that it was taught for the first time this semester, I commend Veronika for her efforts in teaching; she was always very understanding. There are improvements to be made in terms of the consistency and content of this course, but I am very confident that Veronika will make these changes over time. She has a lot of potential as a teacher.","I would suggest this course to any students interested in learning Burmese. As with any beginner language, the material is hard, but the class is fun and engaging and allows students to learn without being overly stressed about it. The quizzes and assignments help greatly in terms of mastering the material. By the end of the semester, I felt so accomplished because of all that I had learned.","The class size was small so the instructor paid more attention to our individual progress, adjusting the materials used and the syllabus accordingly. The instructor was also creative in using different methods to spur us to talk in the language.","This is a great introduction to Indonesian language, with a focus on grammar and building vocabulary.","Take this class. Burmese is offered only at one or two other places in the US, and the chance to learn from someone as experienced and helpful as Charlie is rare! There are plenty of reasons to learn the language when Burma is changing so rapidly, but beyond that, the language is beautiful in itself, and you won't kick yourself for putting a small seminar in among all those anonymous lecture classes and sections."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I would recommend this course for anyone wanting to learn Burmese! Although an obscure language, I learned so much in this course about Burma, history, and culture. It was the perfect environment to begin studying the language and it has instilled within me a deep desire to continue to pursue Burmese.","I think learning Burmese with Charlie is an incredible experience. He is very patient and very good at explaining things. He is able to cover two years worth of material in one year without overwhelming students. Really recommend this.","I hadn't taken a language course in years and forgot how much time is required to memorize vocabulary. While the instructor was accommodating, I would not recommend this challenging of a language course on top of graduate studies."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Practice using the language as much as possible. You get lots of opportunities to do this in class.","A great course to take if you have spent time in South Asia or are interested in working there on day.","Indonesian language tutorial is a great opportunity to learn one of the most spoken languages in the world in an intimate setting, where you don't have to feel uncomfortable or like the class is leaving you behind."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SAS 100r","course_id":"4768","cat_num":"78249","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SAS 100r","course_id":"4768","cat_num":"78249","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SAS 100r","course_id":"4768","cat_num":"78249","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
