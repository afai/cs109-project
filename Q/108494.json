I hoped to learn a lot about a topic I was interested, and felt that I came away knowing a lot about something very obscure without having produced research which was truly worthwhile.","Go for it - good course","That they should've taken it under O'Donovan.","This course was a great experience, you learn a lot but still enjoy an encouraging environment."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This course tested my artistic and literary limits. As a research seminar, I learned about book history research, which was new and exciting. Be aware that the expectations for the course are higher than expected.","For any humanities student, this is the best course you can take at Harvard. It is utterly unlike any course offered, perhaps anywhere in the world. You'll be asked to do imposing amounts of reading and writing, but the assignments are creative and the reading excellent. Professor Lepore and Price are two of the most outstanding professors at this fine institution and they bring immense energy and insight to the class. Challenge yourself - take this course.","The assignments require creativity and research.  The professors take turns reading and grading your assignments themselves, and their feedback is both fair and instructive.  Creative aspects are held to as rigorous standards as analytical ones.  The readings, while interesting, do not fully get tied in to overarching questions on the nature of books.  Field trips to the Bow & Arrow Press and the Cambridge Burying Ground do lend surprising insight to the conversation.  Not your typical history or literature course, which I loved."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 84e","course_id":"2369","cat_num":"90475","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 84e","course_id":"2369","cat_num":"90475","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 84e","course_id":"2369","cat_num":"90475","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
