Professor Mansfield shows the impact each philosopher has on contemporary thought, an aspect of the class that I found most fascinating.","It's a really good course if you're willing to put the work into understanding the philosophers yourself, since the guidance the course provides is mainly on a pretty advanced level.","wonderful and interesting look at the intellectual evolution of humankind reflected in governing practices.","Prof. Mansfield is the consummate lecturer. Between his vast learning and his remarkable sense of humor, you'll never leave this class unstimulated.","I would recommend this course only if a different professor taught it.  The material is interesting, but Prof. Mansfield is not.","You could learn a ton, but if you don't have at least an hour a day to devote to readings, then you will have a lot of trouble keeping up.","When Mansfield isn't being self-consciously un-PC (which happens less than 15% of the time), he delivers intelligent, united commentaries that help you appreciate some really great texts.","It's worth taking this class just to listen to Mansfield talk for a term.  To be exposed to someone so intimately fluent with the material is really something.","take if you are interested.  i would recommend taking with Professor Mansfield","Mansfield's lectures are remarkable, and the thinkers that this course addresses are important ones to know.  I had a great experience in this class.  It was particularly fun to try to discern what Mansfield really thought about the thinkers he was describing -- He would make statements from their perspective at times, and it was difficult to know what was really going through his head...","Try to stay on top of the reading. Even if finishing all of it on time isn't crucial to doing well in the course, the readings are central to Western thought and important to have under one's belt.","This is a great philosophy class with interesting political implications interwoven.  The overview of philosophy of each of the authors is a great way to get into this kind of subject matter.","It's a good grounding in political philosophy from the Renaissance to the present, and the ideas in there are still batted around in politics today.","Fantastic reading list, Mansfield's lectures offer a way to understand and interpret material, but are not central to appreciating course. It is as if one is reading an ongoing piece of criticism along with the texts except that Mansfield is reading aloud.","make sure that the topic interests you","This class is very rigorous and at times the lectures are very dense, but it was also very rewarding. Don't take it to boost your self-esteem, but do take it to consider the last 500 years of political thought in a critical and insightful light.","take it - it is really good","This course places you face to face with the leading modern philosophers.  Prof Mansfield guides you through this difficult material, but does not filter it.","This course is very interesting, by the very fact that it is taught by Professor Mansfield. It offers a decent grounding in modern political philosophy and a forum for practicing philosophical argumentation.","If you're interested in political philosophy, this class is a must.  Be ready to read A LOT though."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Might perhaps have been better with Prof. Mansfield.","That it is very interesting and the work-load is not too heavy.","take it if you're interested in the reading list","A great introduction the canon that lets you trace certain key themes - particularly the theme of history - through the history of western thought.","This was an excellent course with an excellent coverage of material.","Great class! Great opportunity to read all of the canonical thinkers that social studies concentrators like to think they're the only ones who have read. Nice in developing your cocktail party\/cultural reference knowledge bank. I did not mind the formal lecture style, but it might not be your thing.","This class is difficult due to the expansive reading list. However, I personally found all the reading engaging and liked doing most of the work for the class. Therefore, the difficulty of the class canceled out to some extent by the fact that I really enjoyed the class.","don't worry about writing down everything she says!","Prepare to work hard and learn alot!  The syllabus consists of books that everyone should read during college.","Leave yourself enough time to do the readings properly!","For those with a background in political philosophy or those willing to work very very hard, this course will be useful. Nonetheless, this is not a course that one can expect to slack off in, or even put in an average amount of effort, and expect anything less than serious consequences.","Great class, great professor, great sections.  What could be better than having such wonderful people guide you through some of the greatest philosophical works of all time?","If you're a freshman, do not take this course. I was confused and overwhelmed by all the ideas and theories in the course. The workload is not bad, but a lot of your grade depends on your understanding and discussion of the reading, and to me, it was really hard to understand anything, therefore hard to participate.","Only take this course if you are actually interested in this subject. The reading is too dense and the assignments too specific (and un-bull-shit-able) for someone who doesn't actually have a vested interest in learning about political philosophy.","The class has an extensive reading list but it consists of the seminal works of modern political philosophy.","You have to be self-motivated or else you will get overwhelmed by the amount of reading.","Try to understand larger thematic patterns between authors as you go.","this class teaches the foundation of political philosophy today and is something that at least all gov concentrators, if not all students should study.","Only for those who can come to terms with Prof. Rosenblum's lecturing syle.","Even though I learned I'm more interested in the policy than the theory, I think this is one of those courses you ought to take at some point in your educational career.","Professor Rosenblum is a great lecturer.","This class is a very good introduction to modern political thought.  I would recommend Rosenblum's version in particular for those who want a thoughtful overview of the thinkers and the different ways of interpreting them.","A LOT of reading. But interesting stuff. Very good especially for a moral reasoning core.","This course introduces you to major political thinkers whose writings most people will not be able to read and fully grasp without further instruction. Professor Rosenblum's lectures are truly illuminating, and provide a good entry into political philosophy. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard!","The material is interesting, and it is a relatively painless way to fulfill a Moral Reasoning requirement (especially if you are more interested in understanding major historical philosophers rather than moral reasoning per se), but Professor Rosenblum's lectures are delivered in such a boring way that there is very little incentive to go to class.","Much easier to synthesize the thinkers and draw links between them (which is the overall point of this) if you spend a couple of days reading an introduction to political thought, perhaps Wolff or something.","Easy and fairly interesting.","Difficult for beginners; proceed with caution.","It's a wonderful, fascinating class, with great instructors but be warned that the reading load is very very heavy.","This is a really great class, if you want exposure to the canon of modern political thought.","This class has a heavy reading load. It will expose you to some of the greatest thinkers in philosophy.","well-structured, foundational"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Be prepared to give your life up.","Mansfield's the man.","This course is a wonderful introduction (though not basic at all) to modern political philosophy - it is comprehensive and broad, while Prof. Mansfield provides material that is detailed and nuanced.","Professor Mansfield is a wizard at the lectern, donning the role of defense attorney for each philosopher to present an intelligent survey of a wide spectrums of thinkers from the western tradition. Though the emphasis is on 7 thinkers, Professor Mansfield ties in references well to other related important thinkers. Even though I myself was unfamiliar with the philosophical tradition of the ancients, Professor Mansfield made them comprehensible in context. The end of the course feels a bit rushed from Hegel on, but overall the detail of coverage on each thinker is excellent.","this is the longest standing and best course at harvard university.  it will challenge you in every way to new heights.  if you would like to know more about yourself and the gears that turn the world, don't hesitate.    \r\n\r\n\r\nmansfield is a god.","Mansifeld doesn't simply explain the philosohers, rather he philosophizes on them--something you can either like or dislike. I disliked it. Also, the readings are extremely interesting, but too much: you never go deep enough into them.","This course will be one of the hardest you take at Harvard, but it is a rewarding study of a 'bucket-list' of political theorists.","This class is necessary for anyone interested in the great books or Western intellectual thought. Professor Mansfield is the preeminent political philosopher of our time, and I would recommend this, his flagship course, for all students.","If you ever want to be a leader -- not the kind that college applications seduce you into being, but the real kind, someone who makes history -- you NEED to take this class.","This class seemed interesting at first, but quickly became stagnant, boring, and monotonous. The readings are interesting but so heavy that the TFs even suggest skimming, and there is a strong lack of useful feedback on papers.","Great way to \"get educated\" on a lot of important thought.","Government 1061 is a course everyone should take before graduating.","Hard, lot's of reading, but worth it.","You'll enjoy this class if you like talking about big ideas - the way the world is and should be.  It's definitely not focused on current leaders, legislation, or politics, though.  You'd better know how to read and study strategically (skimming, finding good synopses online, getting the TA to give you an idea of what you'll be discussing or writing about) or you'll be swamped by this ten-inch course (that's how much space it takes up on the bookshelf!).  Get the little \"Guide for Students\" optional book, it helps get the big picture on what the prof thinks.","You need to be able to give the readings a lot of time, so you can really process their thoughts in connection with lecture and section. Otherwise, you're wasting your time.","Take it for the reading.","Do all of the reading and take your time with it.","Take this class if you have the courage. Take this class if you don't want to waste your Harvard career taking classes that are fluff from professors who are fluff.","This course actually teaches you something about yourself and the world.  It is one of the few non-science courses with substantial content.  I would add that one will not feel belittled by this course in the way that so many other courses treat students like adolescents.","The topic is interesting, but the lectures are difficult to follow and are of limited help in putting the readings into proper context. We got the instructor's take on a lot of the readings without the first step of getting the basic knowledge about the readings that should precede interpretations.","Note the passages that Mansfield references in lecture - they will be worth your repeated perusal.","This is a fantastic but difficult class. Professor Mansfield is wonderful and, though his political reputation is well-known, does not make an issue of his politics to any noticeable extent. His knowledge of the material and his clarity are noteworthy even at Harvard. Lectures are very good and provide multiple opportunities to ask questions. Be prepared to, throughout the course, get low-for-Harvard grades because of the ironic\/real grading system, but fear not, for it balances out in the end. TFs are also near-uniformly fantastic. Take this class!","You need to take this course. The readings are all things you need to know before graduating from Harvard. The lectures are fascinating.","This was a great course, I just wish I had taken 1060 first.","Mansfield's lectures on Machiavelli in the beginning of the course were by far the most interesting and most engaging part of the course. He is rather disorganized and confusing, but often fun to listen to.","Mansfield's lectures are worth going to. Everything else about this course is a disaster.","This is an excellent course. The content is interesting, indeed essential to the informed participant in Western politics and culture; and the presentation is terrific. Professor Mansfield is an excellent teacher, always informative and always interesting. The pace of the course does not allow you to linger, but the speed is necessary to cover 400 years of political thought in one semester. Be prepared to think a lot and think even more.","You must be prepared to grapple with the tedious detail of each of the philosophers. Mansfield can be obscure, though taking good notes will really help.","Be prepared to work hard and to have a tough time deciphering Mansfield's lectures.","Mansfield's politics are troublesome, and I would not necessarily disagree with accusations of sexism and racism. So I'm of two minds in regards to recommending this course. But the lectures are really excellent, and the books are absolutely worth reading. I learned a lot, not just about the subject itself, but about how to read and think about dense, challenging books.","Be prepared to be reading more than you ever have for another course - difficult, demanding, dense reading. But it's very rewarding.","The syllabus for this course includes all of the essential reading in modern political philosophy.  If being enrolled in the class motivates you to read these great works, then it is well worth your time.  However, the lecture itself is not particularly valuable.  The class is oriented toward memorizing the philosophy of each writer rather than learning how to critically analyze it or formulate your own ideas.","Do the reading. Twice.","Take it as a freshman, but realize that you will be at the bottom of the class, that you will be at a disadvantage, and your life will be consumed by the readings and your analysis of them if you want to do well. However, as a freshman, you will have a clear advantage over your peers having learned the material, and you will be able to write any bad grades off as freshman year mix-ups.","The reading list alone is worth taking this class for.","Fantastic class - books are great and Mansfield is a clear but sophisticated lecturer.","This is one of the few truly challenging humanities courses at Harvard. Merely on that basis, it's worth taking.","I think this is a class all Harvard undergrads should take. It will be rewarding and provocative no matter what your political views are going into the class.","Most infuriating course at Harvard. Mansfield is a terrible professor who seems more interested in demonstrating his own knowledge than in helping his students are learning. I would NOT recommend this course to anyone. Even having taken (and done well in) theory heavy courses like Social Studies 10, I had no clue what Mansfield was talking about most of the time and hated every moment of lecture."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["**If you are considering taking this course or Gov 10 (or some course like that) TAKE THIS COURSE.  Stop worrying about your GPA and Harvey C Minus Mansfield and remember you are at the finest learning institution in the world.  It's time to challenge yourself.  \r\n\r\nOne thing I wish I'd known- if you get 100% on the identifications on the final Mansfield buys you a bottle of scotch. READ.","If you want to learn about philosophy, politics, morality, or really anything pertaining to the theory of the human condition I'd say this is a class to take. It's one of those few classes that can clearly be said to make you a better person and citizen of the world.","Tons of reading. The exam is a bitch.","Keep up with the reading load, take detailed notes in lectures, and ask Prof. Mansfield questions!  He's a genius, and you'll appreciate his thorough lectures.","This is not an easy Government class, but it is also better than the average Government class. The reading list is excellent, and the format of the course forces you to seriously grapple with each author's argument. The section component of the course delves into each author individually in order to help you fully understand their arguments. Mansfield's lectures are distinctive in that they don't really explain the readings to you; he bases himself on the idea that you already understand most of the argument. As thus, they will probably not be helpful if you haven't done the readings correctly, but they'll be crucial if you want to understand the nuances of each author as well as the links between their arguments. By the end of the course, you'll have a deeper insight into the development of political ideas and how philosophers branch off\/build on one another's work. With three 5-page papers, the bulk of the class is just keeping up with the readings. The pages are mostly a preparation for the final - which looks really hard and will probably kick my ass next week. Mansfield has a big reputation but he is actually very approachable, nice, and eager to answer everybody's questions in lecture. I don't think minorities should shy away from his class, but they should brace themselves for \"politically-incorrect\" comments such as calling Native Americans \"the Red Indian\". I recommend this class; I took it as an elective Gen-Ed and enjoyed myself more than if I had simply taken an \"easy\" or \"lightweight\" Gen-Ed instead.","This class is interesting and engaging and can connect to many different courses of study at Harvard in different ways. My experience in the class, however, was strongly connected to a very positive experience with my section TF. Without his contribution, the lectures themselves, though interesting, may not have sustained my interest in the class as well.","Professor Mansfield is a tour de force -- amazing lectures (among them the best I've ever heard here at Harvard).  You're doing a disservice to yourself if you pass up the chance to engage with these texts and with Mansfield's understanding of them sometime during your undergraduate career.  Truly incredible.","You must take this class! The readings are fundamental to political and philosophical thought, Professor Mansfield brings an innovative perspective, and section (with Jonathan) was very helpful. True, it's a lot of reading, but it's an intellectually exciting reading load that will keep you thinking for the rest of your life. Lecture is fast-paced, and every sentence is important. I think this course should be required for graduation, especially in the social sciences\/studies and humanities... Few courses are on par with this one.","Be ready for a lot of reading, but if you are into deeper questions, you will really enjoy this course. It doesn't focus on details, but talks about the bigger questions of life and politics, and focuses on philosophizing instead of memorizing","It's a lot of hard work and difficult reading but is worth it if you're even remotely interested in political philosophy.","You gotta take this class at Harvard. No kidding. Real philosophy for the inquistive who wonder about why the world is the way it is now. Be prepared to have your deepest assumptions challenged.","A great class, incredible content. Professor Mansfield is a legend. Take this class if you want to be a leader - probably as close to a \"great books\" class as you will get at Harvard.","Without a doubt, the best lecture course I have taken in my four years at Harvard. Don't miss the opportunity to take it before you graduate.","Try to stay on top of the readings...it's tough to catch up once you fall behind. But otherwise, very rewarding class; you definitely read and learn a lot.","The lectures were not as interesting as I would have liked, which was disappointing because I took the class largely because I had been encouraged to take a class from Professor Mansfield. That said, Professor Mansfield is very knowledgable and knows the subject well. It I had not had an extremely reading heavy schedule this semester, maybe I could have taken more time to fully engage with the reading and would have been able to ask questions of Professor Mansfield and thus take better advantage of the class. However, I did all the readings and attended all the lectures, yet still felt that the vast majority of what I learned from the course was due to section. The course gives a very good overview of the development of modern political philosophy in general however, so for me it was useful background knowledge to apply to other history courses in the future that deal with the same eras.","Take it for the material, everyone should know about these eight modern philosophers. Be prepared to do ~ 80% of the reading and go to TF office hours before writing your short essays","This class is an excellent college experience, albeit very challenging. Readings are difficult, and lectures can often be rather obtuse, but you come out with a very strong foundation in political philosophy and its further study. Definitely make sure you have enough time to devote to this class though - readings are essential!","It is a difficult class, but the content is worth it.","This class is awesome.  You'll do lots of reading but it's fun!","1061 is arguably the best modern political philosophy class here, second only to what is covered in SS10 - it uniquely covers most of the major authors and Mansfield's lectures are always interesting to listen to.","It all comes together as you review for the final.  REad, keep up, and breathe, you're going to love it once you're done!","It's a great class, but definitely try and do all the reading.","This is a great class.  The lectures can be a little inaccessible at times, but section helps a lot with that.  The readings are fascinating (and, also, important), and this class is a great way to get acquainted with some of the heavy-hitters of modern political philosophy.","I put a lot of work into 1061 and got fairly little out.  It promised \"political philosophy,\" but it was short on both debate and political relevance.","Although it is hard, if you're interested in philosophy you have to take the course."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["For anyone with an interest in politics who does not have a background in theory, this is a must-take course. This being said, if you've taken Social Studies 10 already, there is no need to bother. If you're hesitating between the two, it really depends on your interests. If you're wholly indifferent, I would recommend Social Studies 10; the formation is more complete, as some of the authors are read a bit too hastily in this class.","This is a great class and Prof. Rosenblum is a great lecturer. The TFs really made this class as great as it was.","This class is a must-take at Harvard. The works we read in this class are an important foundation for any well-educated person, no matter what your field of expertise or interest.","It will be very hard. But you must take it. I would listen to Professor Rosenblum lecture for hours upon hours, if I could. She is brilliant, the readings will open your mind, you will never again look at society the same way.","Look, I'm Math person yet I loved this course! It does survey interesting authors and if you like to discuss about political ideas from now and then, this is guaranteed to stir up your interest in these topics!","I had no prior experience with politics or philosophy before taking this class, and I am so, so glad I took it! The class is really well-taught and well-organized; the instructors kept the material interesting, but the material itself was chosen so well that I found it fun to discuss anyway! The fact that the philosophy is politics-oriented makes the philosophy less dry and more \"relatable\" (in my opinion), and the fact that the politics part is more philosophy-oriented makes the course less about the nitty-gritty of government, and more about broad ideas -- very interesting. The instructors also make sure to connect many of the ideas to modern governments and political ideas\/movements!","This class is one of the best I've taken at Harvard - if you're interested in political philosophy, take it. I found the readings fascinating (especially those philosophers I'd never really thought about before, like Machiavelli and Nietzsche), the lectures engaging and informative (Prof. Rosenblum is an excellent lecturer), enjoyed the section discussions, and got a lot out of writing the essays.","This is a great way to get a good background in modern Western political theory. If you've taken Social Studies 10a, there will be some overlap--but they complement one another pretty well.","You're probably scared of taking your ER requirement. Its okay, Professor Rosenblum is here with the tenets of modern philosophy to help you understand and love writings from Machiavelli to Nietzsche. Every lecture is high energy and points out the lives, eccentricities, and most important elements of the works that you really shouldn't graduate without reading","It is a great intro to political philosophy.","The philosophers you'll read in this class are very important whether or not you study gov.","It's a great way to understand more about political philosophy! Take it!","This a great class! The readings are interesting, not too heavy, and a solid grounding in political theory. Lectures are engaging and thought-provoking. Sections, obviously, vary depending on the TF, but my section was incredibly relaxed and fun, well-facilitated and interesting. The workload was relatively light - two eight page papers and an exam. No response papers.","This is an incredible course! If you have any interest about why the modern political systems are the way they are, you should definitely take this class. It was certainly one of my favorite class at Harvard so far.","It's a great class but you need to really invest in the day to day work to get the most out of it.","Take this class. Rosenblum is is crazy in the very best way. She's a great lecturer and they're great books. The reading load isn't too heavy: it is totally possible to do all the readings, and you definitely should. The lectures will tell you what you need to know and more, but it is time spent with the books that will make this class.","This is by far the best class I have taken at Harvard. The reading list is, I think, a necessity that undergraduates should be exposed to. If you go into it prepared to work hard the pay-off will be huge.","Anyone who's into politics should think about why they believe what they do about government and people and society and this is a really great class for that.  Go to lecture! You could probably get an A without it, but it's so good, you really don't want to miss it.  It will be the most interesting two hours of your week.","This is a great class. It is a privilege to hear about all these great works from Prof. Rosenblum. She is a very engaging lecturer and always makes interesting and novel arguments.","this should be a gen-ed class--something every student who graduates from Harvard should take. Prof. Rosenblum is great. You will need this information as you continue into life. Midterms and final were both fair. You'll know so much after you take this!","You're going to have to do the readings eventually, so do them on time. This also makes section much more engaging and rewarding.","Absolutely fantastic class dealing with key texts\/thinkers in the Western Canon. Prof Rosenblum is a fantastic lecturer, who really clarifies the works we read and enables students to draw connects between them. Fantastic class! It has it all: brilliant professor and fantastic TFs (Charlie in particular was incredibly knowledgeable and approachable) who really clarify without dumbing down the material, and truly important and great material (key thinkers in political theory).","Only take the class with Rosenblum--she's amazing!","Do your best at keeping up with the reading but more importantly than that go to lecture so you have an idea of what to look for in your readings.","You really should take this course before you graduate...these are incredible philosophers, and you will emerge with a peaked intellectual curiosity about political philosophy and government.  These are the books you always told yourself you wanted to read, but needed the motivation of a class to make you read.  This class makes them fun and interesting to get through, and the conversations they spark are riveting.  Really, all the readings are fascinating, while sometimes a bit difficult to get through and understand.  But Professor Rosenblum's lectures are interesting, enlightening, and engaging, and section is incredibly helpful.  The papers are not too difficult, and are actually kind of fun to write if you engage yourself.  The exam is also nothing terrifying if you study and understand the philosophers' main ideas.  This was an intellectually satisfying way to fulfill the ethical reasoning gen. ed.  (Also, just for perspective, this was my first government class and my first philosophy class, but it wasn't intimidating at all!  Professor Rosenblum and the TFs make a good job of making the material accessible to non gov\/phil people.)","It the best lecture class I have ever taken.","The course is difficult. But it is also extremely rewarding. Not only do you get to brag that you sort of understand all these great thinkers and point out all the mistakes people make when they make one-line references to a particular philosopher (Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Marx, etc.), but you also develop a relationship with the argumentation of each author to see how they reached their conclusions, to understand their nuances. The most fun, though, was seeing the connections between different authors, even when they contradict each other in some other way.","This is a great class to take if you are truly interested in political philosophy and government. Its themes and concepts can often be applied to current politics and political thought. However, there is a significant amount of dense reading which takes a long time to get though. Lectures are quite helpful in identifying what parts of upwards of 200 page reading assignments are important.","Readings are hard, but you gotta take a class like this as a scholar at Harvard- even if you skim the dense readings. This is the political philosophy canon.","If you're interested at all in political theory, you'll love this course. It was a great way to learn material I should know anyway. Just make sure you keep up, even if you don't do the reading. Go to lecture!","Great introductory course for reading all the thinkers you should know about! Be prepared for a ton of reading but lectures were interesting and section was great- the two also rarely overlapped. If you ever wanted to drop Hobbes or Nietzche in a cocktail party conversation, take this class!","Really need to have time to sit in the texts. Reading political theory (Hegel) can be difficult at times, and sometimes, you just need to devote 6 hours of your Saturday to allow the text to come to you.  This class is not the easiest, but it's also not difficult--you just have to be interested in political theory.","Take this class! It's really interesting and you'll learn a lot!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["for grad students, just attend the lecture, not take it for a credit","Great GenEd. Graded assignments are few and not too difficult. Professor Tuck is amazing and really cares about his students. He's simply wonderful.","Although the class can still improve, I think the subject matter makes it inherently interesting to those interested in it - I love political theory and would still want to learn more after taking this course!","Be prepared to read a lot! but all good stuff","Professor Tuck is a fantastic lecturer: he knows his material backwards and forwards, always has an amusing anecdote, and is very receptive to students. This class is really a must.","Great way to satisfy ER requirement; easy without being a waste of your time. I had never been interested in goverment\/politics before and was pleasantly surprised with how interested I was in this material. Totally possible to get by without doing any of the readings (and the reading is somewhat heavy!) but you'll find yourself wanting to do them. I was mostly quite engaged and frequently discussed the material with others. Tuck is great, lectures are entertaining, definitely glad I took it!","I completely forgot that this fulfilled both my Political Theory requirement as a Gov concentrator and my Ethical Reasoning requirement for GenEds -- I would take it even if it had been just an elective. The course is ambitious in its breadth and its depth. However, it does an admirable job of covering some of the most noteworthy thinkers of modern political philosophy and their provocative claims. The course pushes you to think and reflect, and the workload IS reasonable. Professor Tuck is an engaging, humorous speaker, and you too will find this to be a treat!","I loved this course.  That said, this class is a commitment, because if you do not do the readings carefully, you will likely not get very much out of the course. The class discussion varied, and Tuck's lectures can often seem too heterodox for an introductory course (i.e., Marx apparently was \"really just a radical democrat\"), so you need to make sense of some of the material yourself. If you are excited by the reading list, and want some thought-provoking guidance through the material, this is the course for you. Otherwise, if you are just looking for an \"easy Gen Ed,\" take something else.","It's an interesting subject matter, but the lectures are dull.","Interesting readings and lectures.","Great for people who want a crash course on the political thought of the past 500 years, but there is a good bit of reading.","This is a fascinating class- a must-take at Harvard. Professor Tuck is brilliant, a legend, and pretty funny at times. There is a good amount of reading, but it's all philosophical staples that I feel like I have to have read before I leave Harvard.","Great class. A ton of reading, but amazing professor and amazing TF's. You will learn the broad overview of political philosophy since Machiavelli. It's a very interesting class and I think very useful for rounding out an education.","This is an excellent overview of important modern political theory - be ready to read a lot, but the syllabus is amazing.","[BACKGROUND] I took this class because I wanted to fulfill an ethical reasoning gen ed and because I wanted to take a class on Nietzsche and this was the only class that had him on the syllabus. I really liked this class because a lot of what we read felt like theories about living and 'how can we best live our lives?' as much as they were theories about government. Everything felt applicable and there was none of that metaphysical shit (e.g. what is color? Can things exist?) or moral\/ethical stuff (I love relativism). I am very glad I took this class. [ON DIFFICULTY] The readings were really dense, and we got assigned a lot, so I usually stuck to looking up summaries of all the readings. I read the actual assignment if I was feeling really ambitious or if I had a paper due, then I close-read that mofo. You only have 2 papers, which are pretty short, so there isn't a lot of work required of you. Try to get Greg as your TF. I really liked the format of the final exam too (3 essays. You get practice essay questions to review, but they don't tell you what the essay questions will be on the exam) [ON LECTURE] The most important thing to understand is the purpose of lecture for Tuck: he wants to tell us why these authors were writing the things they wrote. What was their historical context? To whom or what were these writings a response? Therefore, don't expect lecture to tell you what these authors were actually saying. [ON DOING WELL] I had an awesome study group. We finished our study guide two days before the exam and got together the day before the exam to go over all the philosophers. I left this class with a solid understanding of everyone we read except for Hegel. I don't know if anyone understood Hegel. [RECOMMENDATION] Take this class! It's really interesting and not that hard!","A rather boring overview of basic political philosophy with little engagement.","Be sure to read actively and re-read if you don't understand something. Putting in the extra time will greatly help in grasping what each philosopher is saying","This class features a plethora of texts one \"should\" read. Section with Sungho was enlightening, and you will leave the course with a good general understanding of each philosopher's main points of political theory. That said, there is a lot of reading, and, while you can get away with skipping much of it, you won't be getting all you can out of the course. Secondly, lecture with Tuck is informative, but he spends the first half of every lecture in rather undirected descriptions of the philosopher's life. While it's interesting, and sometimes useful to understanding the philosophers' thought process, a more nuanced discussion of the philosophy itself is often sacrificed.","If you aren't going to take social studies 10, take this class.  Understanding how modern political thought developed and progressed helps you understand EVERYTHING in modern history.  These thinkers' ideas underpin all sorts of other subjects, from literature to history to science.  If you are looking for a true, general, liberal arts education, this is a class you need to take.  Also, Professor Tuck is terrific, and the teaching staff was knowledgeable and helpful, as well.  A great class in all ways.","Be prepared to read a lot. Sparknotes and wikipedia may be helpful times to times. Pay attention to common themes across the works as these may become important towards the final exam.\r\n\r\nProf. Tuck is a great lecturer - sometimes he digresses but most of the time his digression is pretty entertaining. He may seem a bit difficult to approach","This class is amazing all around.  Tuck's lectures are really substantive, and Tuck is a funny guy.  The TFs know this material well and so sections are valuable.  And you'll learn a lot!","Excellent materials covered in a very logical and orderly way.","If you are looking for a broad survey of many of the greatest political philosophers of all times, this is a great class. The readings are sometimes dense (I'm looking at you, Kant) but overall fascinating; Professor Tuck is also a great lecturer who makes lectures appear like casual conversations, without sacrificing content in the least.","The best books. A great professor, in Tuck. Lectures are on a higher level than any other undergraduate course you would ever take on this subject.","This an excellent class, and a great introduction to political philosophy. Prof. Tuck is a very good lecturer; he's not necessarily high energy, but he explores scholarly debates and historical context in depth, and it is very rewarding to pay attention. Note that it only covers up to Nietzsche, so you'll have to look elsewhere for the 20th century.","This class is a great survey of modern political thought. There is a good amount of reading you'll have to do each week, but it's almost all authors that people will \"expect\" you to have read. Lectures are on the ramble side, but always interesting, if not 100% relevant.","There is a lot of reading, but the TFs do a good job of helping you focus on main ideas so that you're not left floundering in the large amount of material.  It's definitely the kind of class where you get out what you put in.","There is a lot of reading and it's dense, but I loved this course. If he's still teaching, Greg Conti is a fantastic TF: his sections taught me more than the two hours of lectures every week.","Great class, I think it is important for everybody to have taken a look at all of these philosophers and you get a good survey. Tuck tends to meander in his lectures so if you are not paying attention than you can get confused as to what the key points are, but nevertheless he is still a remarkably knowledgeable professor and intriguing to listen to. Greg is a great TF and knew how to answer questions well. Honestly since this is a survey course of famous philosophers I found it really helpful to just take notes on the sparknotes pages just so I understand the main ideas, but then also dive into the original texts to glean quotes- this will make writing your papers and preparing for your final exam much easier. The essay prompts were really short and vague, so I hope that for the future they write better ones that you can actually work with.","If you want to get a solid understanding of some of the classic (and some less well known) political philosophers of the early modern era, this is the class for you. Professor Tuck's lectures are amazing!","The course is an excellent introduction to modern political thought! Richard Tuck knows his stuff as evidenced by his seemingly impromptu lectures. There is a lot of reading, but for good reason. The readings range from Machiavelli to Hobbes to Constant to Marx and so on. This course is difficult due to the material, but definitely worth it.","This is one of those classes at Harvard that even though it is hard and has a lot of work, it makes you feel like you actually accomplished something. You leave the class knowing so much more than before and that is a great feeling! It is definitely not an easy class but it's definitely not a waste of time either.","Be prepared to do a significant amount of reading. Social Studies concentrators will find this class rather easy just given the overlap between the SS10 A and B curriculum and this class, but for individuals without a passion for social and political theory or doing a significant about of reading, stay clear of this class.","This class is one that everyone at Harvard should take. You read important texts, have them interpreted by a leading scholar on them, and get to come up with your own interpretation. Sections are somewhat intense based on who you have, but try and get Sungho - he's an excellent, excellent TF and really cares about his students. Professor Tuck is also very accessible for being such a well-known professor.","If you like history or political philosophy, definitely take this course.","It was one of the best courses I've ever had in college. If you enjoy reading political philosophy and writing about it, I am sure that you will like this class. Prof. Tuck is very passionate.","Pretty interesting and challenging course.","If I were you, I would buy the books rather than using the internet. I wish I had.","If you're a gov concentrator, it's a great way to knock out your political theory sub-field and ethical reasoning gen ed requirements at the same time.  Great readings.  Professor Tuck gives great lectures.  A very manageable workload"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The reading is tough, the grades are lower than you want, the lectures demand your full attention. But this course is a standout even at Harvard--it's the closest thing I've seen to a great books course--and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a rigorous journey through what is in many ways the foundation of thought today. Also: go to Professor Mansfield's office hours. Wow.","Perhaps the most important class I've taken at Harvard. This class is essential for understanding politics and society, and pretty much a \"must take.\" It is as hard a government classes can get, but very rewarding. It challenged the way I think about the world.","Terrible class.  The lectures, while occasionally interesting, are deliberately dense and obscure.  Papers are the worst: they are very stressful, and the grading is ridiculously overparticular and extremely harsh.  The readings (there is also a lot of reading) are admittedly very engaging, but if you are interested I would really just recommend reading them yourself.","This was a really interesting class! Professor Mansfield is very intelligent and will make you appreciate everything we read. One note: this was my Gen Ed (I'm not a philosophy person at all) and parts of it were absolutely over my head.","Great class! Find out why the world is the way it is.","If you have an interest in political philosophy, you'll like it. It's a lot of reading, but if this is your thing, you should find it interesting, since it's all very renowned texts. If you are not really that interested in political philosophy, and you are just using it to fill a requirement, it will likely be a bit of a drag. You need to have a genuine interest to be engaged in this class.","you have a duty to understand this stuff","Invest the added time it takes to read the entire required readings for the class. Lessons from the course will stay with you beyond the end of the semester and help shape your world view, in my opinion something far more important than the grade you get.","Take this course if you feel you can handle some of the hardest (yet most important) philosophers in the world, entirely alone. Lectures were very confusing, always over my head, and I struggled to get a full grasp of the philosophers unless I really spent a lot of time on them in preparing for an essay or the final. The final is a ton of information to go over, but if you study hard, it puts the course together nicely.","Lecture needs to change. Listening to Mansfield ramble on about his own thoughts along with sexist interjections was actually awful for me. I do not think it is ever appropriate to make rape jokes, especially in a class, and Mansfield made several. I found them personally offensive and contemplating complaining to the gov dept. The reign of the old white man is ending and Mansfield should either change his tune or retire. That being said my tf was good and it was interesting to read all the political philosophers. You don't need to attend lecture, so I would recommend not going to save yourself the anger and that deep sinking feeling you get when you listen to the patriarchy.","This is an incredibly challenging course. The readings can be very dense and may make you want to rip your hair out because they are so repetitive and still somehow confusing. But somehow I emerged feeling a sense of pride and look back on this course fondly. Maybe I now just have a distorted sense of gratitude...","This class gives you an understanding of key thinkers in the Western canon. If you've always wanted to learn about them, here's your chance. That being said, it surveys them very quickly and for some more complex thinkers, you know you're missing out on a lot.","Don't take this if you think you 'need to read these books before you graduate.'  There are far more constructive ways to read these texts than Prof. Mansfield's course.  I would, instead, recommend taking his Ancient Political Philosophy course which is better structured, smaller, and a bit more manageable.  This class seemed rushed and uninspired.  Prof. Mansfield's candor can be refreshing, even for us dyed in the wool liberals, but overall, there are professors offering a more enlightening take on modern political philosophy.","Stay on top of the readings but don't feel bad if you can't finish them all, or study them all with the same depth.","This class has quite a few problems. Professor Mansfield's lectures can be confusing and hard to follow. The paper writing is frustrating, since you'll be told that you failed to \"explain why the writer thought a and b\" or \"why c is important for the writer's overall theory\" even though the question does not ask you to do this and the essays are strictly word limited.","The course is a wonderful setting to not only read an incredible range of philosophers, but also gain exposure to Professor Mansfield's unique (and really interesting!) interpretations of classic works. If you have the time to devote to doing the reading, you should definitely take this class. But keep in mind that there is a lot of reading.","This is a great course that comprehensively reviews modern philosophy. If you want to read \"great books\" and have an understanding of the philosophical ideas that have shaped society as it exists today take the course. Beware however, the reading load is heavy and Professor Mansfield, despite being brilliant, can be difficult to follow at times. To make the most of it, commit to reading a lot of philosophy over the term.","Take this class if you already have a basic knowledge of the syllabus and if you are prepared to spend significant amounts of time outside of class reading and synthesizing. If not, you will gain close to nothing from the course. Be prepared to do a lot of the work entirely on your own.","Students should be ready to do a large amount of reading and should go into the class knowing that they enjoy philosophy. Also, they should be prepared to deal with Mansfield's difficult lecture topics.","Stay away from it unless a different professor and TF were to teach it.  I think I would have enjoyed the class much more if I did not feel as if I were way over my head.  There are no lecture notes or videos that you have access to for the class.  It is an hour and a half twice a week and it is very hard to follow the lecture without lecture notes.  There's a ton of reading and it's hard to do well if you don't read unless you do a ton of sparknoting and research into the topics. It is frustrating and takes a lot of time.  If you have the time and really enjoy philosophy, take it, but make sure not to take other heavy reading classes at the same time.  The material is interesting but dense and you really have to read slowly\/sit with it to absorb.  it is harsh grading.","Really great class if you have any interest in political philosophy.  It is pretty difficult, but not to be missed!","Difficult course, mainly because of the volume and complexity of readings. But don't let that deter you.  Everyone at Harvard should take this course.","This is probably the best class you could take at Harvard. Mansfield is a legend, and the books for this course are books no serious student should graduate without having read. Do not let Mansfield's conservative reputation deter you from taking this class. Unlike most Harvard professors, Mansfield keeps politics out of the classroom. \r\nI would, however, recommend taking this class after you've already taken an intro political theory class, as the lectures are very in-depth.","Joe was a wonderful TF and was so much help during section, especially because there was SOO much reading to do for this course (beware). Overall, the TFs for the course were great. Too bad I can't say the same for the lecture component of the course. It's pretty easy to trail off during lecture. Having to listen to Mansfield's \"interesting\" comments\/jokes was borderline uncomfortable and took away from the initiative to put effort into the course. The material itself is super interesting but its not delivered in a dynamic form that keeps you engaged during lecture. Quite unfortunate I'd say."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"58","response rate":"77.59","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1061","course_id":"2204","cat_num":"5035","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"14","4s":"14","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1061","course_id":"2204","cat_num":"5035","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"11","4s":"26","5s":"8"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1061","course_id":"2204","cat_num":"5035","1s":"1","2s":"16","3s":"15","4s":"10","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
