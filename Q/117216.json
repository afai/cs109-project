I found the structure of the course to be very fulfilling (three assignments, then a final), and would recommend that to students.","Be prepared for a fluctuating schedule--because the class is structured such that students complete five total projects over the course of ten weeks and because cameras are shared in pairs, it works out that you can't do any work one week but will spend many, many hours completing a project start to finish the next.  One way around this is to use home movies or found footage, but it's just something to keep in mind.  This is especially true of the final project--plan ahead and start early!"]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It's the most fun course I've taken so far.  It will expose you to new kinds of film and inspire you to experiment too!","Absolutely!","This class is great for learning about the powers of the medium of film."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["I would say that this class is at times difficult and frustrating, but overall it provides a rewarding creative experience.","unless you have a strong interest in experimental film, you might get easily bored."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Simply splendid intermediate video course.  Robb and George are fantastic.  Shorter projects are a good opportunity to push your boundaries and step out of your comfort zone.","Freedom and flexibility are the key words for this course. Come in with project ideas in mind for the interview and enjoy the flexibility to accomplish them in a way that matters to you. Work on projects that have impact and develop your skills as a filmmaker and don't feel restricted by a set of assigned projects.","Robb, George, and this course in particular will not make you a great filmmaker. It will however lead you on the way to understanding what you want to do, shoot, and become. This will go down as one of my best courses."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 152r","course_id":"5208","cat_num":"8012","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 152r","course_id":"5208","cat_num":"8012","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 152r","course_id":"5208","cat_num":"8012","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
