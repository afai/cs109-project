Your topic will probably change over the course of the semester, but it's only by reading more and more that you'll get a better sense of what, exactly, you're trying to say.","Compared to junior tutorials in other concentrations, this course walks you through the research paper writing process with relative ease.","This class is great- but make sure you write about something you really enjoy, something you would want to learn about for fun.","I mean, anyone who is a History of Science concentrator has to take it, but I would tell them that it really is a good class that helps your writing and best of all- you get to write about anything you want!!!!","Writing a 25 pg paper is a pain in the butt, but it's a good thing to do if you're thinking about writing a thesis.","Work hard early, or you'll regret it later.","The work you need to put into this is tough, but the results can be rewarding.","This course introduced me to how exciting research could be, and made me more confident that I could write a 30 page paper and truly contribute a new piece of research to the field.","You have to take it.","This course is the reason to be a History of Science concentrator. You get to work on topics that interest you with guidance from amazing TFs and access to all of the professors of the department for guidance. While a 30 page paper may seem daunting, it will be one of the most rewarding experiences of your time at Harvard when you look back.","Really difficult, especially towards the end, because you just have to sit there and get it done! In order to be successful you have to stay on top of assignments. I took this class with two other very difficult classes and that was a poor move, because I spent basically every waking moment in the library this semester, and even though I liked this class I also enjoy free time.","If you are a history of science concentrator thinking about writing a thesis, this class will help you to understand what that would entail. You will get a better sense of whether you want to write a thesis, and of how you would go about doing so.","this class is a great intro to writing long papers","Find a topic that really interests you and writing the final paper will be tremendously fun despite the difficulty.","It is difficult, but it definitely teaches you a lot about how to do research, and it's very useful for helping you decide whether you'd like to write a thesis\/preparing you for one.","This course will succeed in its intent to prepare you to write a thesis.  Be sure the thing you research is something you want to read about every day.","It's great for any history of science concentrators, you can really learn a lot about a specific topic you are interested in.","In this class you have an opportunity to write a very cool research paper.  Most people in your section will approach the junior paper with realistic goals, while some will suddenly think they are top scholars in their field.  This is incredibly annoying.","If you take this course it will teach you how to write a strong, long research paper.  But be prepared - it take a lot of work & is very time consuming if you want to do well.","This research tutorial is a really great way to learn a great deal about a topic of your choosing. The department is very supportive in this endeavor and it is a fun and interesting process.

The way that the course spreads everything out for you leaves far too much time open for searching for your topic and researching (without giving any real advice as to how to do that most efficiently) and not nearly enough time for the actual writing of the paper.","Don't let the first few weeks fool you! The last few are intense!","Junior tutorial is wonderful - I grew so much as a scholar and wholeheartedly recommend this course.","Be Wary.

And pick a topic that you truly find interesting.","very rewarding class. gives you an idea about what writing a thesis is like.","This class was a really challenging but great experience.  Working in groups and one on one with your TF is a great way to navigate the process of writing a long research paper in a supportive environment - I felt like I had a lot of great resources and peers to talk to throughout, and I hear all the TFs are great.  My TF, Jenna, was especially awesome and super helpful the whole time.  It was a great experience to do my own research in archives and libraries I didn't realize were available to us before this semester (this course helps you learn a lot about campus research options), and put together a piece of original scholarship.  The section meetings are also pretty chill and very fun - you get to be friends with the people in your section, who you peer edit with and go through this whole process with.  You'll definitely have to put in a lot of hours, but this is kind of a bonding experience with your concentration and in my experience, a really rewarding one!","A great class for learning how to write in the history of science. Having the freedom to choose your own topic really makes this class quite enjoyable.","This is a necessary and helpful HistSci requirement. It definitely helps to come to the course with a few areas of interest, topics you want to explore. The course is super useful if you want to do a thesis, but even if you don't it is great to take a crack at serious long-term research. The TFs are great! Make sure you start researching and writing early otherwise it'll bite you in the butt.","Great class. Prepares you well. Teaches you how to write really well. The feedback is great, and the support from your TF is great. It is a significant amount of time\/effort compared to other classes I've taken.","Tutorial is a necessary obstacle. With a little more restructuring and a little more handholding they could effectively make the research paper writing process even less scary. Honestly, the course is manageable if you start early as difficult as that is...","This class will help you to determine whether or not you should be writing a thesis.","As a necessary course for Hist of Sci concentrators, it's a good introduction to writing a substantial piece of research, and is a taste of what will be expected of you for writing a thesis.  The course itself provides a great opportunity for you to find out what your academic interests are, so it can definitely help point you in the right direction for a thesis.  A few suggestions: try and decide upon a topic and start collecting research on it early. The course only gives you about 3 weeks to write a 25 page paper, so it's important you get as much done beforehand as possible. For a lot of us, 3 weeks was simply not enough time.  Also, the work load was very substantial, especially the second half of the semester.","Keep on top of the paper writing process - it's easy to get caught up in the research and forget that, at some point, you have to stop reading and start writing.  Set deadlines for yourself outside of what the course requires in order to get everything done in the least stressful manner.","It is hard work, but you will feel proud of the product you come out with at the end.","This course was definitely a good experience because we had the freedom to do our own research and writing on a topic that really interested us. I felt that the course itself could've been structured better because at the beginning there was basically no work and then suddenly you need to write a 25 page research paper. The section component of the course also wasn't really useful\/helpful most of the time and it seemed like the time could've been spent better doing more productive things."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course was great in order to learn \"how to write\" a History of Science research paper of substantial length and important in exploring potential senior thesis topics.

Overall, a great intro into research-based history of science writing.","Junior tutorial is pretty hard. You pretty much have an assignment every week (although this made writing the final paper a lot a lot easier) as well as a lot of time spent in plenary\/section. Don't take this class too lightly","This tutorial is extremely well-structured, and despite the daunting task of producing a 25-page research paper, was a consistently enjoyable experience. Though it is a concentration requirement, it is nothing to be afraid of, and was ultimately just as successful as the newly updated Sophomore Tutorial. The concentration is just getting better and better.","This class has been revamped from previous versions, but unfortunately is still far from perfect. There are many small assignments, nearly one per week, that do a great job of keeping you on track with your paper. Yet I found that these detracted from the ultimate goal and pushed me along in an unproductive manner: I spent many hours writing and researching for things that I was not confident I would pursue. Additionally, the course lacks the individual focus of other concentrations. Sections are not small enough (~7 people) and the faculty and TFs are not lined up with your specific interests, leaving it to the student to discover nearly everything about their topic and making it supremely difficult to understand the previous literature and current arguments.","This course offers students a terrific opportunity to delve into a topic they find interesting throughout the semester, with excellent support from responsive professors and teaching fellows. Begin early, and approach this paper as your own piece of investigative work. It will be worthwhile.","Selecting your own topic and writing a massive research paper is an excellent endeavor. I felt really accomplished at the end of the term, and I can't overestimate how important that feeling is. The plenary sessions were a bit tedious, but you can sort of ignore that and focus on doing work as an amateur scholar in history of science, which is far more important.","A great opportunity to produce an original research paper on a topic of your choice. The process is spread out over the course of the semester and you receive great feedback throughout.","Plenary is completely unhelpful, but if you luck out with your section TF, you can have a great experience and produce some meaningful work at the end.","This course is a great introduction to research and producing a piece of academic work that is eloquent and that you can be really proud of.","This course is fairly easy, but I would spend the summer thinking very carefully and doing some preliminary reading on your topic. The more you know about what you might want to write before the semester starts, the easier the  process of writing the paper will be.","take research seriously from the get go","Research something you are really interested in! It makes the whole process much easier","Start writing your paper as earlier as possible.","Think of a topic early and try to build it around the primary source material Harvard owns--this will make your research experience much more fulfilling.  Write often; it really does help because you are already familiar with the terms and style you'll want in the final paper, and have chunks you could  use directly in the paper.","Doesn't matter what I say; you have to take it. But it can be fun if you find something that is intriguing!","I was probably the only student who took this class as an elective (I was a joint concentrator and this was my secondary), and I think that it was quite the decision. This class is a lot of work and a constant source of stress, but at the same time, I have learned so much about research and producing a long piece of work. Turning in almost 40 pages of writing is really quite a feat, and you'll feel really proud of yourself at the end of it and ready to handle a thesis or another big project. That being said, in terms of taking it as an elective, don't do it unless you understand exactly why. I didn't have as much time as I should have to put into it, but I took it to become a better writer and that I did.","Get excited to dig into something scientific that you're really, sincerely curious about...","This course was a fun experiment in getting to conduct your own research project, but the plenary sessions were a bit tedious at times. Make sure you stay on top of your assignments, and don't complete them just for completion's sake. Give yourself time to really think about the assignment each week, and try to make all of them build together- your post-thanksgiving will be much more enjoyable if you do!","If you're a HistSci concentrator you have to take this course. The lectures are awful and not even worth going to, but the section is helpful, although an hour too long. The good thing about the course is that it is structured so you can't start the paper too late. That's the best thing I can say about it. It wasn't stressful writing a junior paper that was 7000 words long. That's good course structure.","You'll get a good product, but sometimes the plenary and assignments will be a grind.","This class takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Don't let it intimidate you--but be ready for a challenge. Writing a paper of this magnitude takes good preparation and organization, and this course definitely helps you develop the skills necessary to write an exciting junior paper.","I liked the idea of working toward one final product, and learning new techniques for doing so."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is obviously not optional if you are a hist of sci concentrator, but Meg is GREAT and super helpful with the junior paper!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course is not easy but it's a requirement in the history of science department and you learn a lot by taking it. It also really helps you determine whether or not you want to write a thesis.","Great class to learn about original research. There isn't much to talk about because if you are taking this class you are doing so because you have to. It really depends on how competent your TF is. Mine sadly did not help a whole lot","I loved the process of doing original research, and I had a fantastic TF who really helped me with the writing process, so I loved this course. If you don't like doing this kind of historical research, or if you had a less helpful TF, or both, I imagine that this course would be a real drag.","The research process is difficult but don't lose hope! Try to figure out your topic as soon as possible and see if there are primary sources available. I had to change my topic due to constraints of available sources - try to figure this out as early as possible.","The course assignments are structured in such a way that it makes writing a 25 page paper less stressful. You won't be able to procrastinate, because you get started right away. But I do think the plenary component was not super beneficial, since they tended to be broad discussions that may or may not be relevant to your specific paper. Sections were nice because they facilitated close interaction with other students and your TF. Overall though, it was really cool to write a 25 page paper on a topic of your choice. Huge sense of accomplishment!","You get out what you put into this course.","This course is a great next step in the history of science tutorial sequence. It provides a solid introduction to archival research and secondary source usage. My tutorial head, Anouska, was wonderful and accessible and provided wonderful guidance throughout the process. It is not an easy course and it requires a significant amount of time, but the support structure is there to help you through it.","This is a very challenging course but you will learn a lot about how to conduct independent research in the history of science and take on a large writing assignment.  The deadlines set by the section leaders are incredibly helpful!","Overall, good tutorial - better than the junior tutorials for many other concentrations from what I've heard from friends. Not as amazing as sophomore tutorial, but overall a solid introduction for how to write a long 20-30 page research paper. Makes me feel more prepared for my thesis.","This class teaches you how to really write a research paper. At the beginning it seems overwhelming but it is a very gratifying process especially when you produce your final product.","The guidelines for writing the research paper are useful (though adding in your own mini-deadlines is a must), and the theoretical grounding plenary provides is helpful, especially if you are thinking about writing a thesis. If possible, try to get this class's schedule early so you can build your other commitments around these deadlines; research takes more time than you think.  Really useful training in scholarly history projects!","History of science has been everything that everyone has said it is going to be. I think that this course did exactly what it was supposed to do. Got me thinking and intrigued in something outside of predetermined and preplanned course material from a textbook or lectures and I went searching and I had to stop myself from reading more and more. I learned so much and I enjoyed becoming an expert on something new and stepping outside of my comfort zone. I learned how to research and how to write a research paper. I also learned that I did not want to write a thesis, which was a valuable lesson that I would not have learned any other way!","Awesome class. Try to have some idea of what you want to write about before you come in, but it's okay if you don't. It's a lot of work but it's worth it at the end.","This class is essentially just writing your junior paper (good and bad).","Finalize your topic ASAP. The longer it  takes to do this, the longer you'll have to read your sources for and the longer it will take to get a working draft.","This is the class where you decide whether you want to and would enjoy writing a thesis. Not every student would enjoy writing a thesis, and so not every student will enjoy this class. However, HS 98 was a valuable experience.","Be ready to work hard, and start planning early. The way to not get stressed is to make a plan for yourself and stick to it.","A very helpful tutorial for research and writing techniques in the history of science","Start thinking about your topic early on. Do your research early on. Try not to write this paper in the last two weeks, it won't be a fun experience.","do everything earlier than you think you need to!","It's required! But I enjoyed the class a lot and thought it was quite enjoyable. Plenary sessions were a little broad, though, and didn't seem too directly relevant a lot of the time.","Don't go in with high hopes of improving your writing or being supported.","This is a required class, so take it if you have to. Writing the paper was a more strenuous experience than I expected it to be, but they help you through it pretty well."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Get to research a subject of your choice! Pick something interesting to you and it will be easy"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Junior tutorial has been one of my favorite academic experiences at Harvard! The chance to take an idea you're interested in and run with it has been exciting, empowering, and really really educational. The teaching staff, and in particular, my tf Lisa were endlessly supportive, generating helpful feedback as well as concrete suggestions for areas to improve or expand my paper. It was so exciting to realize an idea, from inception to finished project, and I feel like my understanding of academic papers is much more nuanced and appreciative now! The class really sets you up for success and has gotten me so excited about writing a thesis next year. I also feel like I honed by history of science analytical skills, which is a helpful mark of progress within the concentration.","It's always a challenge to write a good paper, but the support system and structure of this course make it not only bearable but fun. (It's especially nice to have peers who can commiserate\/give you advice.) Archival research is exciting; turning in the final draft has a relieving and satisfying sense of accomplishment. The course teaches fantastic writing and analytical skills, providing you with a solid toolkit to go forth and thesis (if that's your cup of tea) or even just to write better essays in other classes. It may be a required course, but it's one to look forward to.","It's a lot more work and time than you think it will be and you need to have a topic in mind coming in or you will be at a disadvantage almost immediately. It's basically a two\/on and a half semester class in one.","If you are reading this review, it is likely that you have little choice in whether or not to enroll in this course because it is a concentration requirement. Fortunately, the class is well-structured and has a great deal of support available to guide you through what at times can be a tenuous task.  Be sure to conscientiously complete each step of preparation to make the final writing of your Junior Paper less stressful!","pick a topic before the class begins, it is much more time consuming than 97","This class gets to be somewhat annoying. You spend every section talking about each person's progress, and it is really redundant (especially when you could be using the time to write the paper). The research kickstarter is really annoying and this class is definitely not graded on whether or not you completed things. They take points off if your feedback isn't good enough, for example. That being said, the TFs and Dr. B. are truly awesome, and they are the reason why this course was a valuable experience. Lisa is amazing and will make you a much better researcher and writer.","Be prepared to devote a lot of time on your chosen topic.","great if you're thinking about getting into the history of science","If students work hard, they will get a lot out of this class. The more work you put in, the greater the grade, particularly since this assignment is a graded paper.","Start thinking about topics as early as possible, as having an idea is helpful. However, it often changes, so getting on top of it early is a great idea.","This course is a lot of work and takes up A LOT of time. Be prepared to work hard. Stay on top of the deadlines and try your hardest not to procrastinate. It is extremely useful and will teach you great skills for inside and outside classroom use. It's pretty awesome because it allows you to explore anything in history of science, technology, and medicine that your interested in. It's super flexible. After this course, you should have a better idea of if you want to thesis or not.","The research process is challenging at first, but if you start with a figure\/event\/object and identify a relevant archive, you will be able to construct a more coherent narrative about your topic of interest.","The class structure and the way it breaks up the paper into a semester long effort is really great! Keep up with the deadlines, reach out to the teaching staff if needed (they are very supportive and willing to help), and enjoy this opportunity to create your own piece of original research!","-- Really trains you to write excellent papers which is applicable not just in the history of science but in all courses at Harvard","This course provides the opportunity to delve into a topic entirely of your own choosing within the history of science. I really enjoyed researching an event that few people had heard of or written about. The teaching team offers excellent support; so even though the research paper can seem daunting at first, they ensure that everyone finishes with something they are proud of.","It's a very well-led tutorial. You'll learn a lot!","Start early, seek your TF's and Professor's advice and support, think about a topic over the summer"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"7.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"29","response rate":"82.76","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"1120","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"9","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"1120","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 98","course_id":"2637","cat_num":"1120","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
