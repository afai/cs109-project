For me, it was a serious creative outlet and it was great to get credit for it.","The most interesting and engaging course I've taken at Harvard.  I looked forward to lecture and section each week, and feel like I've taken a lot away from it.

If you're interested in expanding your musical boundaries, take this course.","One of the shining stars of the music department.","Hans is a character and a good one- he is incredibly knowledgeable and does crazy things with sound. Final concert is an awesome semester-culminating event"]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Use the time in the studio! Harvard has some really nice equipment and software that is hard to access otherwise.","It was one of the best classes I have ever taken.  It was excellent.  If you are interested in electronic music you would be crazy not to take this course.  The studios are tremendous and you will learn a ton.  I almost always enjoyed working on my assignments.","It's a wonderful class that greatly expanded my musical horizons.","The only caveat is that the class spends most of its time dedicated to examining one very particular sub-field of music. If you don't like this kind of music, the class could become tiresome.","Is nice!","It's kind of a weird class and the stuff I learned I will most likely never use again (i.e. Pro Tools or AudioSculpt), unless I go into music production.  However, it made me think about sound in a different way, and obviously sound is a very integral part of our lives.  Personally, I just really dislike the electroacoustic music and think it's often creepy\/weird\/nonsensical, but it's \"interesting.\""]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This course was immensely rewarding and enjoyable, and opened a realm of new sonic possibilities to me even though I had heard some of this type of work before.","This is an amazing class. Don't necessarily worry about having a strong background in music\/theory (I can't even read music and I got a lot out of the class) just be willing to put in a lot of time in the studio and to keep your ears open.","I would say what I said earlier--Not only did it teach me useful things about software and hardware, but it completely changed the way I listen to music, as well as the world around me.  I've never had this much fun in a course--at the same time, I don't think I've ever learned this much (in so many different areas) in only one semester.","this class, while very fun, takes a lot of time. don't fall behind. you will definitely learn a ton","I would strongly recommend but with an equally strong disclaimer about the workload. If you take your work seriously, this class can easily take up over 20hrs a week.

Not only will you learn very interesting things about electroacoustic music history and composition and the technology used, but you will explore concepts of expression and perception, how to convey ideas, etc.  The class will alter the way you listen to the world.  The creation and performance of your own piece at the HYDRA concert is very rewarding.","This course requires a lot of time in general, and at times can be frustrating because the time you put in is not necessarily reflected in the music you produce. BUT, it is definitely unlike most courses offered at Harvard.  Professor Tutschku is awesome and is a refreshing departure from other Harvard professors."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Take it! You will love it and you will learn something you can find nowhere else at Harvard.","This is a truly great class, providing those who take it with the tools, understanding, and ability required to write music concrete and to work deeply with sound, crafting it, placing it in a space, and juxtaposing different parts of it in a piece through heavy use of pro tools and other software. It definitely requires an open mind, as many people might not consider what we make in this class to be music, but regardless of whether or not it is music, it is an interesting form of art, and as long as you can appreciate it for what it is instead of becoming annoyed at it for what it isn't, you should deeply enjoy and get a lot from this class.","Do as much of your work in advance as possible -- always bring something (even if rough) to class; the feedback one gets is invaluable.","This class will teach you how to analyze music and listen to everything in a given track.  You will listen to music differently.  This class is extremely rewarding.","A great course, really unique and much more engaging\/rigorous\/worthwhile than most other courses at Harvard. An opportunity to immerse yourself in a totally new type of thinking and creating. But be prepared to work hard!","It changed the way I listen and helped me appreciate what's involved in the creative process of art. As many past participants have said, the more time you put in the more you get out of it, but you have to put in a lot of time in anyway. Be ready spend some weekend nights in the studio and ask for extensions on all your final papers. The concert is worth it, though; it was one of the coolest Harvard experience I've had."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This class was very time consuming some weeks, especially during the second half of the semester, but was one of the best classes I have taken, and one of the most rewarding too.","If you're even reading these comments, you should take this class.  You'll spend hours and hours and hours in the studio, but it's incredibly worthwhile.  You learn amazing things about the way sound can be edited, manipulated, treated and mistreated, and it's all hands-on.  The final project is a composition that's played through a massive sound diffusion system--think surround sound, but with up to 32 loudspeakers.","Come with an open mind and you'll gain many new perspectives on sound and music, and how to put them together. Great teaching too.","Very fun and creative class. you learn a lot and are shocked at what you were able to produce","You'll learn how to use Protools, Audiosculpt and other software, and you'll listen to some fascinating pieces that outline the growth of electroacoustic music, but more than that you'll find yourself looking hard at what sound is and what music is in this class. Hans is a truly insightful, experienced, and knowledgeable artist and it's a privilege to be taught by him. The work may get frustrating at times and you need to be prepared to put in a fair amount of time and energy but you will come out of this class feeling like you've gone out on a limb and created a piece of art."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Don't expect it to be anything like tonal music. And it does actually take time outside of class to do recordings and work in the studio. It's cool to develop an entirely different language for music though.","This semester, five people were enrolled in the class, and this intimate setting proved ideal. Even if more people are signed up, I would highly recommend taking this class nonetheless. There is no other course quite like this at Harvard, and it is an experience you should not miss. Electroacoustic music has had a tremendous influence on music in the last 60 years, but few people are familiar with how it is actually produced. This course teaches you how to create electoacoustic works, while also exposing you to the fascinating tradition of electroacoustic art music. If you take this course, you will have the opportunity to create a piece which is played in concert (through 40+ speakers)--something you will likely not be offered again for years. Most importantly, by taking this course you will learn an entirely new mode of listening to, and appreciating, sound.","If you are at all interested in the qualities of sound itself, composition in general, music-oriented technology, or anything else along those lines this course is fantastic. There's a decent probability that you may never do anything else like it again, but the knowledge you will gain can easily be applied to so many other areas of music and technology. Additionally, the course is extraordinarily intimate. It's one of those courses that everyone becomes close over the semester since they are all working together and there are so few of you. Hands down one of, if not, the best courses I have ever taken.","You need to put in a lot of time in the studio each week.  If you can manage the amount of time it takes it an extremely worthwhile class.  It's one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.","It teaches you to listen differently."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a great composition class. Composing a static electronic piece poses interesting challenges: although you can instantly hear what you have while you're composing, it's also more difficult to imagine what the final performance will sound like, especially in this class, where you're composing a stereo piece for live diffusion across 40 speakers in Paine hall.","This class is very rewarding.  It requires much more work than you would think.","This might be one of the most difficult courses I've taken at Harvard, but it was also one of the best.  I learned a lot every single day of the class and both the professor and my classmates challenged my understanding of music.  Besides the fascinating conversations, the classes and projects are a lot of fun (even if electronic music isn't your cup of tea) and Hans is great.","This is a fantastic class with a fantastic teacher. It is certainly a lot of work, but so much more rewarding than the electronics classes many of my composer friends at conservatory have to put up with. Save it until when you'll have enough time for it!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is the best music course I have taken. It will open you up to a new dimension of musicality - form, rhythm, harmony that are much more objective and independent of our preconceived western notions of music. Take this course; you won't regret it.","This class allows one to understand sound and music in a totally new way and thus changes the way one perceives music and the sounds they encounter in their world.  The skills learned in this class allow one to really appreciate and understand what it means to shape a sound.","This was by far the most novel class I've taken. To put it simply, my mind was blown every single class period, because we learned how to manipulate sound via very powerful software. I'd never thought of music as sound, or sound as story, and the final project was a difficult, engaging piece of work I had to grapple with. You're crafting in this course. You're not just learning and spitting something out, but rather you're expected to work REALLY hard and produce something dependent on the amount and quality of time you spend outside of class. You're definitely going to spend at least 7 hours a week outside of this class, whether that be in the studio (using world-class equipment) or recording sounds around campus and manipulating it.","Take this course if you are very interested in sound production techniques. The music you make, however, must have no harmony, rhythm, or melody in the style of other music."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you are interested in experimental music, particularly electronics, you should DEFINITELY take this class.  If you know who Pierre Schaeffer, Xenakis, Terry Riley, Alvin Lucier, etc those sorts of people are, this class will be right up your alley.  You will have access to an AMAZING studio (two actually), you'll get to compose multi-channel music, you'll work with Max\/MSP (which is pretty amazing) - just do this.  If you are reading the description for this course, chances are you are the sort of person who will like it.  Aaron was an awesome professor, but he was only guest teaching it for a year.  If Josiah comes back to TF again, you are in luck, the man is a max\/msp wizard!","This class is mind-blowing. Like. Seriously. Take. It. Please.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few classes here at Harvard that has completely changed my perspective on a particular subject \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0in this case, on listening to and creating music, and appreciating even the most minute sounds commonly ignored on a day to day basis. I never knew that walking around in the world could be such a glorious experience,\u00c2\u00a0especially (but not necessarily) when donning a pair of headphones and walking around with a microphone.\r\n\r\nFor those that already have background with electroacoustic music, depending on the year, this class will teach you additional skills like how to work with MaxMSP to expand your technical skillset. For those that have no background, learning how to use software like ProTools will be helpful if you're want to be involved in any sort of audio engineering in the future.\r\n\r\nThe assignments do take quite a bit of time, but don't let that discourage you in any way. The work is worth every bit of time you put into it, and is quite fun, so the hours pass by enjoyable and quickly!","This class provides access to a wealth of electroacoustic compositional resources.
