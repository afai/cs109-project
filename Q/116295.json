'08":{"comments":["it provides good exposure to the core issues of social choice in a way that is accessible but still very insightful","i wouldn't recommend this course for most students. i would only recommend it if the person was seriously interested in social choice theory, and, even then, i would just recommend that they take 2020b, which spends its last 2 weeks on social choice. there's not much value added in 2006, to be honest, especially for the people interested in applied formal work."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["it is a great class for those who are interested in using formal theory in political science in particular comparative politics","Interesting course and lively professor, but not clear that one really gets a good understanding on Formal Theory tools from it. Very focused on Acemoglu's\/Robinson's \"Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy\" book."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["A very good introduction to the latest in formal modeling and the literature. But be prepared to have to slog through a lot of the material on your own time, as the classes go so quickly that it is hard to follow and the slides are hard to work through on your own.","Great if you are interested in game theory. Tough class though."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["You get out of this course what you put in.","The class is useful as a broad exposure to the kind of modeling done in Political science. It's good if you just want to get a sense of the kind of theories used in political science. It may be less useful if you are just interested in the ideas in a less mathematical manner.","The course had very interesting material. You get to see cool applications of game theory to the realm of political science and the lecture and section material provides interesting problems to consider for future research.","Anyone who wants to learn about leading formal theory research on development and institutions will find the class very useful."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.80","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2006","course_id":"2250","cat_num":"5487","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2006","course_id":"2250","cat_num":"5487","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2006","course_id":"2250","cat_num":"5487","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
