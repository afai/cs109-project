Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be scared; few people in the class had any extensive prior art experience. The readings tended to be light and generally were not so dense as to be impossible to understand. Class discussion tended to focus on readings and visual insights about a handful of artworks. Taking notes helped with the papers a little bit, but not too much. Some readings were more relevant to your essays than others, depending on your topic.\r\nThe essays are difficult to write if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend enough time finding a topic that interests you and has a lot to talk about, because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be focusing on what insights can be gained from an artwork (or two.) If you want to do well, pick artworks that speak to you, and learn to enjoy the material. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of visual interpretation and provides a nice break from strictly lecture-based courses. Also, as with any writing assignments, START EARLY on your essays.","This class is great if you want to explore an interest in artistic analysis or if you are already experienced. It's very enjoyable to learn and Professor De Young is great!","Definitely a good class for Expos. Not too much reading which is nice. Justine is great.","This is a great course and Professor De Young is a great preceptor! Definitely one of the best and most interesting expos classes around.","Hard but makes your writing better","It takes a great interest in history to enjoy it","This class is a fantastic way to fulfill the expository writing requirement. It turned out to be my favorite class this semester because I found that I enjoyed writing about art history so much.","Unless you have an intrinsic interest in art, stay away. It's hard to write essays about art in my opinion."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class was a lot more work than other expos classes, and I'm not sure it was worth it. It was fun, but I felt somewhat abandoned in the research portion of the class.","There is a lot of work but you learn how to critique art effectively. Additionally, like any expos class, it really teaches you how your writing is probably and reasonably wrong and how to improve it. It is the most eye-opening writing class I have taken.","This class is more demanding than other Expos classes. That extra work often takes the shape of busy work that is not helpful in developing as a writer. The class like all Expos is graded against your classmates so if you care about your grade and are not an Art History person don't take this class.","very interesting subject matter, but difficult class","The Body in Art is one of the best Expository Writing experiences. I went into this class without any art or art history background. I was looking for an Expos class where I knew that I would always be learning, and this certainly was that class. Professor De Young is an amazing preceptor who gives very detailed feedback and really helps improve your writing. The readings are very interesting, but they do take up a lot of time. You will be working on Expos every day of your week; however, art history can be a lot of fun and the readings are always interesting. Professor De Young's handouts are also a handy guide for your writing at Harvard and beyond. Take this Expos class if you want to learn something new and exciting, are willing to put in a little bit of time, and actually improve your writing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.90","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"15","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.138","course_id":"1682","cat_num":"51531","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.138","course_id":"1682","cat_num":"51531","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.138","course_id":"1682","cat_num":"51531","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
