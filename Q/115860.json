'08":{"comments":["This course is likely to be helpful to someone who wants to develop a specific research design.  If students are not interested in engaging with the philosophical aspects of social science inquiry, I'd recommend a different course, since the first half of this one focuses quite heavily on those issues.","The assignments and feedback you get will be very helpful. In addition, you will find the last few weeks of class very informative. The first few weeks of discussion, however, will be somewhat less useful.","If the syllabus was reoriented around counterfactual analysis, I would recommend it.","If you have an idea for a research project you really want to develop, and want detailed feedback from a top-rate political scientist, this class would be great for you."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Take this course if you need a broader understanding of the discipline, and could use some extra skills in preparing a prospectus or research grant proposals.","This is a very valuable class for any graduate student in the social sciences; in fact, I wish I had taken it earlier.","this helped me figure out what type of research i wanted to do (the type of question i am interested in), but don't expect it to be a \"practical\" course.","Excellent course and Professor Hall is a great teacher. You will learn a lot from discussions in class with peers, and you will receive extensive feedback from Prof. Hall on every assignment and draft of your paper. The only class I have taken where you are walked through the proposal writing process from theory development to case selection.","I would tell students that this is a fabulous class and is particularly well suited for students who want to step back and think about the different questions that social scientists can ask and how to approach different types of questions.  This is not a great class for someone who wants concrete answers to methodological questions, though it does give a sense of how to design research."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is one of, if not the best, course I've taken in pursuit of my PhD.","really helpful if you plan to become a political scientist","Incredibly helpful course for (a) developing a potential research project and (b) thinking critically about research design in political science. The course provides an analysis of political science\/social science methods that the standard quantitative sequence misses.","I think 2009 should be a required course for every grad student in the department - it complements 2000\/2001 in very important ways.","This is THE class to take if you are interested in Social Science research - should be mandatory for all social scientists."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is an excellent course for anyone interested in doing research in the social sciences. It covers incredibly helpful specific methodological issues b\u00c4\u00b1ut also more general and fundamental questions about doing research and developing a dissertation idea. Prof Hall is a wonderful person and a great discussion leader. The assignment was also very helpful.","This is an essential course for graduate students in the Department of Government. The material covered in the course is foundational to the discipline and hugely stimulating. Professor Hall's guidance is exceptional."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["A course like this should be required for all students in government. What I found most helpful is that it helps the student to reflect critically about various commonly used and alternative methods.","Political scientists spend a great deal of time discussing methods, but not as much time on research design, a somewhat higher level of abstraction. This course is a very nice corrective to that neglect."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2009","course_id":"2252","cat_num":"1080","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2009","course_id":"2252","cat_num":"1080","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2009","course_id":"2252","cat_num":"1080","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
