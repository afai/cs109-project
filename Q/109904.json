Nope. This class has everything a class can have--weekly responses, midterm, three papers, final exam, field trips. Lectures were definitely interesting, reading Paradise Lost was definitely something I enjoyed and would not have had a chance to do outside the class, but the amount of work was just too much. It was also a little intimidating because I was the only science concentrator in my section, which meant I had to put up with a lot of people talking about art history, religion, iambic pentameter, and whatnot. The final exam was also just ridiculous--they made us memorize dates\/creators of images, identify quotes from the many, many, many readings that we had, etc. Wouldn't recommend it to people who are not up to doing a lot of reading every week.","This is a fantastic course, both for students pursuing a concentration in HAA, Literature, English, or a related field, and for those mildly interested in art and literature and need to fulfill their Ethical Reasoning requirement. Its TFs are personable and lead excellent sections, the readings are (admittedly, sometimes a lot, but) well-chosen, and the lectures are amazing, and even though the professors are famous, they're totally willing to talk to you outside of class.","This class is very disorganized and the combination of art history\/english did not work well together. The grading was very harsh considering how haphazard and hard to follow the lectures were. The reading was long and dense and never reviewed, although it was ALL tested on the final. I would not recommend this class.","There is a lot of reading, a lot.","It is a wonderful class regardless of your religion and I highly recommend it.","This was an interesting course. I liked the art history combination with english. However, the amount of reading is absurd. It's completely unnecessary and you can get by without doing most of it. If you do all the readings, it is an extremely difficult workload but if you don't, you can still do well in the class and you will enjoy it more. Also, the section response posts are irritating. Hopefully they get rid of those for the future. I'd recommend it though, it's a chill way to get ER out of the way if you don't like philosophy.","It's an interesting way to fulfill ER, though the ER component is a little forced. The relationships between the texts and the HAA component are also forced at times, so it will seem a bit haphazard. A lot of memorization is required. All in all you learn a lot though, especially if you haven't had a religious background.","It's a lot of reading, but it is a great way to get an Ethical Reasoning done while focusing in on something really interesting.","This is the best way to fulfill your Ethical Reasoning requirement! The lectures are amazing, the readings are all interesting, and the sections employ a variety of different way through which to interact with the material such that you won't get bored. Just do yourself a favor and take this class; you won't regret it!","For humanities students who, like me, have been dreading fulfilling the Ethical Reasoning requirement, this course is a wonderful way to engage with philosophical concepts through art and literature. Similarly, I can imagine that the course would be a nice way to get thinking about art for students primarily interested in literature or vice versa. For students with no background in art or literature, it seems like it might be grueling, as the lectures were often quite fast-paced. I loved the art history lectures\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut then art is my area of interest. Greenblatt's lectures were often uninteresting, for me, and I didn't love the literary texts on the syllabus. However, overall I found the course to be a pretty engaging way in to ER. That said, were it not for the Gen Ed component of this course, I likely would have opted for a course taught purely by Koerner\u00e2\u20ac\u201da truly brilliant teacher and art historian who I can imagine would be even more wonderful solo.","This class focuses on interesting material.  The art history lectures were incredibly interesting and I enjoyed learning about paradise lost.  However, I often found the connection between the two disciplines to be tenuous, and the reading was dense.  The papers were interesting and not exceedingly difficult and the final was very fair if you had kept up with the course.","This is an interesting course with a very defined subject matter, but it isn't a super easy gen ed. It is much easier if you have a background with writing papers and actually attend the lectures. Not an easy-A gen ed.","It is a great blend of English and Art History!!","After every lecture we applauded as it would have been disrespectful not to do so. It is as if every lecture has a guest expert speaker come in. Professor Greenblatt and Koerner are brilliant and excellent lecturers. It was a pleasure going to class.","only take this class if it becomes more organized","Should be a much better class once first-year kinks and logistical issues are worked out.","This class is so interesting in its content, but disorganized. If there is a new head TF next year, perhaps the course will be better organized. Otherwise, you should totally take this course!","The class is very art historical and very much in the style of an English department class.  Be prepared for he sort of work that entails.","Brutal class.  I am sad.","Harder than your average Gen Ed, but very interesting","Be prepared to do a LOT of reading.","This class has a lot of potential but in its first year it was a mess. Lectures, readings, and sections were not cohesive or supplementary. There was no narrative to the course. Lectures did not always connect. Most readings had little or nothing to do with what was being taught for the week. For this course to be worth recommending it needs to be considerably re-organized. The material is interesting but the way it is presented takes away from that completely.","Koerner is amazing, Greenblatt's lectures are dry and difficult","This course is a nice option for those looking to fulfill the ethical reasoning requirement or who want to read Paradise Lost in great depth. Although the overall goals of the course, and the cohesion of literature and art history within it were sometimes unclear, there is not too much reading and both professors are engaging lecturers.","Don't take classes the first year they are offered","This is an excellent and interdisciplinary Ethical Reasoning course for students who are interested in literature and art history and may not have much experience with philosophy.  Also, it is worth taking this course simply to see Professor Greenblatt narrate plays in Old English.  The work load primarily consists of three papers (four if you count the midterm in-class essay) with prompts broad enough that they will allow you to explore the moral questions from lectures and readings that most intrigue you.  The teaching staff is very supportive, and field trips to the Museum of Fine Arts to view some of the works we discuss are a fun bonus.","This was one of my favourite classes at Harvard. If you are interested and motivated you can ace this class and get so much out of it. you will read Milton's Paradise Lost with Professor Greenblatt, which is a real treat, and Professor Koerner will introduce you to Durer, Bosch, Hans Holbien, Lucas Cranach and so forth. Any educated person should take this class!","I would recommend this as one of the better options for the ethical reasoning requirement, especially if you are looking for something that is different than Justice. The combination of art and English components of the course under the umbrella of Adam and Eve\/ethical reasoning was interesting, and I was glad to finally read Paradise Lost. Be aware the secondary readings are tested on the final exam, which means you will need to keep up with the somewhat dense reading list to do well.","A great chance to sit hear two brilliant professors say brilliant things for two hours a week. Combined focus on art and literature kept anything from getting stale. The course was a bit unfocused at first but hit its stride when we finally started reading Paradise Lost. It seemed like the lack of focus at the beginning was due to the newness of the course, and I would imagine they'll have it figured out by the next time around!","This course is not a simple course by any means. If you're looking for an easy Ethical Reasoning course, it may be wise to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a moderately-difficult Ethical Reasoning course, one that is engaging and actually interests you, take this class. Both professors are very brilliant, and the readings are dense yet rewarding - I find that I can actually understand them and synthesize the material. Section, for me, has been a lovely experience, the typical college seminar where you question your beliefs and grapple with life's biggest questions. Also, if you know nothing about the Bible as I did, take this class. It will help you understand organized religion a little bit better.","This class was interesting, and a great way to fulfill ER, but it's not interesting. I didn't feel the need to do all the readings and the lectures felt more geared towards the auditors than towards the students.","You don't need to do the reading, but be prepared for an objective exam, even though the course focused on subjective interpretation!","This class was harder than I thought it would be, and even though my grade won't be great, it was a rewarding experience.","I'm only a freshman, but this is the worst class I have ever taken (at the college, or in my previous 12 years of schooling). It was extremely unorganized, the lectures were usually painstaking to sit through (besides the art lectures, those were sometimes intriguing when it was actually organized around a certain artist\/painting and not all over the place).  The sections are completely random (as in no section does the same thing..there's no baseline, its just kind of like TF's just do whatever they want).  You are never told what is really expected of you (what readings - which there are an unreal amount of - are necessary, what details\/information should be known, etc.).  The essays are actually very interesting\/engaging prompts, and seeing as they are the main assignments, they course material\/assignments are fine. Thats the sad part. The course is full of a ton of really really interesting material and subject matter (thats why I never dropped it..I was hoping it would turn around for the better..but it didn't).  It has a ton of potential. I wish I would have taken it in a few semesters when the professors actually have a grasp on what they want the course to be. I would tell you to take the class for those reasons, but unless the professors really revamp the entire course\/organize it well, its not worth it at ALL.  Really unfortunate that I had to waste an entire semester on this class, especially because it actually is very engaging material. Just presented terribly. I sincerely hope the professors reorganize the course and others get the chance to take what COULD BE one of their favorite classes. For shame, is all I'll say, for shame.","The readings can be a little much, sometimes, but lectures are great and Paradise Lost is a lot of fun. The art analysis was my favorite part of the class. Not much work, except during essay weeks.","There are a lot of readings, but wonderful professors that give really interesting lectures.","The readings will help with the essays, and the images in lecture will help you to prepare for the exam.","This class is really a great experience and the teaching staff is fantastic. I would point out that it felt, at times, like an English class about Paradise Lost more than a gen-ed class about Adam and Eve.","Art and art history with deep implications for the trajectory of western philosophy and morality.","Amazing opportunity to take a class with two of the best professors at Harvard. Great lectures, I loved both the art history side and the literature side of things. And the best possible way to satisfy an ethical reasoning- maybe not as much ethical reasoning as there is questioning of historical religious texts and how to interpret them, but still really interesting exploration of this topic.","Take this course if you like the duality of art and literature.  Great professors, and received great feedback on papers.  Interesting topic and loved the field trips to the MFA.","Overall a painless way to fulfill the Ethical Reasoning requirement. The material itself is very interesting and meeting Professor Greenblatt and Koerner and having a conversation with them was a blast! The course may seem like too much work given that it has a midterm, 3 papers, and a final exam; however, the papers are all short (900, 900, 1200 words, respectively) and none of them require research. They are all your own analyses and the TFs are more than happy to guide you on the assignment if you have never written about a painting. That being said, this course very much feels more like an art history course than an ethical reasoning course. The midterm is an in class essay and you are provided with a sample midterm the day before. If you prepare for the sample essay, you'll be more than prepared for the midterm. That being said, although you can get away with not doing the readings and still do well on the midterm and essays, the final exam has quotes you must identify from the readings (title, author, significance) and image identifications (title, artist, date, significance). So, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO LECTURES IF YOU WANT TO DO WELL ON THE FINAL and TAKE GOOD NOTES.","I think it'll be better next year after they restructure it, at times this year it was awkward transitioning between two lectures.  A interesting Gen-Ed about images depicting Adam and Eve, good way to fill an A&I or ER.","It was more work than I anticipated, but I thought the material was interesting!","Take this class if you're a history\/epic poetry\/art geek. It's very good, but you need to enjoy reading Paradise Lost and looking at lots of paintings of Adam and Eve. Go to lecture, as that's the best part (besides the great field trips). Supplementary readings (those other than Paradise Lost\/Gilgamesh) aren't really necessary (until the final), so don't bother if you don't have time.","Very interesting class. Helped me get a good grasp of representations of creation and Adam and Eve, most of the class has an emphasis on Paradise Lost and Northern Renaissance art.","The various components of this class are interesting, but it lacks cohesion and a common set of themes\/works.","Perhaps this should be obvious, but be prepared for a lot of nudity and discussions about sexual topics.  Also, the readings are quite important for the final exam.","Greenblatt and Koerner are absolutely passionate and knowledgeable about the material covered in the course, which ranges from Paradise Lost to the Epic of Gilgamesh to Hieronymus Bosch to Hans Baldung Grien. Their enthusiasm sometimes outstrips the abilities of the class, though, and this gen ed often requires hundreds of pages of reading, plus critical evaluation of paintings covered in lecture, per week. If you have the time and interest to cover the story of the origins of man and this story's interaction with Western history, it really is a fascinating topic, but as a casual class participant, I often felt lost and overwhelmed by the volume of required readings, and often scrambled to prepare for exams and write essays."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"102","response rate":"70.59","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ETH-REASON 37","course_id":"10969","cat_num":"81501","1s":"3","2s":"7","3s":"22","4s":"26","5s":"13"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ETH-REASON 37","course_id":"10969","cat_num":"81501","1s":"0","2s":"15","3s":"44","4s":"11","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ETH-REASON 37","course_id":"10969","cat_num":"81501","1s":"15","2s":"44","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
