Prof. Sadler points you in the direction of further resources and demonstrates effective teaching styles rather than just telling you about them.","Unlike the teaching workshops\/help offered by the Bok Center or through some academic departments, this course focuses less on nuts-and-bolts practical classroom suggestions and more on the broader questions of choosing what is worth teaching and understanding how students learn.  The practical workshops are certainly valuable, but if you are deeply interested in teaching and learning the \"bigger-picture\" approach of this course is an equally valuable one."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class will encourage you to reflect on your teaching experiences, engage in new ways of thinking, and will make you eager for your next teaching opportunity to try it all out!","This class is great if you have any interest in teaching in the future or if you just want to understand how people learn science.","Takes a lot of time but is definitely worth it.","It's more work than you might think a weekly class might be, but it's very useful work. All the assignments give you a chance to reflect on your teaching or find resources for future endeavors."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class is an essential complement to scientific training for aspiring college professors or those who are considering K-12 education."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is a truly wonderful course.  I have had success teaching in the past, but this course has helped me to develop my teaching further.  I had never truly considered education literature or research prior to taking this class. Now, I have many ideas and new techniques to try out in my future teaching experiences!","This is a great way to prepare for being a teaching fellow.","You learn a lot in this course, and it is incredibly helpful for anyone planning to teach at the college level or below. I recommend it, even though things seemed disorganized at times.","Spectacular. If you ever want to teach science, everything is applicable and it will make you think deeply about your style and what you can do to improve yourself as an educator. Could honestly suggest it as a requirement for any and all future science teachers.","I found that this course used a lot more of my time than I initially expected. This was largely due to unfocused assignments which led me to wander around and burn a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what the professor was asking. There were enough positive assignments that made the experience worthwhile, however."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Wonderful class for anyone interested in teaching or education in general. As a small class, it's very tailored to your own interests. Prof. Sadler is the best in the field!
