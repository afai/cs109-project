It's rare to find an instructor at Harvard who shows genuine care about students' learning experience.   Graduate students should strive to know him.  His knowledge is vast.

It's incredibly difficult but really rewarding when you make progress. Himmet Hoca is really helpful and does absolutely everything that he can do to ensure that everyone is learning."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.75","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TURKISH 140b","course_id":"3895","cat_num":"8298","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"TURKISH 140b","course_id":"3895","cat_num":"8298","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"TURKISH 140b","course_id":"3895","cat_num":"8298","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
