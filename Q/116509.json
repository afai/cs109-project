The laboratories are most useful for students who are already familiar with the transmission electron microscope.","This is an excellent course but you need to have a sound background in physics with some knowledge in biological science.","This is a great class if you are needing to learn about the TEM, but they will not teach you optics or any physics presented in lecture.  You are expected to allready know it.","The reservations I have regarding this course: not well organized this year, the lab was a bit more advanced than the lecture--a lot of materials science involved.","Avoid this course like the plague, or if you must take it, skip lecture and be sure to get the lab section later in the week (when they know what they're doing and have the bugs worked out).","This course would be recommended if the teaching fellow is responsive and the instructor is more engaged.
