It's too much work at times, but overall it's worth it.","The course is incredibly rigorous and satisfying, though very difficult. I would recommend this course to students who like to do lots of work and who have a good attention span during lectures. (I would recommend the course more if the textbook is changed.)","You simply must learn about number fields.","There are some really fun topics here.","I would warn future students of this course that if they take it they must be willing to devote nearly all of their time and energy to the course just to keep their heads above water."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["If you like to do algebra and want to see what number theory is like, definitely take this class.","Definitely take this course!  The material is very interesting and the homework assignments are a lot of fun (you may even learn a little bit about Saxons ;]).  Kisin is also an excellent professor, and you would want to have him teach again next year.  While admittedly not the best lecturer (though he is definitely not a bad lecturer), he is very conversational and friendly, and cares a lot for his students' learning always encouraging us to ask him questions.  Also, do not listen to anyone who tells you Math 129 is the hardest undergraduate math course.  Number theory requires often a little more creativity than topology or algebra, since it amalgamates these subjects and applies them to the study of, well, numbers.  It is much more fun than difficult :)"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["I really enjoyed the material in this class; if you like number theory and\/or had a good experience in Math 123, this is a good class for you.\r\n\r\nI think this class was a lot easier this year than in previous years, so difficulty shouldn't be a reason for not taking this course.","number fields are pretty dope. no, seriously, the material in lecture is pretty awesome, even though (at least this year) the problem sets weren't really challenging... Kisin is a nice guy","Material is interesting and HW\/exams not too difficult. Very fun class.","If you like number theory and want to solidify your knowledge of ideals and number fields and the like, this is a good course. The psets aren't hard (at least this year) but lectures will challenge your mind for sure.","This year, the class was a nice and leisurely introduction to algebraic number theory (though I hear it was much easier this year for some reason...might change?).  Prof Kisin is very clear and encourages questions so it's pretty easy to pick up on all the stuff that happens in class.","This course covers very interesting material in an accessible way.","This class is one of the hardest undergrad math classes. Kisin tries to make it easy with short homework and exams that are designed to be easy, but algebraic number theory is very complicated and a lot of the proofs are very involved and rarely intuitive. Many of the people who take it are really smart, so it can be discouraging. Still, things like calculating class groups and figuring out the ramification of prime ideals are definitely interesting, and if you want to see either more number theory or more algebra than 123\/124 this is a good class to take."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["As you can probably tell from the low enrollment but high Q scores, this course is a bit off the beaten path. It's certainly not the most important thing to take as a math concentrator. However, if you're looking for a math course that doesn't need to fulfill requirements, this is a good choice. It's fun, interesting, and not much work outside of understanding what happens in class. Kisin is a good lecturer and often presents multiple proofs of the same thing to illustrate a point.","Take good notes from the class and ask questions! Don't fall behind!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 129","course_id":"2862","cat_num":"2345","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 129","course_id":"2862","cat_num":"2345","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 129","course_id":"2862","cat_num":"2345","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
