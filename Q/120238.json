Radhika is a great lecturer when she does \"lecture,\" and the discussions are valuable especially due to the varied backgrounds of the students (robotics, theory, AI, etc.). One of the more accessible grad classes I've taken as an undergrad mainly because the material is so diverse, which means that nearly everyone is an expert in some aspects but knows very little about others -- picking up stuff as you go along is expected. Still, you probably want some breadth in CS beforehand if you want to get a lot out of the course, especially touching on either AI or hardware\/robotics.","You get to learn a lot about the very broad field of biologically inspired computing. There are quite a bit of readings, but it's worth getting to hear about all of these cool stuff. Plus the final projects that everyone does are really cool to hear about.","This is a seminar class. It mostly involves reading papers (1-2 per class), writing reviews, and discussing in class, plus a final research project at the end. You learn a lot about a variety of topics - swarm behaviors such as foraging and flocking, self-assembly, evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms, to name a few. You don't necessarily need a strong background in computer science although it is helpful of course. Radhika is really good at going through the concepts and explaining the papers, so at the very least, you should be able to get a high level understanding.","Radhika is a great teacher. Some of the topics were very interesting (subjective of course).","Be prepared to thoroughly read the papers to get the most out of the class. Ideally class size will be a bit smaller when you take it than right now though.","If you like any of the related subjects, take this class. The research you'll learn about is very interesting, and you get the opportunity to do a cool final project.","Great introduction to biologically-inspired multi-agent systems. Prof. Nagpal is awesome; great teacher\/facilitator. Heavily paper- and discussion-based\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreading (which can be fairly heavy some weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u201d20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50 pages of papers) is a must. Assignments (paper reviews) every class are a bit of a chore, but are necessary and not that much work.","Amazing course content; fabulous professor; high-impact final projects"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"23","response rate":"78.26","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 289","course_id":"1274","cat_num":"0766","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 289","course_id":"1274","cat_num":"0766","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 289","course_id":"1274","cat_num":"0766","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
