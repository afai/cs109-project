Be prepared to put a good bit of time in to the course. That being said, it is immensely rewarding.","If you've taken Chinese 120a, there's no sense in not taking Chinese 120b. Chinese 120b is a really really excellent class that builds off of Chinese 120a to give you an even stronger base of Chinese vocabulary and grammar and to make you more used to speaking Chinese. If you at all liked Chinese 120a, you'll at least like, if not love, Chinese 120b. You already know how amazing the teaching staff is - Wang laoshi is probably about the nicest, sweetest, most passionate professor you'll find at Harvard. She is an extremely effective lecture and teacher of Chinese and really has a way of making sense of an alphabet-less language for us. Dong laoshi and Zhao laoshi are also so kind and enthusiastic, and they make section fun and interesting, in addition to productive and useful. I'm so happy I continued on with the full year of 120, and this class and its teachers have inspired me to continue.
