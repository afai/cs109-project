'08":{"comments":["It is a great course to get you started with computational finance. It also helps you learn lots about finance if you don't already, in a fun and interesting way. Perhaps one of the best classes I've ever taken.","It's a little scatter-brained and you won't end up learning that much because the topics taught will go over your head.","Its a good class to take, especially if you are interested in how finance actually works.","The course will be a lot of work, but it will let you explore surprising ways to connect computer science and finance.","This course is very flexible in times of amount of effort you want to put in. It can be very time consuming if you want to finish a good project and you can also wait until other people help you to do it because it's always group projects.","great class if you are interested in finance and computer science"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This class covers a wide range of interesting topics.","The material is not easy and the papers take deceptively long to wrestle with, but the other students in the class are great and the discussions help a lot.","How to design the rules of a game where noone can cheat? What if this game was a multi-billion dollar auction? If this can not be solved, how effectively can we approximate the solution? If you find yourselves intrigued by these or similar questions, you should definitively take this course. Last but not least, Prof. Parkes is a great instructor and his class is equally a great experience.","This class is a good introduction to graduate research in the economics and computer science area.  It is a good chance for advanced undergraduates to get a feel for graduate study in computer science.","A terrific course if you're interested in the material. The workload is what you make of it: there are a couple problem sets, you have to read one or two papers before every class and post comments, present a paper to the class, and write a final paper. If you read every paper really carefully, it's a lot, but you can take a lot out of this class without doing that. You really get a great view of the field of Econ & CS research as it stands today.","If you are interested in discovering new topics in CS and Economics, then take this course!","Amazing class. Excellent professor and brilliant students.","Really interesting survey of important topics.","A background or strong interest in Economics is crucial to be successful in this class.","Those looking to get into or starting in the field of mechanism design or computer science and economics should take this course."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Varies from year to year, but generally a very theory-oriented class.","This was by far the most fulfilling course I took this semester --- Professor Chen is amazing, as were my classmates and Alice.  Really cool material and awesome people to discuss it with = a great class","you will see a bit more how academic research works. Really interesting discussions and a light courseload except for sometimes long readings. Yiling is awesome!","A good way to try your hand at research and to be exposed to some new ideas. The most useful part of the course is the research paper at the end. But for that reason, it can also be the most idiosyncratic.","It's a great course for getting started on research ideas, and as an economics student you'll get a valuable look at some active research areas in computer science. However, note that the \"auxiliary\" tasks, e.g. solving problem sets and reading papers that aren't that relevant for your work, take up more time than you would expect.","This course is very narrow and theoretical. You will not learn very much that is applicable outside of the EconCS group. That said, the EconCS group does interesting things. But more than a passing interest is required to enjoy this course."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is a great seminar-style course. Yiling is an awesome professor, and the topics covered are just really, really cool. The course is not too work-intensive (though it can get tough if a p-set is due or if you're up for presenting a paper), yet I came out of it feeling like a learned quite a bit.","Great opportunity to learn some basic game theory and explore how social choice problems can be effectively addressed from the perspective of a computer scientist.","reading EconCS papers."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["You will discover some really interesting topics.","Great grad course to take as an undergrad, and really gives you the opportunity to engage in your own research project. If you're an undergrad, do pay attention to the prereqs. I didn't feel that an AI background was necessary at least for this year, but lacking a strong economics background made the beginning of the course more challenging. But if you're willing to do a dense crash course on game theory, etc. in the first couple weeks, it's fine. Really the most important prereq is mathematical maturity and some background in algorithms to get the most out of the papers. You can get by without much of any background in anything, but honestly you wouldn't learn much.","This class was a lot of fun because the students are the ones doing the presentations and presenting the papers. The topics covered were truly interesting, and the open ended final project really allows you to deep dive into a topic that interests you.","As an undergraduate AM\/Econ concentrator, I found this course fantastic. The work consists mostly of reading papers published within the last few years, so you are really at the forefront of research in the area. It was a great low-stress way to learn about new stuff.","Course covers pretty interesting material; at some points I lost some motivation in the theory, but at other points I really appreciated the theory. Lectures are given by students and usually add to understanding.","Cool class covering lots of interesting material. Also, Yiling is awesome. Have fun with the presentations and final research projects.","If you are interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Economics, you should definitely take this class. Just recognize that it is more of an Economics class than a Computer Science class.","It was a good overview, but make sure you know game theory.","Really great class! Yiling is the best; she is so sweet and cares so much about her students. While the readings might seem hard at first, you end up learning a lot from the presentations and discussions. The problem sets are really helpful to make sure you're understanding the material, but I think I learned the most from the final project.","If you are interested in the subject matter, this is an excellent course -- you'll learn a lot, survey the area, and get some research experience in whatever you choose."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you are interested in the (admittedly narrow) area of research that is the focus of this class you should definitely take it. Just be aware that it is highly theoretical. The workload is definitely manageable.","It's a chill class, depending on who teaches it. This year, the class wasn't too structured, and we ended up reading several papers and going over some of the basics in combinatorial optimization.","Great class. Take it.","Your class experience will depend entirely on the instructor, who changes frequently. Nicole was a fun, clear teacher, and it was great to learn from someone who is very active in research in the field. It was fine to take with a light formal math background, Stat 110, and Econ 1052 (game theory). I am mainly an econ person and have no CS background, but having CS friends in the class might have helped."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 286r","course_id":"1281","cat_num":"1099","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 286r","course_id":"1281","cat_num":"1099","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 286r","course_id":"1281","cat_num":"1099","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
