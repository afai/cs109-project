'10":{"comments":["TAKE IT. The community service component of this course will change you - making you more comfortable speaking the language, of course... but also it will allow you to see a side of Boston that you might have otherwise overlooked. If you speak Spanish and are passionate about making a positive change in your community, this is the perfect class. If I could take it again, I would.","The class requires a big time commitment (time spent in the classroom, doing service, and doing homework), but it's completely worth it.  I learned so much about Spanish, and my fluency increased dramatically, especially as a result of the service component of the class.  I got a sense of the Latino experience in Boston, and I was able to improve my knowledge while doing a type of service that I enjoy.  A unique class that will get you out of the Harvard people and help your personal development as much as your academic improvement.  Amazing.","great class; carmen is fantastic; the volunteering obligation can be a big time commitment, but if you really like the organization you're working with it's really enjoyable (i probably would have done similar volunteering anyway, so it was nice to get class credit for it and get some extra spanish experience)","This subject matter is important, and the course is a rare opportunity to combine course work with community action.  I would have liked to see more analysis of issues of social justice surrounding latinos in the U.S., immigration policy, and causes and conditions of immigration to the U.S. (including U.S. foreign policy and economic policy, colonialism and neocolonialism, etc.)","This course provides the unique opportunity to put into practice the Spanish language skills students have learned in the classroom setting and engage with the Latino community in Boston through fun and meaningful volunteer work.","A fantastic course! Section is wonderful, the readings are interesting but not too long (a rarity at Harvard), and the opportunity to volunteer in the Latino community in Boston is really a cool chance to learn outside the classroom. I improved my written and oral Spanish, learned a lot about Latino history and issues in the US, and learned about the Latino community in Boston!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Great class. It feels so good to be out helping in the community as your assignment!  Way better than doing problem sets or essays or pre-labs.  The work is meaningful and people driven, and you see the direct application of what you are learning in class.  Also, very relevant to us today with a large and growing Latino community in the US.","The volunteering component of this course is amazing.  The discussions are generally great, but sometimes a little unfocused and lacking in reading materials.","Definitely the best Spanish class I've taken at Harvard. This is the closest you can get to immersion without leaving the US, and I learned a ton about the Latino community in Boston.","Take this course to learn the real, non-classroom Spanish that you don't get in other courses. The survey of the Latino experience is good, but it does not go completely in-depth. The five required essays are manageable, but you should stRt early to allow time to edit. The volunteer experiences are variable. If you do not speak more Spanish than English in the first week, it is already time to have a delicate conversation with your host site or TF. You should always be thinking about the social and historical context of what you read in order to get the most out of the class. Overall, this class was very worthwhile. You would best take it without too much of a break after your last Spanish experience.","I really enjoyed this class although i did not have the best experience with my organizations. Most people did have good experiences though so do not let that keep you from taking the class. ALL of the readings are interesting and not that long. There are also great movies in the course and the conversation during class is extremely interesting. It is also extremely easy to receive a great participation grade because you are constantly being prompted to talk. This was the only Spanish class that I believed would interest me and I was completely right about it being great.","This is a wonderful course. The instructors are terrific and the internship component is a real challenge for your language skills.","Great course. Pick service wisely.","Spanish 59's content is thin to the point of evaporation.  Readings are short but irrelevant. Discussions are long but go nowhere.  Service is only tangentially tied into the course through three tedious \"Diario\" exercises. If studying the Latino community in depth is your goal, RUN, don't look, elsewhere. Quite possibly the worst course of my Harvard career.","This class is a lot of work but it is so worth it. I enjoyed my community service, and I think that if you are looking for a challenging but unique way to better your spanish this is it. Also, Prof. Parra is wonderful.","It is not an easy course and it is time consuming, but my outside service work was incredibly rewarding, albeit difficult.","Great way to practice Spanish and help the local community at the same time.","Too much emphasis on Mexico instead of a broad analysis of latino culture, translated readings which distort the overall purpose of the readings\/selection, lack of reflection of the community service one does outside class","Good course. Really good chance to be involved in the community and use your spanish. Not very difficult, but requires time and energy. I'd definitely recommend it -- Carmen and Maria are wonderful."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Great course! Humberto was a great TF who is really passionate about the topic and just an amazing teacher overall with a great sense of humor. The material covered in the class is very relevant and engaging. It teethes you a lot about issues surrounding immigration that you wouldn't necessarily be able to know jus form reading the news. The course is good for those interested in social sciences in general as well as immigration.","It is an amazing class, but you need to be willing to volunteer 4 hours per week","This class was wonderful! The discussions we had really opened my mind to a different culture, and the work we did always felt as though it had a purpose. I loved working in the Latino community, and the service portion of the class really helps to make the course unique.","Awesome class. Loved the material (the movies were so-so though) and Humberto was fantastic. Take the course is you love foreign languages!","Great class for people looking to improve or maintain oral skills. Class is very discussion based. Make sure to choose an organization that you really enjoy or else the outside work will not be useful for you.","Make sure that you're interested in committing yourself to 4-5 hours of volunteer work per week. Don't be intimidated by the syllabus...the workload is VERY manageable. Reason to take this class: Humberto is one of the best TFs you'll have, ever. Everyone loves him. He's actually amazing. Take the course!","Taking this class really inspired me to get back into community service and made me feel much more involved at Harvard. Furthermore, Humberto is an incredibly eloquent, witty, and profoundly humane TF. He really caused me to reevaluate everything I understood about Latino Culture, and shed new light on topics that I previously hadn't considered. He made sure that everyone had an opportunity to speak and was receptive to questions. I really feel he has a mastery of these topics, yet he remained extremely neutral throughout our discussions. I always looked forward to going to spanish class, and would definitely recommend this course to anyone considering it.","This class is incredible and a must at Harvard!!","This is certainly a very unique course, and the intimate setting of the class is great for facilitating in-depth discussion on Latino culture and identity. However, the time and effort that I put into the readings\/movies was not always worth the amount of analysis that we had in class."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["In this class you will learn about critical issues facing Spanish speaking communities in the United States, as well as issues affecting the United States as a whole. You will also gain first hand experience what it is like to combat these issues, as well as having the chance to engage with the Spanish language in a new and challenging way.","This class was very disorganized - Harvard doesn't have control over the organizations' needs so that part is disjointed.  Our course website was down the entire time - Eugenio had to email us all the assignments.  Some of the readings are in English, but they are very culturally interesting.  You learn a lot about the culture - a very eye-opening course that overlaps with courses in other departments like sociology.","I loved the service portion of this class! great way to practice speaking. not too much busy work.","This class is one of the best classes I have ever taken, and definitely the best Spanish class I have ever been in. I would recommend this class without a doubt! Take this class!","This class is the only spanish class of its kind. It was definitely the most interesting spanish class I have taken at harvard. Don't miss out!","This is a great class to take if you want extensive practice with spanish language in a setting other than a classroom. I loved my work in the community and truly looked forward to being there each week. Sometimes the lectures are a little slow, but Eugenio is very caring and really wants you to get the most out of the class. This class requires little time to prepare for the lectures, but is time intensive due to the community service hours (and transportation to and from there) required each week. That said, I highly recommend the course as long as you truly want to practice spanish in a class that is likely very different from what you have previously taken."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course would seem to cover the same themes that a high school Spanish language course would cover, similarly exploring the general themes of Latino identity and culture. For this reason I almost didn't take the course, because such an attempt, in high school, had always had to unsatisfyingly superficial cultural discussion. But I'm very very glad I took this course after all. Unlike high school courses on similar topics, this course works. With remarkable authenticity it presents the Latino experience between the worlds of the US and Spanish speaking nations in all its cultural nuance. In this way it illustrates the powerful effect of Ethnography and ethnic studies, functioning as a very effective introduction to the discipline.","This is a really great class if you are looking to apply your spanish outside of the classroom. The volunteer component is really great. The assignments are also pretty easy and there are no exams or difficult papers. However, be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class (many hours a week when you include the class time and the volunteer work).","This is the best Spanish class in the department and a must take.  The community service is a lot of fun and I had a wonderful time at my organization and there is nothing like working in Spanish for four hours every week.  The academic parts of the course are not too bad and are very focused on conversation - not a lot of reading.  Try and get into Maria's section as she is fantastic. I am extremely pleased with the class.  Also I skipped Spanish 50 and took it after Spanish 40 and while difficult I felt that I was more than fine and had a fantastic experience.","I really appreciated the opportunity to work at a bilingual school, as someone who hopes to teach in bilingual schools in the future. I also appreciated how our academic discussions in section informed my work in the field.","This class is great if you want some real-life experience in the Latino community. Your listening and speaking will improve quite a bit as you engage with natives, have discussions in class and write essays. But be prepared for a pretty hefty time commitment; this class if three hours of section time per week, pretty regular homework, papers, and a four-hour commitment to go work in a community organization in the Latino community. It'll pay off though, so it's really a trade-off.","Do the readings. Do the readings. Do the readings. ENGAGE IN THE CLASS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. You learn so much about yourself and about Latin American culture if you do what is required of you. You will get so much out of the class if you do this!","Requires a lot of time, but is fun and exciting, and brings in application which is the best way to learn a language.","es un curso fant\u00c3\u00a1stico en todos los sentidos. las lecturas y pel\u00c3\u00adculas te van a encantar; son tan interesantes como pertinentes en tu vida, y vas a aprender mucho al discutirlas en clase - profesora parra es maravillosa. \u00c2\u00a1por favor, toma este curso si puedes!","This is a creative and ambitious course that doesn't always quite live up to its goals. You will not always feel like your class time is being used well, but you will learn some new things about the Latino experience in the U.S., and you will (probably) enjoy your volunteer placement. Your Spanish skills will definitely improve. Like any class, the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it.","Although my volunteer work with this class was not as fulfilling as I thought it would be, it was still a very interesting experience and I am really glad to have had the chance to get to know the people and community I was working with.  The main component of this course however is the classroom time, which was a bit disappointing because I wish it was more focused on the volunteer work.","Definitely take this class!  It is so enlightening!","This is by far the best Spanish class I've taken at Harvard. The class does a brilliant job at incorporating relavent material into course work and our volunteering positions. If you can, take this class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Get excited! it's a great course and you'll leave more informed about the world around you.","This is a really great course to take if you're interested in the Latino community in the United States. The community service portion is unique, and getting to meet people very different from myself was one of the most instructive experiences I've had here at Harvard, but be aware that it represents a significant time commitment every week. Don't be like me and schedule it for a really inconvenient time. That being said, the rest of the course is not heavy - expect to write maybe 15 pages worth of material the entire semester. Most of your improvement with the language will come from volunteer work.  In class, Antonio is a riot, but at the same time we did get into some very involved discussions on the immigrant experience and Latino identity, which were pretty eye-opening, especially since people at Harvard are from such diverse backgrounds.","This course will help you become far more confident in your language skills. It will encourage you to truly think about the Latino community in the US and will give you a great background to approach current issues.","If you want to take a class that allows you to use Spanish outside of the classroom setting, then this is the perfect class for you. Getting paired up with an organization and using Spanish in the Boston\/Cambridge community was an amazing opportunity, and I learned a lot about the Latin@ community around Harvard. However, when you are signing up be sure that you can fit the 4 hour per week community service requirement (+ travel time) into your schedule. I found the material really interesting, and you definitely gain a new perspective on the Latin@ experience in the United States. Definitely take this class if you can!","If you have a background in the Spanish language and are interested in improving your skills, especially speaking skills, in a fun way that benefits the community then I would definitely recommend taking this course. The course is the normal 3 hours a week plus 4 additional hours of community service, which is definitely something to keep in mind, but the time you spend is worth the improvement you will see in your Spanish. Plus, the organizations you can work with for your service are all great, and you will have the opportunity to give back to community of greater Boston.","This class has a nice balance of written work, reading, film watching, and other types of assignments. Some good discussion. Not too much work outside of class besides volunteer commitment (which takes substantial time and money.) I think that the volunteer component can be extremely formative; it was for other students, at least. The organization I worked with (ASPIRING) had its volunteers doing art projects for four hours a week: not speaking Spanish with the students, not utilizing our skills for homework help, etc., which was a little disappointing. However, it was still neat to travel outside of Cambridge once a week and form relationships with other students at ASPIRING\/students in this course. Make sure you have the time to commit to this course! Final art project is really fun.","I would tell them that it's the best spanish class that I took at Harvard; that not only did my language competency - especially speaking - improve tremendously, along with my confidence with the language, but that I also genuinely had fun. It was wonderful to be able to combine service with learning, and the topics about which we read were well chosen; I feel as if I actually do understand the latino experience in the US, despite not being latino myself.","Take this course. The volunteer aspect of this course is unlike any other and will really get you into the community. While you will find this course take more time than traditional spanish courses at Harvard you get SO MUCH out of it. By virtue of that, I think naturally the people who self-select to take this course are really quite committed to bettering their language skills - making for far richer and nuanced discussions about really important issues that face the Latino community in Cambridge and across the US.","Excellent way to practice speaking spanish while at Harvard. Definitely do the readings.","You get to work as a volunteer in the community as well as analyze the theoretical and education components of the Latino community. Truly revolutionary class for my perspective on people."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["The class is great. Make sure you are willing to commit to the community service. My experience was valuable, but very difficult. Thinking and communicating in Spanish for four hours at a time is difficult and exhausting, Make sure you're ready for that component. That's not an issue grade-wise, but to do the kind of job you want to do with the people you'll be working with, make sure your Spanish is good enough. The class discussion was great. Essays were reasonable with interesting topics. There was not a big focus on grammar, for better or for worse. That didn't bother me, but this is not the class for you if you're looking to drill down your grammar. The class really improved my spoken Spanish.","The community service component is what really helps to solidify your comfort with the language.","Do the classwork!  It's so fun and complements the community service work.","Spanish 59 is amazing class- for people like me, who can't seem to find time to do community service in their free time but really would like to, this class is perfect. The service is really meaningful and has the added benefit of improving your Spanish!","This class is incredible because it draws together a wonderful and passionate group of students.  The conversations you can have in this class are amazing--and the readings and videos are very interesting.  The 4 hours of community service each week hugely adds to the amount of time this class takes up (and really will take up at least 4 hours each week!), making the hours\/week of this class much higher than most Spanish classes (because you still have readings, movies, essays on top of that).  That said, this class is TOTALLY worth it and more time-consuming (in a very worthwhile way) than stressful!  It is definitely my favorite Spanish class I've taken at Harvard and you won't regret the amazing conversations and friendships you form.  The community service component is also amazing, and in the end I really felt like I had a much deeper understanding than I ever would have thought possible of \"Spanish and the Community.\"  Be prepared to put in a bit of time, but if you do, you'll have a great experience!","I have no regrets taking this course, as the course material is extremely thorough while the volunteer work is fulfilling and engaging to the utmost degree. The only potential concern I would highlight is that this course will take a little more time than you expect. Volunteer work + readings and assignments can add up in terms of time, leaving you spending more time on this course than all other Spanish course of a similar level. Still would recommend with enthusiasm if you have the time.","A wonderful class that provides the perfect mix of theory and practice. Volunteering with the Spanish-speaking community of Cambridge was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my college career. Alberto is a pleasure to be around, and I hope he teaches the class in the future!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"14","response rate":"78.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 59","course_id":"4481","cat_num":"8789","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 59","course_id":"4481","cat_num":"8789","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 59","course_id":"4481","cat_num":"8789","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
