helpfully. Good mix of speaking, listening, and writing. Workload is not too punishing, but does keep you thinking.","Be prepared for the teacher to only speak to you in german starting on the first day of class.","German A is a great class.  The sections are small and everyone gets a chance to speak in class.  A lot of material is covered, but it is not difficult to retain.","Ich liebe Deutsch!","Pick up a course that has a native German speaker!","This class is a great way to learn a language.  I especially liked the fact that it was taught in German.  However, students with a lot of language background might consider doing Bab instead.","Expect that German is a hard language to start with.","This is a great way to learn the German language. It is well organized and not difficult if you do the work.","This course gives you the opportunity to talk with other classmates in German. Instructors of this course do not have a strong presence in the class room, as much of the time is spent in dialog with other students. Formal grammatical instruction is minimal. If you hope to be able to speak simple German phrases, this class will help you with pronunciation and vocabulary development. Writing is more or less addressed simply as transcribing verbal German. Understanding grammar, however, must be undertaken independently for the most part. It therefore requires a significant amount of time outside of class. This immersion-style course is a lot of work, because it must first be deciphered before it can be understood.","The class is an excellent way to start learning German.  Although the class being conducted entirely in German may seem daunting at first, you quickly become used to it.","German isn't an easy language to learn, but this class makes it as fun and painless as possible!","It is demanding, timeconsuming, but gratifying and effective. Sehr gut.","The course has great teachers and it is always great to learn other languages.","Block out an hour everyday just for German.  Read the grammar, do a wordchamp excercise or two.  Most importantly, have fun with the language.  Really take the time to explore the language and culture.  If you make the process more enjoyable, everything else will seem simpler and be easier to retain."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["It gives you a great preparation in German in only one year.","It's a decent course, but whether or not you enjoy it can depend entirely on the T.F.","Introductory language at the college\/graduate level is always a tricky endeavor. Everyone has preferences about the best way to handle it. I think German A hits a successful medium between \"whole language\" and grammar drills -- and both are important, because German is grammar-heavy and also not too easy to speak. A lot depends on the enthusiasm of the section leader, but the bones of the class are very solid. I was happy with my experience and feel I learned a good grammatical foundation for my continuing studies in German.","If you need a language core, then take German.  Small classes, great TFs, and an easy language to get used to.","It's possible to learn a lot of German in a single year!","enjoyable, but work hard. Homework is really a lot, but it is good to do.","Good class.","Deutsch ist eine gute Sprache!","Excellent introduction to German.","It's a good course and you will learn a lot of German, but language classes are a lot of tedious work.","prepare to learn German and have fun","That they will have to work hard but will be amazed to discover at the end of the year how much they know....","The midterm and final are difficult and focus a lot on grammar.  Class time was very enjoyable and a great environment to learn German in.  Homework is due every class period (Mon-Thurs) and is done mainly online.  Homework is helpful."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Just enjoy learning a new language and don't worry too much.","Be sure to read the grammar sections of the textbook with great care.","If you are at all interested in the German language, take the course.","Come in with the right mindset (like, wanting to learn German), and you'll learn a lot while having fun. It's a killer combo.","Although German is a difficult language to learn, it is also a fun language to learn. One benefit is that it isn't all that popular among students, so the classes aren't very big.","It's a good class if you want to learn German.","The class is well structured and Dorothea is a FANTASTIC teacher!","Make use of office hours. They're great opportunities to get one on one language tutoring.","If you have a choice, section with Tom Worth even if it means class at 9am four days a week.  It is worth it, no pun intended.","The work is constant, but never too much. The teachers i have heard are all very good, mine was at least. One of the more thorough language intro classes ive heard about and that has contributed a lot to my progress.","This class was a lot of fun, and challenging but not too difficult. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs to fill a language requirement or just as an elective.","German A is a well-structured class that also allows for its teachers to craft their own method of framing the material. Prof. Worth is excellent at getting everyone to participate and at creating a welcoming atmosphere for those who are a little shy about speaking in a foreign language (like me). In terms of materials, I thought that the combination of Quia, Wordchamp, and Textbook works very well. Wordchamp is great for learning vocab. I would recommend taking German at Harvard highly.","This class is a great break from the typical lecture course. it is fun but you learn a great deal very quickly.","German A is super fun. You learn a lot, and are speaking and reading very quickly. It's very laid back and fun. You get to know classmates and TF very well. Homework takes up a lot of time in the long run, but is manageable on a nightly basis. As long as you keep up with the homework, you don't need to study very much and are well prepared for the exams. Great elective, or to fulfill language requirement.","two words Tom Worth. Two more words, Quia \"schlect\" (bad in german)","Having homework everyday was annoying, but I put up with up because I feel that German is a useful language to know.","This class is really enjoyable, assuming you like languages and you like German."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["German is a fun language. It's similar to English in some ways, but there are some distinct differences. It is certainly more difficult to learn than one of the Romance languages. That being said, I would recommend it to anyone. That being said, it is a difficult language to learn and requires a lot of effort.","The amount of class time is too much for the amount you learn.  It would be fine to have so little work and learn so little if it didn't meet four days a week.","If you want to learn German, this is a great way to do it.","Find someone to speak with outside of class.","German A is one of the harder of the intro languages classes, but with a little extra effort you can get a lot of progress out of it. Choose your section time and TF carefully; that will have a big influence on your experience.","German A is excellent. Well taught, great materials, you learn a lot very quickly. Good job balancing and emphasizing all of reading, writing, comprehension, speaking. Very fun class, all the TFs are great.","This is the best way to learn a foreign language. The manner it is taught in is very fun, and the instructors generate enthusiasm. Guidance is provided through the year, and as long as you care about the work, then at the end of the year you'll be surprised at how well you can speak.","If you can be in Thomas Worth's section do it, it was one of the best experiences of my entire freshman year.  He is funny and class is a great time.","great","Language classes tend to be the best at Harvard, and German A was one of those. It might be a little overwhelming the first day, but it becomes effortless later on, especially given how encouraging the TFs are.","Tom Worth II that is all you need to know","It's like any other A level language class, and the teachers are really nice.","I would encourage them to find a teaching style amongst the instructors that fits their needs."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"41","response rate":"78.05","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GERMAN A","course_id":"2085","cat_num":"4294","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"11","5s":"14"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GERMAN A","course_id":"2085","cat_num":"4294","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"18","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GERMAN A","course_id":"2085","cat_num":"4294","1s":"1","2s":"16","3s":"11","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
