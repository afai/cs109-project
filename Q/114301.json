Time would be better spent reading on your own.","It's a lot of material, but you'll have a much better sense of the field after taking this course.","This course is interesting and worthwhile ot understand the human capital model, but the work requirements may go beyond what one desires in a graduate course.","larry cares so much."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["From the applied economics field courses, I think this could easily called  the best taught one.","Students should set themselves earlier deadlines to come up with a project for the term paper. It could so easily be something better than what you throw together in the winter break.

You should definitely take it if you plan on doing anything related to labor, public, development, or applied micro in general.","Work throughout the semester to synthesize understanding. You will not be asked to do this until the final, but you will have a much more complete understanding as you go if you do.","This is a great course to take if you are interested in labor economics, policy, or any kind of applied microeconomic theory.","the lectures by both professors are very worthwhile. Reading list is great, and if you are able to keep up with a good chunk of it, you'll get out a lot from the course.","This is a must-take course for any graduate student in economics and related fields.","If you are curious about Labor, this is a must-take course.  No excuses.  Try to grab the reading list ahead of time and start going through them, because they take time.  Lastly, read the lecture notes before class -- they are almost always posted beforehand so you can prepare questions.","It's more valuable if you do the reading","You should take any course you can with Professor Katz, he is a fount of knowledge and an enthusiastic lecturer!","If you are looking for an overview of the topics in empirical labor economics, this is the course you should take","Read as much as you can.  Also, make sure you have a clear understanding of the models.  Sometimes I felt like they were rushed through during lecture, but without the context of the models, the lecture about the empirics is hard to focus on.","Huge amount of material, but it's not really necessary to know all of the readings inside and out, and I don't think the profs expect you to.  Would recommend dividing the weekly readings among a study group and sharing summaries"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Great overview of labor literature.","This is a really fantastic course - even if you don't manage to absorb everything (and there's a lot), you'll walk away feeling much more knowledgeable.
