Although Prof. Higginbotham is an expert in the field, she is very respectful of students and nurtures their acquisition of knowledge.","Professor Higginbotham is an incredible teacher and resource to any student interested in African American history. The structure of the course--two books and a paper per week--lends itself to integrated historiographical learning as well as communal learning about a given period. Students are taught to teach each other, and gain an incredible wealth of knowledge of the field.","It is a great course to get a grip on the historiography of pre-twentieth-century African American history. It will help you understand the important themes of the field, and how historians have treated them. And it will let you read the \"classics\" of the field -- a great way to prepare for field exams, if you plan to take one in African American history."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.83","workload":"4.17","difficulty":"4.50","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 218","course_id":"84","cat_num":"9951","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
