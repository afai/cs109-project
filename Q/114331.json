That said, if you like Philosophy or History of Philosophy, it's an excellent way to do close readings of Empiricist texts.","This is a painless way for philosophy concentrators to fulfill their history of philosophy requirement. This material is not my favorite area of philosophy, but I actually found the class really interesting. Both the professor and TF are really good at explaining things, and there isn't a huge workload.","Great course, interesting material, phenomenal teaching staff.","This is a difficult and demanding course, but it affords students the opportunity to get a really in-depth look at the central empiricist texts.","Professor McDonough's lectures and the readings are wonderful. If one has any interest in epistemology and metaphysics, I would recommend this class wholeheartedly. I loved it.","professor mcdonough is great"]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["I have been proselytizing to everyone I know. This is an awesome awesome class -- it's particularly great for people who have a history requirement to take care of and need someone to hold their hand through the text, but also want an engaging and challenging class. It was really fun, interesting, and I even feel like I know a little bit about empiricism now.","It's not the most exciting course, so I wouldn't recommend it to most students, but I would recommend it to other philosophy concentrators.","This is one of those classes that changes the way you think about the world.","EXCELLENT! Professor Simmons is accessible, funny and makes the material really clear. The essay prompts are well thought out and section, dare I say it, was fun. An amazing course.","Professor Simmons is amazing. She is incredibly nice and approachable. Definitely go to lectures.","This course provides essential grounding in early modern theories of metaphysics and epistemology, which are both enmeshed in the moral philosophies of the period (including the ethical theories of the British empiricists themselves, notably Locke and Hume) and which later become points of reference for Kant and others who reject aspects of the empiricists' theories.","This class demands a quite a lot of time, but the readings are fascinating and one can expect to emerge with a solid understanding of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.","This is a great course, and Professor Simmons is an amazing lecturer who will not disappoint.  I would have preferred more big-picture discussion about the empiricist project in general, but I really enjoyed the more specific lectures and discussions, as well.  My first time reading Berkeley, and I thought it was a great environment for it.  I would recommend this course if for nothing other than the great subject matter (the empiricists really do deserve a semester of your time) and the quality of Professor Simmons's lectures."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["I would highly recommend this class for it exposed me to the value of studying philosophy from the history of ideas standpoint. I consider myself very fortunate to have been exposed to the philosophical thought of Berkeley and Hume. Also, the patient examination gave me the opportunity to think over, and appreciate the gravity of some of the issues discussed.","If you are at all interested in the philosophical thought that still inspires much of our contemporary scientific discussion, this course is an excellent introduction.","If you're interested in these topics, this is the class to take. Prof. McDonough is great!","This is a great class. Professor McDonough is an excellent teacher, the readings are manageable, and the papers are fun to write.","This is an incredible course, Professor McDonough is a must-take professor before you graduate, you will have a lot of fun, and of course, you will learn a lot about British empiricism in the process.  Could not recommend this course more strongly.","The material was fascinating, and Professor McDonough generates enthusiasm for it. I was engaged in class. However, I needed more direction in terms of what Professor McDonough was looking for in papers. There was a lot of material and not much guidance in terms of how to engage with it. Lectures at times got hard to follow.","This is a great class that picks up some interesting issues. Professor McDonough is wonderful! I would recommend this course.","This is a well taught and engaging course. Come to class prepared to discuss the readings because it is taught in a seminar style instead of the traditional lecture."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.17","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.55","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 122","course_id":"4049","cat_num":"9025","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 122","course_id":"4049","cat_num":"9025","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"10","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 122","course_id":"4049","cat_num":"9025","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
