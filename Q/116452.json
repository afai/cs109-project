He is brilliant, compelling, and exciting to learn from.","The course was way better than i expected it to be. Beside learning a lot of stuff thoroughly, my horizons expanded much with concepts and topics i do not yet fully comprehend, but the course gave me some idea of them and desire to learn further."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The course content is great, and the lectures are good, though they can sometimes be confusing and mixed up. In those cases, it is best to ask plenty of questions and start a class discussion - these always helped me understand the material better in the end.","This class is a fantastic intro to the classical motivation behind algebraic geometry.","A great introduction to AG!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is amazing.","Melody is a great teacher! Give her feedback and she will take it into account and make the course even better for you! Also, Cox, Little O'Shea is a great text for AG (much mroe readable than the other classic texts). I also like the tiny bit of algorithmic\/computation aspects injected into the class.","The material is fascinating, and Melody is a fantastic lecturer.  Problem sets were, by the end, pretty involved, but it was a very friendly and fun course.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Definitely take this class!","Melody is great. By far one of the best teachers I've had in the math department. Take anything Melody teaches. The material (algebraic geometry) was interesting, and the Grobner basis perspective was very nice. It was fun to work together on problem sets with the others in the class. The course covered a lot of material and ended up being a bit of a challenge for many of us, but I found it to be very, very worthwhile.","This class, probably because it was taught by Melody, was just awesome.  The lectures were very well done, and we got through a substantial amount of material especially because Melody was so thoroughly prepared and knew which details to skip over and which ones to lay out full.  It was very apparent that Melody spent a good deal of her time making the course great.\r\n\r\nThat aside, this class is a great place to either pick up some algebra or solidify your commutative algebra knowledge.  It gives a good intuition as to why we care to study about some of these rather artificial looking algebraic objects (like, why would you care about a radical of an ideal, or that it is graded, or that it is prime, and so forth).  With a good geometric picture always accompanying the algebra, with this course you can definitely get a taste of why algebraic geometry is so big.","Algebraic geometry is a very interesting subject and I learned a lot taking this course with Melody. She is a great instructor and has high expectations for all of her students. However, this course changes a lot based on the instructor, so if Melody is not teaching it, I would make sure the instructor is good before enrolling."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.20","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 137","course_id":"2867","cat_num":"0556","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 137","course_id":"2867","cat_num":"0556","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 137","course_id":"2867","cat_num":"0556","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
