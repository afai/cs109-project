Even though the class has about 50 students, it feels very small and discussion based. Professor Merseth is amazing at generating enthusiasm and really engages with all her students. There was a sense of community that she built. She also gets some amazing guest speakers to talk about various issues facing education.  The TFs were all extremely passionate and good teachers and contributed in both lectures and section. The course is neither easy or unusually hard, but all the readings and papers are extremely interesting to write, because they force you to rethink so many of your perceptions. I must have changed opinions on issues of education 100 times this semester.","Kay and the teaching fellows are the kindest and most engaging teachers. They care to know who you are and they know that you feel stressed out and are willing to help. The class is set up in a way so that its not about lecture but about learning collaboratively. The papers are interesting to write because you really get to choose a topic that you found most interesting and write about it, there are almost no limitations. You learn to question the value of an American education and the processes going into schooling and learn to want to defend it and change it. It makes you think critically about social justice through education. It is a very chill class and the people in the class if they are willing to listen to ideas and oppose one another at times you learn a lot. I honestly think this will be the best class I've ever had in three years, because it made my freshman fall exciting.","Professor Merseth was so amazing! She is a terrific instructor and so inspiring. We had great guest lecturers and the teaching team supported us throughout the semester. This course felt like such a community and I really enjoyed each exercise we engaged in to bring in different topics. They enhanced my understanding of issues and also kept me awake every time!","If you want to take it, then take it! Kay Merseth is an excellent teacher and loves to teach. Everyone gets to know you even when you think they don't and you will be challenged to fall asleep in lecture.","Know what's expected of you for assignments. A lot of times, what's said to the big group in lecture does not correspond to what your TF is looking for. Be careful to substantiate your opinions.","Professor Merseth is one of the best professors you will find - at Harvard or anywhere else. There were a few kinks in the class, but I'm sure she will iron them out. The exposure to great educational minds cannot be rivaled.","By far the best teaching I have ever experienced at Harvard! You will receive fantastic feedback on your writing and way of thinking about education. Lecture is extremely interactive, fun and quite different from traditional lectures with tons of slides and little to no student-teacher interaction. You will explore adventurous learning and have tons of learning experiences that will challenge your own views on education!","Education is deeply important to our lives and futures, and something that needs to be addressed in the country.  This class will at least give you a way to think about it and be better informed going forward.","The assignments call for a very direct interpretation of the reading, so be ready to support support support. The material is very interesting; Kay is an awesome person and professor; and you really become excited about the prospect of change in the country.","TAKE THIS CLASS! So engaging, and you will learn so much.","This class is awesome. You have to take a class with Merseth sometime in your college career. The teachers were always so excited and each one really knows their stuff. Don't slack in this class though. Thats the quickest way to get in their bad favor. Participation is a must but definitely not a drag. Everyone in the class always has something to say. The class is very close to one another.","If you are interested in education, this is a fantastic class to take as an introduction. Not only do you learn a lot about American K-12 education, but you also get a chance to experience a different style of teaching that is not present in regular Harvard courses.","This is an amazing class for many reasons: 1) the teaching is fantastic--you don't realize what you're missing until you take a class with Ed school professors, 2) you can draw on your own experience in school, 3) the class engages multiple learning styles, and 4) the readings and personal experiences of the teaching team are inspiring.","If you are at all interested in education or education reform, TAKE THIS CLASS! It was my favorite class of the semester--really interesting and applicable! Merseth is a great professor--she's very engaging and approachable. Overall, a fantastic class--everyone loved it! Plus it counts as a Gen-Ed. At the end of the semester, Merseth had us over to her house for a class party, and we couldn't stop talking about how much we loved the course!","This was by far one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone remotely interested in education.  Professor Merseth will get you engaged and thinking deeply about the many dilemmas in American education today.  You will emerge with a solid understanding of American educational history and current problems as well as potential solutions to those problems.  The reading are all modern, relevant, and interesting.  Every class is set up as a short lecture at the beginning and then small group activity and discussion as well as whole-class discussion.  I think I learned as much from my peers as I did from the readings!  It is an amazing experience to get to bond with 50 classmates, to get to really understand where they're coming from and what they are likely to say about each issue.  The TFs all come from different and interesting backgrounds and bring thought-provoking perspectives to the class.  Honestly, take this class, please.  Whether it is to fill your U.S. in the World requirement or just to learn more about education, you won't regret it.","This is one of the best classes that you will ever, EVER take at Harvard.  It's personal, powerful, and important.  This is my senior year, so I do not say that lightly.  Take this if you possibly can.","The class is definitely engaging - it's very different from any other \"lecture\" classes here on campus. It compels you to think on-the-spot, really take a stand, and defend your point. It's quite stimulating.","I loved this class!  Get to know your TF and Professor Merseth!  They are  truly dedicated to the students in the class and to the material they teach.  It provided an excellent introduction to the history of education in America, and provided the tools to formulate an educated opinion on schooling in America.","a fabulous class!","If you are the right audience for this class, then it is wonderful.  By \"right audience,\" I mean, if you care about the huge impact that education has on the future of the world.  There were very few times when I felt that we were wandering aimlessly, which is impressive for a humanities course.  Take it.","Overall, a very good class. Dr. Merseth is a fascinating individual and a good lecturer. The material we studied is very applicable to the real world-- I have never had so many people outside of the college interested in any course that I have taken like this one. The workload is relatively heavy (~5 papers) but the material is interesting and the course is well-taught.","Throw yourself into this class 110% percent.  It will change the way you look at American education, society, politics, everything.  \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\"","This class was life changing. A really inspiring class that gets you fired up about making a positive change in the world.","The people make this course. Professor Merseth and the teaching staff are so amazing and personable and passionate about what they do. You will want them in your life.","This was one of the best classes I've taken in my life. This is not a gen-ed to take simply to fill a requirement. It is a gen-ed to take to educate and cultivate a passion.","THIS IS THE BEST CLASS. If you have any interest in education, or even if you just want an engaging and life-changing way to fill a Gen Ed, this is the class for you. Class was the highlight of my week, every week. Merseth and the TFs are superb. The class, although there are over 45 students, is effectively run as a discussion, not a lecture. There is a ton of support for every assignment and the feedback is useful. There are many guest speakers that add to the rich variety of information presented in the course. This course will provide you with the information to force you to take a stand on dilemmas in education. I literally left each class with a completely altered worldview.","This was honestly the exact type of class I had hoped to take when I got to college. The coursework was interesting and extremely important to today's world, the teaching staff was incredibly supportive and approachable, the assignments were thought-provoking, guest speakers (including Dean Minow of Harvard Law School who spoke to us about Brown v. Board) supplemented class readings and made the topics of the readings feel much more personal and real-life, and Professor Merseth, through her questions during class and other methods of guiding class discussion, created a class atmosphere in which we were pushed to challenge our own beliefs and consider the beliefs of others. Even though there was a decent amount of reading, it was always worth doing in order to be able to take part in class discussions, have the chance to talk to the teaching staff about the subjects of the readings, and learn more about America's education system. For people who are even remotely interested in education in America: TAKE THIS CLASS. For people who aren't sure if they are interested, or even for people who don't think they are: TAKE THIS CLASS and I am almost certain you will become interested. This class focuses on issues that are both important in today's world and that are often either misunderstood or not thought about by most people.","Take this class!  If you are at all interested in education and want to make a difference for kids in this country, this is the class for you.  You are sure to be inspired by the books you read and the professor and TFs to help change the American education system!  It is quite a lot of reading, but very interesting reading.  You can get by without reading all of it, but you will get more out of the class if you do read everything.  Most of the work is writing the 4 papers, but they will really make you think about what you are learning.","This course is a good experience. The teaching staff really cares about you, and by the end you sort of feel like a big family with the other students and the teaching staff. \r\n\r\nNote that this course is less focused on the actual practice of teaching or education (i.e. what are effective classroom management practices or good suggestions for designing a curriculum), and more on how these different aspects of education, and the culture of education in general, impact the ability of schools to deliver an excellent and equitable education. You might also say this class is more about education reform than about education itself. Recommended for anyone interested in education, but if you are interested in some specific aspects such as curriculum design or childhood development, you will want to take other classes as well.","This class  is very engaging- it literally got me perplexed and angry about issues I have never thought of before. For the first time, this class did a great job.","This class was awesome! I learned so much, Dr. Merseth was fantastic and so personable and invested in getting to know her students. Though there are a TON of readings and doing them all doesn't necessarily help you in class, it really does help during the paper-writing, especially if you are going into the class with no prior knowledge about education in America.","The best class I've taken at Harvard. You would be stupid not to take this to fulfill the GenEd. The teaching staff is fantastic and accesible. They carry their vision through the class in a way that is clear, well organized, and powerfully engaging.","This class is life changing.","Don't miss out on this class - it's one of the best I've taken here, particularly among Gen Eds. The teaching staff, led by Kay Merseth, is very dedicated to teaching well and making sure everyone gets attention. Even more importantly, they're interested in you as a student, and are willing to meet individually frequently for academic or nonacademic reasons. Furthermore, the public education system is one of the most important policy issues today, and this class does an excellent job of getting you to think critically about relevant issues and defend your arguments.","One of the best courses I have taken in my four years at Harvard. Requires genuine interest and willingness to be pushed back and forth to gain a clear idea of what equity and excellence really means in today's educational system.","Prepare to be extremely dissatisfied after classes, because (a) it was difficult to get all your ideas into the discussion, (b) someone expressed an opinion that severely bothered you, or maybe (c) you still aren't really sure what your opinion is. It's a good thing. The point of the course is to get you to deal with broad, sometime vague, and uncomfortable questions, and force to you define it and stick with a position. So make sure this is a topic that you care about! The TFs have really valuable teaching experience to speak from, and the professor is wonderful to talk to about anything. Go to her office hours.","Be prepared for lots of reading and writing. Take notes! They help! Start early on essays!","This class was AMAZING! If you are at all interested in pursuing a career in education, this class is a must take. Professor Merseth and the teaching fellows deeply care about each student. Additionally, all have a history in education and teaching so they all know how to teach effectively. Take it. Take it. And if you're still contemplating whether to take the course or not, take it.","Take this course! You won't regret it."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This course, though sometimes very challenging in the amount of work and types of questions asked of you, is the most rewarding experience I have had the opportunity of having at Harvard. The chance to work with a teaching staff who is composed of TEACHERS made the class so much better as they knew how to support us, question us, and continued to change the course to our needs and liking. Everyone at Harvard has mastered the education system, so even if you are not thinking of pursuing education in the future, I still recommend this class above all other USWs because it is applicable and, excuse the clich\u00c3\u00a9, life-changing.","If you know nothing about education, be prepared to have your mind blown. If you feel you have some expertise on the subject, be prepared to read a lot of interesting things, think about new topics, but also have to listen to a lot of potentially offensive lecture comments by students who have been less exposed to urban problems than you have been.","This is a good class. It is very time-consuming though. Do not take it with a full class load. It will push you and make you think, but it can be easily discouraging.","The grading is hard and they do not fully explain why it is so hard. They will give you rubrics but the rubrics are vague, unclear, and unhelpful. Do not take it for fun. It is not easy.","Possibly one of the best Gen Ed classes offered at Harvard, though you must understand that this also makes it a difficult class. Do not expect to breeze through this class. The teaching staff and professor Merseth put a lot into making this a great course. This results in two things: 1) it is a great course; 2) the expect that equally you put a lot into being a great student in the course. There is a lot of reading (particularly given that it's a Gen Ed), and you can't get away with not doing the reading.","I feel as if many people say this about classes at Harvard, but BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Okay, seriously, I have never experienced a class at Harvard that has intellectually challenged me as much as this class. This class and the teaching staff will encourage you to think in ways you have never thought before about U.S. education. The teaching staff know HOW to teach. They get it. Sections are so fun, lectures are a blast! Course readings are decent length, but SO interesting! TAKE THIS COURSE!","This is a good class for learning about education, but they treat you like babies who don't know how to learn or read. Very low-level approach.","A lot of work, but very interesting, and Kay is a great professor. It helped me understand the importance of education in the U.S. at a much deeper level.","It's very much an introductory class -  not appropriate for people who have spent a lot of time thinking about these issues.","GO TO KAY'S OFFICE HOURS MORE THAN ONCE. Engage in the texts. Volunteer at a low-performing school in Boston. Meet with your TF before the paper so that you can really understand what the assignment asks of you.","The teaching team is incredible and are the most dedicated I have ever encountered. The course surveys a wide range of educational issues and pushes students to think about the deeper conflicts underlying these issues. However, I often found the course frustrating because I felt that the issues raised in class were never resolved, and I found few answers to the critical problem of education reform in the United States.","I would tell future students not to get frustrated with what may seem like an unsolvable problem. The point of the class is not to find all the solutions to the problems in American education, but to gain a better understanding of how such problems arose, how they are affecting lives, and how they could possibly be solved.","This is a must take class.  Professor Merseth really cares about her students and understands education issues.  She asks provocative questions and she along with the entire teaching team really help you to get to the heart of the education crisis facing our country.  A harvard must.","This isn't a class: it's a coalition of people all passionate about the future of education. Know that if you decide to be enrolled here, you are responsible for keeping yourself informed about the issues and actively participate in class. It makes the experience so much better if you decide to do so.","this is a must take for people interested in education...the time commitment is large for a general education but worth it","Come with an open mind. Be passionate about what you're passionate about but leave your opinions open to change.","If you are the kind of person who likes studying contemporary issues, etc. you will enjoy this class.","One of the best, if not THE BEST, class I've taken in four years at Harvard. Kay and the TFs care about your work and your lives and couldn't be more helpful. There was not a single day that I regretted going to lecture or section, which is more than I could say for most of my other classes. \r\n\r\nIf you can get into this class, do it. You won't regret it. Might even change your life.","EVERYONE AT HARVARD NEEDS TO TAKE THIS CLASS. I had never been seriously interested in education until taking this class, and now I know that whatever I do in the future must involve tackling the education dilemma in some way.","It is possible to get a lot out of this class; it seemed obvious that many students were deeply affected by the class, but there were others who were not.  This is not an easy yet interesting gen-ed.  There is a lot of reading, and the papers are not graded easily by any measure.  If you are very passionate about education reform in America, this class may be a wonderful experience for you (although you may also find it frustrating given how little opportunity you frequently have in section and class to really hear others' and voice your own opinion).","This class is cool. The lecture material is sometimes interesting, but the readings really are the highlight. It is however, graded too harshly, and the discussion environment is too aggressive. There is also a strange focus in the assignments. You can't focus on your own interpretations, and you have to write exactly what the teaching staff wants you to. So although course readings are great, the assignments do not contribute to the experience.","This class was life-changing. It was so incredible to be taught by a team of teachers that were so effective in communicating their passion about a subject - and so successful in fostering engaging and thoughtful discussion.","Take it! It's an amazing course. The teaching team is great and the readings, though more than those in most gen-ed classes, are really interesting. Class discussions are active and enlightening. \r\nThis class will really challenge you to think about issues in the American K-12 education system. It will change your perspectives on the subject and provide new angles you have never thought of before.","Absolutely fantastic course. Katherine and Sarah, the head TF, are simply terrific. They are deeply inspirational. My only regret is having taken this course so late in my Harvard career (as a senior). You deal with very crucial issues: race, immigration, poverty, and an array of other real topics. I find myself continuing to banter about education reform when others bring it up quickly and then it grows into a major topic of discussion. Loved this class- one of the best I have taken in all four years, and I know I will definitely be getting involved in education in my economics coursework. I usually have at least a few critical comments for classes I have taken, but I am not sure there is anything I would really change, save for perhaps a slightly smaller class size. Thank you Kay and Sarah!","If someone asked me what course they had to take at Harvard it would be this one.  It is just too good.  The class is diverse in opinions and that has led to some of the most incredible conversations.","This course is phenomenal - I learned so much about our K-12 education system, and, while gaining an appreciation of how tough the dilemmas we face are, left feeling inspired to effect change as a result of the positivity and energy of the whole teaching team. Prof. Merseth is fantastic and takes more interest in her students than any other professor I've had. Overall, the staff puts so much effort into making this a great experience. I was frustrated in our discussions at times, but looking back I realize that the disagreements I might have had with different viewpoints that were expressed were one of the more valuable parts of this class. I was forced to both define what I actually believed and then constantly reevaluate those beliefs. If you have any interest in education, inequality, American society, or just taking a great class, TAKE THIS CLASS!","don't take if you are looking for an easy gen ed, but the course is really interesting but you are held to a high standard for work","It's a lot of work and really forces you to think, but great!","Definitely take this class should be lotteried in!! It will definitely transform your thinking:-)!","Incredibly dedicated teaching team!","Came for the gen ed requirement, stayed for the life-changing experiences","If you can get into this class, you should absolutely take it.  This class will definitely be one of the most memorable of my undergraduate career, and it has changed my life.  I learned so much about myself through examining my own educational background, as well as so much about the United States.  Examining the U.S. through education systems allows you to see and discuss so many structural issues of this country that are rarely mentioned in other courses.  This class was refreshing, enlightening, engaging, and so much fun.","You will love this class! without a doubt!!!","If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity, take this course.  Unlike most of the people in the class, I actually had some reservations about taking it at the start.  I was originally just looking for a quick and easy way to satisfy my U.S. in the World gen ed requirement, and I thought that the readings and essays in the class were a bit more than I bargained for.  But as the class progressed, I began to realize how truly fascinating and relevant the topic of education is.  K-12 Education is something that we're all familiar with, and yet at the same time have thought so little about.  This class caused me to totally rethink my future plans in life and made me realize how much work needs to be done in the field of education.  Professor Merseth is incredible - she makes an effort to get to know every member of the class - as are the rest of the teaching team.  Maybe USW 35 wasn't the easiest way to satisfy my requirement, but I'd take it again any day.","The class is interesting and does a good job of letting you explore your views. However, the types of opinions represented in the class are not the full spectrum, making the class not exactly an open discussion. Also, the class is way too intense, especially for a Gen Ed. Make sure you are really interested and are ready for the work.","Absolutely take this course! This was my favorite course in my 5 semesters at Harvard.","This course will change your life. This was by far my favorite course this semester. Dr. Merseth, the teaching team, and everyone enrolled in the class provided unique perspectives on the issues discussed in class. After every lecture I always felt motivated and inspired to make a change in our education system. The readings were insightful and a pleasure to read.","This is a great class if you have any interest in education. If you make the most out of this class, it can be very beneficial and super engaging. It is not as easy as some typical gen-eds (there is a fair amount of reading) but the workload is super manageable and if you put in the effort, you'll do well.","Expands your perspective on education and how it relates to society. Inspires many to pursue possible resolves to the dilemma of education","This is honestly the best class I have taken at Harvard! The teaching staff is incredibly supportive and really pushes your learning. All of the readings and topics covered are incredibly relevant and important. Overall it was a pleasure to take this class. Be ready to fully engage in readings and discussions in order to get the most out of it.","YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS COURSE. This class is one of the best I have taken at Harvard. It changed my way of thinking--I feel like I am a different person as a result of this course. If anything, this course will show you how a college course should be taught--where each student is considered an individual, where section is as enjoyable as lecture, and where the teaching staff are so dedicated to the material and their students that you cannot help but put as much into this course as you can.","This class was carefully developed and crafted by the teaching team, and it definitely showed - sections were meaningful and lectures by Prof. Merseth were compelling and relevant. Guest lectures were wonderful, and the class incorporated school visits and also required us to reflect on our own educational experiences, which I had never done before. The course forces you to think about your own stance on education, your past educational background, and your hopes for the future, and discussions are incredibly salient and will stay with you forever. It is so important that we all be educated about our educational system, and if you are at all interested lottery to take this class! The class was also unique by allowing any interested students to participate in discussions outside of class, so that Prof. Merseth is clearly devoted to enhancing all Harvard students' understanding of education. Prof. Merseth and the teaching staff are all so caring and wonderful and really want us to succeed - I have rarely had such a considerate professor who truly wanted every student to meet with her, grow, and feel comfortable. Thank you!","An extremely well-taught class, where all of the teaching staff care deeply both about you and about teaching a course in the best way possible, with great attention to feedback and improvement.\r\n\r\nWill change how you see education, and with it, society as a whole. Weekly readings may get kind of long, but they are enjoyable if you dive into the course subject.","This is a great class, possibly the best I have taken so far at harvard. It will literally twist your brain in knots and change the way you think. However, if you want to fully benefit from all that it offers, you need to plan on bringing a serious commitment to keeping up on the readings, assignments and participating. This is not a class that you can sleepwalk through (or that you would ever want to). It is simply too rich and too important a subject matter, with incredibly intelligent, committed teachers. Bring your A-game and you will get so much out of it!","It's a great class to take if you're already interested in education, but I can't help but think that it would be better and more educational for students not already interested in the field (however, there are problems associated with that too). That said, I learned a lot and the teaching staff was wonderful. It seems like a lot of times, students brought their emotions and feelings into the classroom, and I personally didn't like that. I wanted to discuss arguments and ideas on tough dilemmas in education, but it seemed like others were more interested in discussing how they felt about these ideas. This made it tough to have great discussion sometimes. It's harder to say someone's feelings are unreasonable than it is to discuss why you think their thoughts about a reading are unreasonable. \r\n\r\n-Lots of great guest speakers!","Take this course. It is very well organized and will give you a lot of important perspectives on education in America (its history and current debates). It will make you expect more of your TF's and professors in the future, and it will push you to think deeply about your own assumptions, not just about education, but about everything from race and class to opportunity, motivation, and human learning. And its a really excellent way to fulfill USW.","This course is amazing. First, because it is intentional about teaching. I've never seen another Harvard class work so consciously to improve itself each year and throughout the semester, and it shows. Second, because the ideas are powerful and the course asks each student to engage with their own beliefs in relation to the material. If you have any interest at all in education (and I hope you do), take this course. It is an inspiration.","Definitely take this class -- the definition of GenEd, it teaches information you need to know as an American citizen.  Everybody leaves this course with a new perspective (or many) on the public education system and with a more profound interest in the subject.  It's fun, too!","The class is very well done, but does not go very deeply into the issues, even the controversial ones; while I did learn a lot, seeing as I didn't know much about education beforehand, my views were not challenged nearly as much as the introduction at the beginning of the course led me to believe they would.","Everyone should take this class. More people need to understand how important our education system is and the issues that affect the system.","I would absolutely recommend this course with the warning that the reading and expectations exceed those typical of a Gen ed.","This is an excellent course. It definitely has a liberal bias, but the instructors also encourage different opinions and facilitate excellent discussions. I feel more informed about the current education system and inspired to get involved.","This course will challenge every single one of you opinions and ask you questions you had never even considered.  Even if you are not interested in education for a future career, this is a great entry into a topic that inevitably affects every individual living.","This is a great course. A lot of reading, and the papers are challenging, but if you do the work, you get a lot out of this class.","A really great class with a really dedicated and knowledgeable teaching team. More work than expected, but worth the effort.","This class is a lot of work, but it absolutely worth taking.  I'm bummed that it's only one semester."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Great course for anyone. Do not have to want to go into teaching or  education to get a lot out of the course.","Take it if you want to explore how complicated are issues of race and class in education.","I recommend this course with enthusiasm. It is probably THE BEST way to fulfill USW. It has been an incredibly impactful and valuable experience for me in large part because it gave me the opportunity to explore issues of race and class. There are so many cool and unique aspects of this course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c school visits, non-traditional lectures, participatory classes, interesting guest lecturers, no exams,  and a teaching staff who REALLY know how to teach. Learning from Professor Merseth is such a treat. She is unbelievable devoted to making the course a positive and meaningful experience for all of her students and she takes the time to really get to know everyone.","If you are in any way interested in education, take this course. Prof. Merseth is amazing! She takes the time to get to know everyone in the class and help connect your experience to what we are in the class. Even if you aren't normally taking classes in this area, I find that this is a relevant and meaningful subject for everyone to take  a look at.","Great course! Papers are graded pretty hard but the class is worth it. Professor Merseth is the best--get to know her!","Take this course. Your perspective and knowledge base will grow, not only in terms of the Education System, but the country's socioeconomic, racial, and cultural spheres. You'll also meet incredible, passionate students, exemplary educators, and distinguished guest speakers. Your beliefs will be changed almost every time you come to class and you may leave at the end of the semester ready to take up a career in Education (be careful of this, I'm serious).","This is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Professor Merseth and the rest of the teaching team are 100% dedicated to making sure each student learns, is challenged, and has a positive experience with the course. It is a good survey into the challenges facing American education and engenders strong and lively discussion. Although I found the material at times to be somewhat simplistic (I would have preferred some of the arguments to be a little more nuanced), this is the type of course that will make you question your beliefs, your place in the world, your background, and how you want to devote your life. I hope you take this course - you won't regret it.","This is a phenomenal course. If you have the opportunity to take this class, do not hesitate. I was on the fence about taking the class but I absolutely do not regret it and honestly wish I could take it again. The teaching staff is incredible and unbelievably dedicated to your learning. The class will not only help you better understand education in America, but also will help you realize ways you can help improve it. This is perhaps the only class I have taken here that I can undoubtedly say after that it has changed my life.","This class should be required for anyone interested in working in politics or education. The guest speakers are fantastic and the readings really hold your attention. The only annoying thing about the course is that it can feel like a parody of a social science\/humanities course sometimes, as people share their personal experiences and feelings in lecture all the time. Greater weight is placed on anecdotes than data.","This class really made me think about my experience with education and how that shaped who I am. I changed a lot of my beliefs throughout the course of the semester and was challenged to consider other perspectives other than my own. The teaching staff is wonderful and thought-provoking, but a lot of the feedback on papers seemed critical and nit-picky. I often felt isolated and insecure if my opinion wasn't the general opinion of the class (the class's views were generally fairly liberal). Prof. Merseth is the best professor I've ever had at Harvard. She really cares about her students and knows how to lecture really well.","Take this class!! You will learn so much and the teaching staff is really great. Kay works really hard and cares a lot about her students. The essays will make you think and are challenging, so start early!","Best class I have ever taken at Harvard. You will not meet a professor who cares more deeply about her students than Professor Merseth. You will learn a lot of things you didn't know about the American education system. You will think fundamentally differently about your own educational experience at the end of the course. You may change your path entirely because of what you learn. Take this course!!","This is the best class you will take at Harvard. Every student should have the experience offered by this course.","This class is PHENOMENAL. Topics covered are essential to understand as a participant in US society. You will be pushed to challenge and deepen your own ways of thinking about society and your place in it. The teaching staff is incredible and care deeply about your own growth and who you are as a person. You will make great friends in this class. Your ideas are listened to and valued. Definitely one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. Everyone should take this class. Unfortunately it's lotteried--if you don't get into the lottery, keep trying each semester.","This class is inspirational. I learned so much about the education system which I hadn't even considered before. It exposed problems in our society that are troubling and deserving of our attention. The classes were great, and the teaching team is really talented. There was a lot of reading and papers but all of the work felt worthwhile.","The lessons learned are invaluable. Be prepared for the workload!","Prepare to have your beliefs challenged.","Such an incredible course! This course has challenged me to rethink my views on education. Professor Merseth is so caring and a great instructor. The teaching team genuinely wants students to learn. TAKE THE CLASS!","wonderful course! made me rethink my post-grad interests.","I really, really enjoyed this class. The section component was particularly good, and you could get a lot out of the readings if you put the time in. Sometimes class discussion wasn't as productive as I would have liked, but even that improved somewhat by the end of the semester. Grading was at times a bit arbitrary, I think, but overall a good course, if a bit harder than your average Gen Ed.","MUST TAKE! This course is honestly one of the best (if not the best) of all courses available at Harvard. This course covers a topic with which we are all quite familiar and have lots of experience. The teaching team is great and experienced. You will learn to appreciate your education background, while also think about the problem with America's education system. Fun Gen Ed course that is also educational.","This course is very good in turning passive students into, if not active, then thoughtful ones. You cannot simply sit in the class and listen. You are forced to take a stance, and the openness of the environment to argument about contrasting opinions on education reform encourage you to become more invested in the issue.","This is the best class that I've taken at Harvard yet.  Kay's enthusiasm is contagious.  The TFs are incredible.  The discussions are thought-provoking.","While this class does cover extremely interesting subject material, I was not fully convinced by the lecture-discussion style of teaching and learning. Perhaps this is me as a student, but I just don't think truly productive discussion can occur in a lecture of 60 people. What should've been diverse, nuanced discussion, often just turned into a rally behind whatever opinion the majority of people thought best. While we discussed some very relevant, interesting topics, I do wish we had delved deeper. Nonetheless, this class does offer an unparalleled opportunity to -- at least attempt to -- parse out some VERY socially relevant topics that are important for EVERYONE to consider.","This is what they meant when they said general education. I won't trust you as a fellow voter before you've taken this course. It created a wonderful feeling of community. Academic rigor was sometimes sacrificed for applicability, but it was a reasonable tradeoff.","This is an amazing class and you should most definitely take it! Professor Merseth cares about each and every student, and while discussions sometimes talk about everyone's own high school experience, it fits well within the more rigorous course content and allows everyone to have a broader perspective. Take this and do not be afraid to talk in class about your own educational experiences, for they will add to a phenomenal discussion! Class is great and assignments are fair. Get to know Professor Merseth very well, too, because she is awesome!","This class has awesome discussion.  Get over the fact that sometimes they treat you like 4 year olds with stupid assignments and appreciate the larger discussions the course generates.  \r\n\r\nOn that note, this isn't a class that teaches you facts.  I was most frustrated with that with how fast we were going over history and problems -- it's a wide approach rather than deep.  This class is designed to generate discussion, and it does that well.","This course if fantastic -- if it were possible, I would ask that it be required of every student. The teaching staff generates and facilitates incredible class discussions and are very supportive of all views shared. Students are lucky to be under the supervision of Kay Merseth - she makes a point of getting to know each student and is a wonderful conductor of class discussions.","Be sure to spend time on essays, especially if you are not good at writing.","This course has it's incredible reputation for a reason - is is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.  Everything about it is excellent.  I strongly recommend it for anyone who has even a remote interest not only in education, but in social justice issues more generally.  This course made me want to pursue teaching. It is certainly not the easiest gen-ed, and you will be graded strictly on assignments, but it is absolutely worth it.","This is almost certainly the best class I have ever taken at Harvard. Whether or not you are well-versed in education reform policy, or you have no exposure whatsoever and have simply gone through the education system without putting much thought into it, this course will stimulate your interest in education and make you think twice about what you value. You will find new opinions, and walk away feeling like you've actually learned something, which is refreshing.","This class really opens your eyes about larger structural problems that underly the inefficiencies of our k-12 education system. The problems can sometimes seem overwhelming and the class will leave you with more questions than answers. The beauty of the course is that now you will begin to start asking the right questions and get one step closer to addressing the root of the problem and not just its symptoms. The readings and course materials are mostly interesting and section is a fulfilling learning experience.","Take this class!!!!! Even if you've already fulfilled this course, take it! It's absolutely wonderful. You will never meet a teaching staff who genuinely cares about you as much as this one..they are awesome! The conversations you will have in lecture and section will change your life\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6forcing you to think about education in new, fun, upsetting, and encouraging ways. The education that you thought was a 'given' for everyone is not. And it's no accident. This course teaches you about more than education, but about how American bureaucracy, politics, and economics affects education. Take this class..you will not regret it!!","This class KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK. Wow. I really don't have words to describe how fantastic this class is. They say there is a \"lecture\" two times a week....\"lecture\" is more of a BIG all-class discussion (\/debate...) about very thought-provoking topics. Everyone gets a name card and by the end of the semester, you'll know basically everyone's name and generally what their thoughts are on various topics. Sections are like a little family. The teaching staff POURS their heart and soul into this class, they genuinely want to make it awesome, and they are all so loving, caring, friendly, and truly want to get to know you. And not only you as a student. But you as a PERSON. That's so incredibly rare to find. You will leave this class a changed person. And if that sounds overly dramatic, then take this class and prove me wrong...I wish I could do it all over again. And again. And again.....and again. LOTTERY until you get in. Then soak it up because it'll fly by.","Great overview of contemporary issues facing the American education system that uniquely combines history with philosophical debates on the purpose of education. Do not be drawn away from the admittedly fluffy name of the class, and the first lecture or two. There are some superfluous debates here and there, but overall this class was very substantive. You will learn from classroom debates, and have a real opportunity to get to know other students who care deeply about education. This was a great course with excellent teaching staff who really care about building a community of personal, thoughtful, and substantive debate. Highly recommended to anyone interested in education issues.","This is the best course I've taken at Harvard!I felt like I learned something significant. The course instructors are amazing and always available to you.","this is the best class you can take at harvard","This is a great class if you are serious about learning about education and some of the ways we can go about reframing our educational system. The teaching staff for this classroom is great and I think that this may become one of the best courses that you take at Harvard. TAKE IT!","Take this course. There is no other piece of advice I can give. It is important that we are conscious of the current state of the US education system. This class will provide you with a number of resources that will help you form your own opinion.","Very engaging class that makes you think critically about a lot of issues facing the current educational system and weigh the costs and benefits of any interventions and reforms that could be applied. Professor Merseth is great, very passionate and very knowledgeable. Really looks out for her students and is a great mentor figure, especially for those looking to get involved in the educational space professionally.","This class will completely change your perspective on American education, and it's worth taking for that fact alone. This is a difficult class. The teaching staff expects you to put a significant amount of time and effort into the material, and their are high standards for the written work produced. But if you're willing to put the effort in, you will get a lot out of this course. This is by no means an easy gen ed, but it's a valuable one.","If you are interested in learning about education through history and current debates as well as future methods of reform it is a wonderful class to take. The staff and Prof. Merseth are awesome!","Be prepared to learn what it's like to be a passionate school reformer in a sea of ambiguity where everyone seems equally right and wrong.","TAKE THIS CLASS.  If you care about kids, take this class.  If you care about America, take this class.  If you care about the world, take this class.  Prof. Merseth is easily the most caring professor I've ever encountered and the teaching staff is wonderful.  This class will challenge you intellectually and push you to think critically.  It will also to expose you the wild and wonderful world of education.  And it's really not too too much work."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Everyone is going to tell you that you NEED to take this class. They're not wrong -- this class will make you a more informed citizen, and you will form opinions that you guide your thinking about many many different issues. However, I just want to suggest that the way this class is run is not for everyone. You will be asked to share your opinions with the whole class, whether you are ardent or tentative about them.","TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT. EVERYONE. The material covers issues that every person should know and care about and there is no better way to learn about them than in this class - USW35 redefined my vision of what a Harvard class, Harvard Professor, and Harvard TF can and should be, and as a second semester senior I can confidently say this was single-handedly the best class I took at Harvard. And while all of the content was incredible, the key aspect of this class is that readings, lectures and sections actually engaged me to think critically about my values and beliefs and really shaped the way I view the world. The class requires a lot of you but be ready to get back ten times of everything you put in. Bottom line - YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS.","If you care at all about education TAKE IT!!!","LOTTERY FOR THIS CLASS. This is the best-taught class at Harvard College, which is perhaps what you might expect, seeing as the staff is composed of people who taught (and taught well!) for a living. The readings are fantastic, you'll learn so much. I want to be best friends with Prof. Merseth, she's really cool.","TAKE THIS COURSE. One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Kay is an absolute gem. They make them different at the Ed School.  If you're anything like me, you'll learn quickly that your experience in K-12 differs sharply from other people's. You'll become well versed in the problems facing the education system as a whole and debate ways to solve them. You'll read some great readings, become close with your section, and look forward to class. There are few courses at Harvard that are this well thought out. Lottery until you get in. You won't regret it.","This course exposes you to the world of education along with the problems and opportunities that exist in the field. The staff was absolutely incredible. Each person was dedicated to ensuring that every student benefited from the course. It was the only class at Harvard that I have never been tired in during lecture. Lectures were incredibly engaging and interesting.","Without a doubt one of the best classes I've taken. You will learn, be challenged, and reconsider your beliefs. Professor Merseth is incredible and has a neverending wealth of compassion and devotion to her teaching and for her students. This course, though fairly large, is structured in a way that will allow you to get to know the other 50 or so members of the class on a critical academic, if not sometimes, personal level.  The time in this class passes by quickly. The assignments are difficult but there is a lot of support and good conversation to help. You will also get a chance to hear from some incredible leaders in the field of education.","Maybe my favorite class taken at Harvard so far. Merseth is so invested in her students and genuinely wants to form friendships with those she teachers. Class discussions are engaging and thought-provoking. In this class, we learned that in American education, there is no correct answer-yet through discussion you start to develop your own opinion on what the first step toward an equitable and excellent education should be","TAKE IT. It will be the best decision you make ever! If you're into education, this will be your playground. And even if you're not, Merseth will make you seriously consider what you are doing with your life and question why you're not going into teaching.","This class is GREAT. It is the one class at Harvard that I recommend everyone take. It's definitely a TON of work, but all of it asks you to reflect on your own educational experience.  The teaching staff actually cares about the students and actively seeks to form relationships with their students. Kay is also the best - by the 3rd or 4th week she already knows every student and talks to everyone before class begins!","Literally anyone can get so much out of this class whether or not you're interested in education. This is just such an important part of our societal structure, and it is fascinating that we don't study it in more detail. A great class to spark these discussions that we need to be having more often.","Amazing class in a fascinating subject matter. The reading is a lot but they are interesting and personally relevant to all students. Section is great because you get close to everyone there as a result of your in depth discussions. The different activities and formats of lecture and section are some of the most innovative I have been a part of.","Class is great. A lot of work on essays and a crapload of readings. Also Kay will call on anybody in class. Also if you miss high school social studies classes, this is the format. We watch youtube videos in class and have class discussions (for better or worse)","This class was my favorite class at Harvard.  You must take it by the time you graduate.  Kay is amazing and gets to know each and every one of you.  You truly develop as a person from this class.","This class is a great way to fill USW...come in with an open mind, but remain critical!  This class can be frustrating, there are more questions posed than solutions, but it helps you learn to think critically.  It is graded harshly and weirdly they are very strict about extensions, even with good reasons, so be cautious about that.  It is a lot of work, but most people seem to like it.","Hands down the best class I have taken in my 3 years here.  All other \"teachers\" at Harvard should be required to attend a seminar where Kay and the entire USW 35 teaching staff explain how they conduct and teach this course.  This is the first class I've taken here where I was engaged, look forward to going to class and section, and actually enjoyed doing the readings.  It's not an easy gen-ed, but you won't care.","This is a fantastic class. Professor Merseth gives awesome lectures and she really makes an effort to get to know everyone outside of class, to a far greater degree than I've seen from any other professors. I enjoyed every bit of this class - in addition to learning a great deal about American education, it helped me form my own opinions and \"take a stand\" on tough issues. My only caution is that the class is a lot of work - be prepared to commit a lot of time if you want to enjoy and do well in the class.","Come to this class prepared to think and question your beliefs. A lot of the assumptions and beliefs that I came to this class with were completely turned on their head. While it was scary and unnerving at first, I enjoyed every minute of it. This class really pushed me to think about education in a way that I hadn't before. It gave me a brand new perspective that I am excited to apply to my life now.","It's a lot of busy work, but worth it in the end.","Best class I've ever taken, not just at Harvard...ever.","The best class I have taken at Harvard. The lectures feel almost like sections at times (as in, lots of opportunities to participate). Professor Merseth deeply cares about every student, and goes out of her way to meet with everyone one-on-one to get to know you better (and will chase you weeks into the semester if you have yet to do it). The lecture topics are always interesting, and the course balances history with current situation perfectly. Also, the assignments make you think and reflect about your own schooling experience. The class also allows you to visit one high school in Boston that is the complete opposite of your type of high school, so it opens your eyes to different perspectives. The course asks challenging questions, but Merseth always makes it clear that the success of the class rely on the student's ability to answer, take risks, and take a stand on beliefs.","This class was the best class I've taken at Harvard. It forced me to think about things on my own, and it made me question my own beliefs on what I think is right and just in the American Education system. I also learned tons about the American ed system and I feel that I have an idea as to what can be done to better it.","This is hands down, the most engaging, best class you can take at Harvard.","Lottery this class! Kay Merseth is an awesome person to know. She will inspire you to get more involved and interested in education. She is extremely caring to all her students, and you will get to know her on a personal level. This is also the only course I've taken where everyone feels like a family. You will feel a special bond with your classmates and teaching staff when you leave.","This class was an amazing experience. Professor Merseth is not only extremely knowledgeable and passionate about this topic, but also the friendliest and most invested Professor I've had at Harvard. The subject itself is extremely engaging and applicable to all of us as students. The workload was challenging enough to make the class a priority, but never overwhelming, and I almost never felt like doing the reading or assignments was a chore. However, do be prepared to endure endless plugs to get you to go into teaching, they can be a bit incessant.","BEST CLASS AT HARVARD. LITERALLY. Take it because 1) Education is important and related to everyone's life 2) the teaching staff is phenomenal and the best at Harvard 3) Professor Merseth is an absolute LEGEND. Don't leave Harvard without getting to know her","The Best class I've ever taken!","You will learn a lot about the problems plaguing education","Best class I've taken at Harvard. Everyone does the reading because everyone loves the class. Great TFs, awesome discussions in section\/lecture. Learned a lot about myself and our country that I didn't know before. Definitely opened my eyes to the problems of our society, helped me understand them, and helped give me tools to break them down.","LOTTERY FOR IT AND TAKE IT NO MATTER WHAT. This course makes you think in ways that every American should about our education system, which is at the center of our society. The grading is tough and you have to do your readings, but it's all worth it!!","This class is one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Maybe the best one. Kay creates such a great environment from the classroom, and from the beginning, you feel like you're part of a family. Definitely don't underestimate the readings because there's a lot of them! The reading essays are standard, but the midterm and final paper are much harder essays because of the nature of the prompts. While I feel that we covered a lot of material in this class, I think the largest takeaway from the course is that these are difficult questions we grapple with. Take this class! It deserves the highest rating possible.","Is you don't do anything else at your time at Harvard TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!","This class is hands down the best class I have taken at Harvard yet. Not only will you learn more and question all of the assumptions you have ever held about education, teaching, and teachers - you will also experience one of the best-taught undergrad classes at Harvard. The culture of the class is great - Kay is personally invested in every one of her students - and all of the students are incredible resources to learn from as well. The work required to get the most out of this class is a little higher than your regular gened, but it is worth every extra reading and essay.","Don't graduate from Harvard without taking this course. It is a must!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class is definitely worth taking. If education policy doesn't interest you that much, you should still take it. Everyone should know how it works, and have the opportunity to take a class with Prof. Merseth, who is really a wonderful, wonderful woman. The class is made by the amazing teaching staff, and really only requires that you show up and do some thinking about the material. It is not meant to stress you out, but rather, to help you think critically about one of the most important, if not the most important, element of American society.","KAY IS THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER! SHE TRULY CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS AND SHE IS AMAZING! THE TFS ARE JUST AS AWESOME TO! TAKE THIS CLASS","The best class I've taken at Harvard. But you get out of it what you put into it. Do all the readings, not only because they're incredibly engaging and interesting, but because you will reap the benefits of a lively class discussion! But in all seriousness, it changed the way I think about American education, and made me interesting in becoming involved in education reform (I wasn't going into this course).","This is the only class I have been in in which I looked forward to coming to lecture every Tuesday and Thursday. This is the only class in which I have become really close to my entire section. Section involved discussions that weren't just performances for participation grades, but the conversations were about topics that we all genuinely cared about. Sometimes we would disagree, but I felt like I could share my own story, and my opinion was genuinely heard.","I haven't taken a gen ed class before, so I don't have a reference point, but I thought this was a challenging gen ed compared to most other gen eds","This is one of the best classes that I have taken at Harvard and it is one of those classes that reminds you that you are in a special institution of higher learning. There are a lot of readings for the class, but they are all worth it, and the teaching team is incredibly motivated and engaged with the students. If anything, take this class just to get to know Prof. Merseth.","I cannot recommend this course enough. Everything everyone says about Professor Merseth and the class environment she creates is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRUE. This was the best class I've taken at Harvard, I made some great friends in lecture and section, and most importantly, I learned a lot about the areas of our education system that desperately need improvement. Take this course\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou won't know what you're missing if you don't.","Taking this course should be a requirement for all students. It is a humbling experience that will force you to evaluate your values and purpose. If you want to leave class baffled in the best possible way, then take this course.","This course for me has been truly life-changing and eye-opening. I have always been interested in pursuing a career in education but this course has made this even more concrete for me. I greatly enjoyed gaining an insight into the history of US education and learning about the dilemmas and issues that still permeate the system today. Even if you aren't interested in a career in education, take this course. It will change your life.","The Q-guide and the selective lottery are not overhyped at all. I could sing of all of the praises about this course which deals with very relevent issues today, but it's not really necessary. There is a substantial amount of reading, but doing all of it helps you get more out of the course. Also, sign up for office hours as much as possible.","Something that Professor Merseth stated at the beginning of the class goes something like this, \"Education is the biggest civil rights issue of the 21st century.\" This class will show you exactly why that statement is probably the most valid you will hear during your time at Harvard. Education is tied to almost every other social and political structure the United States has today, and in order to understand our past, present, and future regarding equality, equity, and the well-being of our children, we MUST educate ourselves on the state of our education, and by discussing how we define excellence and equity is a very important first step in figuring out our own roles in this discussion.","US & World 35 is a gem in the General Education program that I would recommend to all students from various concentrations to take to enhance their awareness as a citizen of the inequities and aims for excellence in the American education system. It is a rare and invaluable experience to feel a part of an actual learning community that fosters communication with the professor, teaching fellows, course assistants, and peers.","do all the readings for sure! or you will look dumb","Professor Merseth is absolutely amazing - she works so hard to make this course what it is, and it shows. This class probably can't live up to the absurdly high expectations set for it, but it is definitely worth taking; I'm glad that I took it.","This class has one of the best Q-scores for a reason.  It has an amazing and dedicated teaching staff, insightful material, and thought-provoking debates and discussions.  It will challenge your beliefs and ideals in the best way possible.  No interest in education necessary, just a general interest in the social forces that shape U.S. society.","Take this course!!! If you're looking for a gen ed to fulfill this requirement, do it. If you have any interest in education, take this for the best overview and understanding of the most prevalent issues in the system. If you have any interest in anything in American society, take this because you need to have a working knowledge of the things we go through in this class--ranging from topics on charter schools to education policy--to function in society.","Best class ever.  If you lottery in, take it, and do all the readings.  You will learn so much about the American education system.  The lectures are incredibly engaging and I wish we had more time every lecture.  Prof. Merseth really cares about the students and the course, and it shows in how she runs the course.","Great class. Prof. Merseth is awesome -- really cares about the students. Interesting material. Sometimes essays are frustrating but other than that, fantastic.","Stop reading the comments. Lottery for this class. If you get in, take it. No excuses. It will change your life. You won't regret it.","Take this course. Lottery for it again and again. It will change the way you look at how you've been educated, why you've been educated, and what's wrong with the system and how to approach the solution. Kay Merseth isn't going to let you just sit in the back of the classroom passively though. She's going to know your name, she's going to use it, and she's going to ask you why you think the way you do. This class is run in such an interactive and purposeful way that you wonder why you haven't been taught this way your whole life. I've learned to think more critically about all the factors that play into my education, and every TF is so great that I've really improved both the way I argue and analyze as well as the way I write.","It is a great class and definitely caused me to question and reconsider some of my opinions and thoughts regarding the education system. The class makes me feel excited and more prepared for conversations I'm going to have with people over the next couple of years about the fragmentation of our education system and actually know what I am talking about. \n\nThat being said, be prepared to spend a lot of time on this class. Kay also cold calls all of the time which can be uncomfortable.","This class isn't easy, but it will make you think about education in a way you haven't before. If you stay on top of the readings, engage in discussion (though you should be aware that not all comments are equally valuable), and do the work, this class can be a valuable formative experience.","This is an amazing class. Take this class if you are genuinely interested in education in any way. While it may not be easy, you will walk out of the class feeling like you've learned something of great value, and it gives you an incredible perspective on education in your own life and in the nation. Get ready for it to challenge some of your views, in the best way.","One of the best classes at Harvard. The TF, CA and Merseth are the best you'll find. No matter what you're concentration is this is a class you must take. It will make you question your beliefs on race, religion, money, opportunity, politics, and yourself. How has made you become who you are today? This previously cheesy question becomes very serious in USW 35 and you will be humbled by the end of the semester. Lottery this and you won't regret it.","Section was great, and TFs seemed to be carefully selected. My TF was not only well-prepared and well-versed in the material, but also unlike many other classes, actually a good teacher (may be a plus of getting people from the ed school who were former K-12 teachers themselves). The lecture itself was a little to discussion heavy for me, especially in a class that big. Because of the emphasis on discussion, we didn't spend that much time learning new material in class and I found this somewhat frustrating as I didn't feel like I learned enough during the semester. Be prepared for this, otherwise you may be a little disappointed.","This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. If you lottery in, you have to take it (they are making it bigger next year so your chances will be better!). Professor Merseth is truly passionate about the dilemmas of public education in the U.S. both today and back through history, and the level of discussion that she sparks in lecture is both powerful and direly important. The class reminded me of the incredible diversity we have here at this school, both in terms of background and thought, and showed me the beauty of forming opinions by taking in a diverse set of ideas and beliefs. This is one of the only Ged Eds I've taken here that has made me want to go out into the world and take action on something that I care about. Also, the teaching team is out of this world so if you do end up getting into the class, take advantage of the awesome TFs.","This course is incredibly interesting (especially if you like education!) and you learn a ton just in a short semester. Great to take if it fills your USW Gen-Ed, but expect more work\/engagement than a typical Gen-Ed course. There is a substantial amount of reading but it all mostly very interesting. The teaching staff is great, Prof. Merseth is amazing and so sweet, and they bring so much energy to the course week after week. My only negative experience with the course was the paper assignments and subsequent feedback we received by our TFs on these. I found it's very difficult to do well in this course (based on the way they grade) coming from someone who has a background and experience in education. Definitely take this course, maybe just Pass\/Fail!","Get to know Professor Merseth. She is an incredible woman who cares about her students. That is rare at Harvard. Take this course just for her.","Take it","I took this class as an elective, as a senior, and because I am interested in education. The teaching team is phenomenal. They care deeply that every student learns something and enjoys the experience. It is also an opportunity to get to know a passionate Professor (Kay Merseth) and supportive, challenging teaching team. You will learn about the historical origins of American education, the challenges faced in the past and today, and how issues of equity and excellence play out in education. If you want a USW or an elective that is interesting and inspiring, this is a great class. It is not easy to get an A on papers - even if you are the best writer in the world. They want you to \"show improvement\" a la expos and all. If you are looking for a flat A, this class might not be the best choice, but it certainly is more interesting than most others and so important to learn about. The class composition will shape the class - with enough passionate, engaged students, discussion can be outstanding. Without it, discussion might stagnate - leaving you to be frustrated or happily sitting on your computer in the back of the classroom. I would recommend this to students across grade levels but also recommend that you try to do some of the reading - you will learn more from the class than without it. \n\ntl;dr - the teaching team is phenomenal, material interesting and accessible, workload very minimal, and the students in the class influence lecture the most. definitely recommend.","Take this class. This is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is relevant to everyone, because we are all successful products of the education system but may not have thought about how our education system affects everyone in our nation. This class will cause you to question your educational experience and taken seriously the dilemmas of equity and excellence in our education system. I also believe that, as citizens, we should have an understanding of education reform policies and a stance on which levers of education reform are the most effective at maximizing both equity and excellence in our nation.","TAKE THIS COURSE. It is by far my favorite class at Harvard. You would never know it is a GenEd because you leave lecture twice a week with the chills. Kay is incredible. Just take it.","This course is truly amazing. Coming from an engineering background, this opened my eyes to the purpose of education, and the challenges that are faced in the United States Education System. The teaching staff is great, and more committed to the class than any I've been in before. Definitely take this course if you can, but also be aware that there is a lot of reading assigned, which is expected to be completed. Additionally, the essays are very involved. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.","Forget EC-10. Forget CS-50. Lottery for this course every semester, because it truly is a course that must be taken.","This class is one of the best at Harvard.  Professor Merseth and her teaching staff know what they're doing and execute class lectures, discussions, and sections with ease and passion.  The readings are difficult for a gen ed, and participation is a big part of this course, but the teaching team is understanding and helpful with people who are more shy and less likely to speak up in the large lecture setting.  The assignments and discourse, as well as the different activities completed in lecture and section were enlightening and interesting.  Lottery for this class if you're looking for a great gen ed that doesn't feel like a waste of your time!","The entire teaching team is truly invested in you as an individual, and this class is worth taking precisely because of that.","This class is absolutely amazing. The workload is a bit more than a regular gen ed class, but it's completely worth it. The topic is so interesting and complex, and I learned so much. Professor Merseth cares about each student, which just shows how much she cares about the class. Definitely take it if you have the chance!","It's amazing but a lot of work"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"61","response rate":"83.61","QCourseOverall":{"number":"US-WORLD 35","course_id":"2082","cat_num":"55027","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"10","5s":"37"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"US-WORLD 35","course_id":"2082","cat_num":"55027","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"24","4s":"12","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"US-WORLD 35","course_id":"2082","cat_num":"55027","1s":"1","2s":"29","3s":"12","4s":"3","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
