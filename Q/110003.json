Professor Levenson is very accessible outside of class and I enjoyed him in lecture. I think at times there is a bit of circuitous talking in class and its hard to know what the main points are.","If this class is offered again, definitely seize the opportunity to take it at all costs. Getting to know and learn from Professor Levenson was an absolute joy and privilege. Few professors actually take the effort to connect with his or her students on such a level, and Professor Levenson fostered a very close community among our classmates. The content was very interesting, too -- it's a rare opportunity to study Jewish theology and religion under such a brilliant, compassionate, and humorous man."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RELIGION 25","course_id":"11216","cat_num":"34366","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 25","course_id":"11216","cat_num":"34366","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RELIGION 25","course_id":"11216","cat_num":"34366","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
