I thought that four hours of screenings was difficult to do in one sitting, and I would only recommend the class to people with a genuine interest in the material.","\"Exploring Culture Through Film\" is a seductive title, and a seductive subject matter, but the course itself falls short of expectations.","The films are fantastic at showing the way that people view their own and other cultures.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is an anthropologist, or who is interested in film but has not taken any documentary \/ ethnographic film classes.","If students need structure, this may not be the course for them.  If they are  independently minded and interested in ethnographic film, this is a great course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.56","difficulty":"3.11","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"17","response rate":"52.94","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 189","course_id":"5235","cat_num":"9619","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 189","course_id":"5235","cat_num":"9619","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 189","course_id":"5235","cat_num":"9619","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
