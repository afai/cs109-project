'07":{"comments":["From what I have heard, teachers become better as they teach this class year after year - so be patient.

I really really like the completely applied section of statistics, and don't like math at all, so my comments here aren't really appropriate at all.","Be prepared to study long hours, and finding a study group really helps!","Be prepared to work very, very hard. So hard, that you feel like your temples are caving in on your eyeballs, possibly accompanied by panic attacks.","This is a very good class. It will be quite hard with a heavy workload, but you will learn a lot.","Great course to learn about the foundations of probability and statistics.","Since this is a required course, I don't know how important a recommendation is. That being said... taking it with Armin (and with Jen as a TA) made my transition to graduate work a much smoother one that I had expected. The course required a lot of work.. but I feel like I learned a lot.","you learn fundamentals, very important and well taught","Armin is a great teacher. I know some of the materials before but still appreciate relearning it from him. He encourages conceptual understanding of probability yet maintains strong mathematical ground.\r\ni feel like i learn a lot from it."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Start the homework early!","Practise and be prepared to do lots of work problems.  That helps with your understanding and grades.","It was my most difficult class this semester, but it was also my favorite class. Master's biostat students don't have to take this class but I would recommend it for them, especially those intending to go into a phd program at some point. It is a lot of work, but it's also not an unreasonable amount, and many of the problems are challenging and interesting to think about and work through. You should acquire more than a superficial understanding of probability theory from this course (but still a little superficial; that's what probability 2 is for). And while this is a somewhat difficult course for most people, remember that even if you don't get a very good grade that doesn't mean you're a bad person."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It is a good course if you don't have a solid background in probability.  However, if you are a Biostatistics PhD student and have a good background in probability, it is safe to skip this course.","I had already taken essentially the same class at another institution, but I still found it challenging and interesting. It is a thorough grounding in probability theory. Many of the homework problems from Casella & Berger are not difficult probabilistically, but rather require a lot of calculus \"tricks\" which are annoying. Our TAs helped us a lot with these. Also I recommend that everyone attend the section\/lab meeting since working the practice problems in groups is an excellent way to learn. In fact, I would almost say it is more important to go to the section meetings than the lectures.","The course in difficult, very importa and useful, but it is very time demanding.","Be perfect in your writing and steady in your studies.","The exams are challenging, but the course is really interesting. The TAs were a huge help and the professor was as nice as can be.","Only take this course if you have a solid math background."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"19","response rate":"78.95","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOSTAT 230","course_id":"409","cat_num":"6183","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOSTAT 230","course_id":"409","cat_num":"6183","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOSTAT 230","course_id":"409","cat_num":"6183","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"5"}},"success":true}
