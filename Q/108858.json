The only thing to be cautious of is getting pigeon-holed on a specific project because you're deciding very early on in the class and starting substantive work, so think about the early memos carefully.","As with all seminars, the other students have a big impact on the experience. But the texts and Professor Stampnitzky are great. You'll learn a ton and wind up asking some pretty provocative questions every week. The topic also allows for a huge range of research topics when the time comes to write your paper. The style of the course makes writing the paper really painless as well.","Spend time on the readings because they're gems.  Especially the early ones.  Always save time to revise papers.","I did not find this to be the most engaging junior tutorial. The readings and discussions were fine, but not lively or memorable. The layout is pretty good: weekly response papers to check in on how your paper is coming along, an extensive prospectus, a presentation, and then the junior paper. However, I was left thinking this was just an okay class, whereas because it was my junior tutorial, I really wanted to love it."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Class discussion was disorganized. Content varied in terms of interestingness and relevance.","This course wasn't a bad course, per se; I enjoyed some readings and many of our discussions, but I also don't feel that I necessarily got a lot out of it.","This course was very good for me because it allowed me to continue researching my thesis topic and introduced me to some very useful literatures and scholars.  However, I had some serious reservations with this course as well.  Our class was a smart and talkative group; however, Lisa is not a very good discussion leader.  She often interrupted, asked questions that killed discussion, and often did not dedicate the necessary time to discussion on the reading at all (preferring break out groups for paper discussion).  If you're a self-motivated person who has a good plan for the semester this class may offer a new perspective to explore, but if you're still dabbling then I would look somewhere where the teacher offers more guidance and a structured class experience."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.30","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"2.20","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ns","course_id":"4620","cat_num":"95758","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ns","course_id":"4620","cat_num":"95758","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-STD 98ns","course_id":"4620","cat_num":"95758","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
