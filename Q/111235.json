'07":{"comments":["If you love learning the Korean language, this is an excellent course.  If you are looking for an easy elective, your time is probably spent elsewhere, as it requires dedication to avoid frustration.","Be prepared to work hard and still do poorly if you are not a native speaker.  Class is fun, though.","This class is great!  It is fun and is a great way to practice and further learn Korean.  You will get ample practice through homework, essays, quizzes, as well as presentations.","Be prepared to learn a lot, but, especially if you are not a native speaker, to put in three times as much work as native\/\"heritage\" speakers as this course moves very quickly.","If you're enthusiastic about learning Korean, this class will really strengthen your writing skills and advance your knowledge of your Korean."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Ms. Kim is one of the best professors that I've ever had.","The teacher is great!"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Kim Seonsengnim is great! She facilitates discussions so easily and is a very fun individual. She genuinely cares for her students and she is always willing to help.","The class is really interesting. You do not only learn the language, but  also learn the culture by preparing presentations and reading related materials.","keep pace with the course; don't think about cramming"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Korean is the best language in the world. SSN Jung is awesome and you'll love Korean 130a!","Even students who grew up speaking Korean at home struggled with this class. The coursework is reasonable for a language class, but the lesson quizzes are significantly harder than previous levels of Korean. If you want to be challenged, this is the class for you. \r\n\r\nAlso, the content of the class itself focused heavily on traditional Korean culture, so if you are interested in modern Korean culture, you may have a hard time paying attention in class... that is, if you understand what is going on in class in the first place.","If Jung SSN is teaching it, run for the hills. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The jump between 120 and 130 was ridiculous. The tests are impossibly long and hard. We learned nothing. Literally, we spent several weeks on a story that talked about sorghum stalks, thatched roof houses, and reed flowers. Yeah, I don't know what those are in English, either.","How easy you will find this course will depend on your experience level coming in, but Jung SSN is very understanding and accommodating of all ability levels, which makes for a relatively stress-free class experience. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to improve their Korean.","I liked this class.  The preceptor was great and really nice.  This class was my least worrisome class and I felt like the assignments were reasonable and helped me to improve my Korean."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Korean is so much fun!","Try to keep up with the diary entry schedule. It was by far the most time-consuming part.","Korean is great and very under-appreciated! Continue taking Korean languages classes because they keep getting smaller and you learn more and more each year."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["The class material is a huge step up from Korean 120, but because of that, the learning environment is less encouraging and helpful for second-language-learners.","This course is much more difficult than Korean 120, so just be prepared to make much more effort in studying and preparing for this class.","THIS IS A GREAT CLASS. If you've already made it through years one and two of Korean, take this again because A) you get Jung SSN who is amazing amazing amazing and B) you might as well because you've learned a lot already and in 130 you'll learn so much. 130 is where you begin to practice lots of reading, writing, speaking, and debating, and striving to get closer to native proficiency.","Be prepared to study almost every day!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"6.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"KOREAN 130a","course_id":"880","cat_num":"2071","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"KOREAN 130a","course_id":"880","cat_num":"2071","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"KOREAN 130a","course_id":"880","cat_num":"2071","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
