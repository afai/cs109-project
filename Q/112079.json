'11":{"comments":["Review your Hindi before you take this class.","Learning Urdu-Hindi from Richard-ji is a pleasure as usual. He really takes the time to ensure that everyone can take something valuable away from the class.","Great way to continue with your learning of Hindi-Urdu.","This is a wonderful class with interesting readings and a great instructor.","Great course. The workload is manageable, class is fun, and you build your knowledge of more advanced grammatical structures in Hindi-Urdu.","If you are interested in continuing Hindi, this class is the clear next step. Richard is a great teacher who is clearly knowledgable and excited about imparting his love for Hindi to students; however, much of this class falls on you as the student - how much time you want to put into it largely determines how much you will get out of it. It's easy to coast, but in that case the class has very little output.","It is challenging but worthwhile.","Take this class! Richard is a great teacher.","Requires lots of time and commitment. Delacy is very helpful and understanding.","Professor Richard Delacey is the best person to learn Hindi from. The course is not only superb in the technical delivery of linguistic proficiency, it is also a lot of fun.","Richard-ji is awesome. Be prepared to lose part of your weekend and at least one week night to doing assignments for this course. It is totally worth it! Work with friend, and it'll be really fun. Visit Richard! He is a stress reliever and a motivator. He just wants you to succeed.","Be prepared to put in a lot of work. The more effort you put in beyond the required assignments, the better you're going to do."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["100% recommended given that A) Richard Delacy is teaching it and B) The time gets changed to later in the day.","This course is great! I learn so much every class and Richard ji is amazing. You should definitely take this course to improve in you ability to read and understand stories and to improve in grammar and speaking.","Go to Delacy's office hours if you need help!","Professor Delacy is one of the most understanding and effective teachers at Harvard. He puts a lot of effort into making sure that his lessons are clear. However, second year Hindi-Urdu requires the consolidation of a lot of material as well as lot of time spent on fluency and practice. I would strongly suggest getting a textbook to supplement the assignments, because there is no assigned grammar guide and you will need one in order to effectively review the work that you have learned."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class helped me to read Hindi\/Urdu a lot better. Not only did it help me practice reading, but also understanding grammar constructions and appreciation for forms of poetry and prose. This is a great class that you must take if you want to continue language study in Hindi.","you will get out of it what you put into it"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is definitely a jump from Urdu 101 but, if you're up for it it is totally worth it and much more rewarding. You'll learn grammar that makes you sound extremely sophisticated and you'll be able read things and watch things that are extremely interesting."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Recognize that his year is not as relaxed as 101 and the pace definitely picks up! But once you understand that and prepare yourself, the course is amazing.","This is a great class in which you will learn the language at a great pace.  Small setting helps, and the Professor is very invested in his class!","Take initiative in this class. Richard ji is very chill and let's you take control over your own learning BUT you only get out as much as you put in.","This is the most amazing language course ever with the most amazing professor at Harvard. He is amazingly understanding and committed to helping you learn. He is also incredibly flexible in order to ensure that you actually learn the language.","If in doubt, take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HINDI-URDU 102","course_id":"4812","cat_num":"2941","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"URD 102","course_id":"4812","cat_num":"2941","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HINDI-URDU 102","course_id":"4812","cat_num":"2941","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
