A note of caution, however, that the reading load is very substantial (not unmanageable, however), so it might be best to have taken another 100-level course first.","As long as you are able to read Latin sufficiently well, this class is not to be missed.","The class is a lot of work, but if your Latin is up to it, I would heartily recommend taking it. Anyone interested in late antiquity or Christianity will greatly benefit from reading the first 9 Books of Augustine's Confessions in the original Latin. Dr. Stover highlights a lot of things about Augustine's neoplatonic intellectual formation that you'd otherwise miss. He also explains the intellectual world of late antiquity in a way that makes the narrative more comprehensible than if you were reading it on your own.","Be prepared to read a lot of Latin and do little else--even class consists mostly of translating, with the context and history coming out mainly as it becomes relevant. That said, it's exciting to read Augustine in the original."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.25","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.25","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MEDLATIN 106","course_id":"5015","cat_num":"21473","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MEDLATIN 106","course_id":"5015","cat_num":"21473","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MEDLATIN 106","course_id":"5015","cat_num":"21473","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
