It is a chance to engage with a topic of your choosing. The paper is difficult because you put it off until the last minute, but in the end it all works out. Jorgenson is an expert on the subject, so if you have any interest in Asia or development take this class!","It is a great class to learn and relax. The topic is fun the professor is really nice.","If you have never taken a seminar before, this course might require re-evaluating how you prepare for each class. A great portion of the class is devoted to discussion with your peers, and it becomes clear that those who have prior knowledge or keep up with current events will have more to say and be more knowledgeable overall. That said, it's unrealistic to expect everyone to know in-depth about every country, so picking an area or economic issue you are interested in and keeping up with it would be helpful.","This class is not well-structured. It begins with a few professor-led classes but then after that, it is all student presentations, which can be very difficult to stay focused and pay attention to. The only grades in the class are class participation, your presentation, and the final paper, and very little feedback\/structure is given regarding these three components, which can be very frustrating. The professor is nice and makes an effort to get to know all the students, but the class material is dense and repetitive, so I would not recommend the class overall.","Take it! You'll learn a lot. A wholly pleasant experience, as long as you stay on top of your paper. Professor Jorgenson is excellent.","This course was poorly designed. Discussion dissolved into a serious of googling to top articles about the concept being discussed. If you have no apparent previous experience with Asia your contributions are less valued in class. The atmosphere of the class is very unwelcoming and anxious. There was no guidance on assignments and often times one feels lost while moving through it.","This class is a great way to learn about the Asian growth story. Through a series of very interesting material, you learn an amazing amount about different perspectives and policies for growth. You get to compare different countries, and analyze events as they're happening. If you're at all interested the economic story of East Asia\/India, take this class. Professor Jorgenson is the warmest and most student oriented professor I've had the pleasure of learning from.","You should have to have extensive background in Asian economics (at least in one of the 3 major areas -- India, China, Japan) in order to be successful. The readings are more or less useless and the  professor is not the best at facilitating discussion. It might be worthwhile if you want a more relaxed (no weekly pset) economics class, but there is still a presentation and term paper. And you may walk away feeling like you learned nothing.","Professor Jorgenson only taught the first four courses of the year. Then 2 students each presented for 1 hour for the remainder of the classes for the semester. During the hour the student presented, they summarized the articles they read and led a discussion on a topic they were not well versed in. Professor Jorgenson kept track of class participation with a paper and pen on a chart that had everyone's pictures. The atmosphere of the class at times felt like students would zone out during the student presentations, but make random comments to ensure they received their class participation points. The culmination of the class is a 25 page paper, which is not an easy task. You should take this junior tutorial if you genuinely enjoy the subject material and you think you would enjoy researching and writing a mini-thesis style paper (25 pages).","Ec 980aa with Dale Jorgenson is a wonderful seminar, and I highly recommend it! It was this year's most popular Econ seminar for many reasons -- it covers an extremely important and pertinent topic in today's economy, it's a well-structured class, it balances the professor's lectures with lots of student participation and discussion, and it's taught by one of Harvard's most preeminent (and friendly!) professors.","This class was minimal week to week work. However, knowing what is going on in the class is essential to adding substantial points to weekly discussions. Professor Jorgensen is awesome, and don't hesitate to reach out and get advice for life, school, or the class itself.","Professor Jorgenson is awesome but you won't get much lecturing from him. Mostly presentation and discussion based, so not as engaged as it could be.","This was a fantastic class taught by an amazing professor. Unlike many distinguished professors, Professor Jorgenson does a fantastic job of getting to know each of the students in the seminar. He actively engages each of the students in a discussion setting during each class. Student presentations supplemented with stimulating discussions comprise the majority of the classes. Some students clearly have significant prior knowledge of Asia, but no background in the area is explicitly necessary."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a fun class with a relatively light workload but quite interesting subject matter. You'll get to learn about the latest Asian economic developments and discuss them in a fairly congenial setting. The paper is also a good opportunity to flex your research muscles, though think very carefully about data sources before you choose your topic.  Professor Jorgenson is one of the nicest professors in the Ec Department--go to his office hours!","This class can be chill with little time commitment if you want it to be. But both Professor Jorgenson and the TFs are wonderful resources and you can get so much out of the course beyond the lectures if you put in extra time and effort.","Jorgenson is great! You get to dine with him and his wife for class dinner. You get a lot of 1 on 1 time with the Professor.","Professor Jorgenson is very knowledgeable and I really enjoyed attending his lectures and the students' presentations. Having some prior knowledge regarding Asian economies is not a prerequisite, however, it is recommendable. Find the datasets you need for your paper early (!) in the semester, it will save you a lot of stress at the end. Do attend Professor Jorgenson's and Wentao's office hours regularly, it will help a lot!","If you are interested in Asian Economy, I'd highly recommend this course. Professor Jorgensen is a really great professor. He gives a lot of valuable feedback and tries his best to get to know every of his students. You will have to write a 25 page paper about a economic topic of choice and it helps a lot if you are already comfortable with STATA, but if you struggle with something you have some great resources available. This was for sure one of my favorite classes I had so far.","Dale is incredible. He makes himself available to students and is excited about the topic.","This a great course to learn about the growth of Asian economies, and learn how to conduct focused independent research.","I loved the course! Definitely got to apply a lot of the skills that I learned in earlier classes to the research paper in this class, which was really valuable since I was able to learn a lot during the process.","The class itself covers very interesting topics.  You will leave this class with a solid understanding of Asian markets and the global economy.  It is not overly difficult every week as the only graded assignments are a presentation and a final paper, but those two assignments are difficult.  There is a lot of support from the teaching staff, and you will be prepared for the final paper.  If you are thinking of writing a thesis, this class will be helpful.  Professor Jorgenson does a great job of meeting with students and even takes us out to dinner.  The class itself is tough, but you will learn a lot about the topics.","I recommend this course very much. The insights that Professor Jorgenson offers in class about the economic issues in China, India, and Japan are very interesting and relevant to the current state of the world economy. Final paper and student presentation are also two large parts of this course, and if you seek guidance during the course of the semester, the experience will become even more rewarding."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 980aa","course_id":"11296","cat_num":"70805","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 980aa","course_id":"11296","cat_num":"70805","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"11","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 980aa","course_id":"11296","cat_num":"70805","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
