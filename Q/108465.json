Several chem majors I know who took Chem 160 instead said that by the end of that course they were longing for a more mathematical treatment of quantum, though of course others like 160's more chemical approach. Math majors who take quantum tend to have a more applied math or physical approach anyway, and they tend to do really well.","Quantum mechanics is a beautiful theory that all should learn.","quantum is awesome material, the professor is awesome, it's a pain to learn it, though.","I truly enjoyed quantum mechanics I, for the material, the smaller class size and discussions, and the amount that I learned about general physics from Professor Doyle and the TF, Jacob.","Very interesting material, but depends a lot on who's teaching it","only take as a requirement or if you want to pursue physics."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["DEMLER IS A TERRIBLE TEACHER.

When I took this class, the teaching was so bad that I would rather have had no teacher and instead been told outright that I'd have to teach myself, instead of wasting my time expecting to be taught.  So I had a really rough time and was very disappointed to find myself struggling to understand both the concepts and the practical applications.  Keep up with the work diligently and try not to take this class until the professor is better.  If you do, GO TO SECTION religiously, because Jacob actually teaches well, and that's your one chance to learn from someone other than a book.","I have heard many physics students enjoyed QM when they took it.

It's an excellent class.","Quantum mechanics is absolutely amazing. You must take this if you are a physics concentrator! Especially if Gabrielse is teaching it!","I would recommend this course, but only for physics concentrators, for whom this is irrelevant because it is required. For people merely interested in physics it is probably too much work and too difficult a course to be a worthwhile elective. However, going through a quantum mechanics course is a great experience for anyone, especially physics concentrators.","This is an important class. It goes quickly, since there's a lot of material and it's taught in the shortened spring. Although by next year spring won't be shortened...","The material is fascinating, and explains a lot of the fundamental concepts in physics.","This class will test you, but towards the end of the semester, when everything starts to come together, it's totally worth it."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Very challenging but not impossible.  Gabrielse is a great professor.","Gabrielse is a great teacher- he's good at summarizing main points, and he's very dedicated to helping his students not only learn the material but actually do well (grade-wise) in the class. Expect to invest a good amount of time in reading various textbooks (Griffiths and Sakurai) on your own, though. Finally, the only way to really learn is to do problems!! Take psets seriously- they are a huge help.","I enjoyed this class, even though it was difficult and introduced a lot of new concepts.","Professor Gabrielse is an excellent professor. He knows how to teach in a way that makes material very to learn. He understands students and there learning styles well. Quantum mechanics is also a very exciting part of physics - very useful as well. I also love how Quantum mechanics uses to language of linear algebra.","Take it... Just take it...","I would tell them to read the material before lecture.  I think it helps a lot.","solid class","There is a very large range of student performance in the class","This is important stuff; people should have an idea of how particles behave at a fundamental level.","Take it, even if you're not a physics concentrator.  Amazing class.","Do not be intimidated by the course name. This is the best class you will take in physics at Harvard","Difficult, but really worth it if you put in the time and effort.  It does take time.","It was good to take with Professor Gabrielse, and I thought that it was a good introduction to Quantum Mechanics. It was probably the best physics class I have taken at Harvard.","Quantum mechanics is a fascinating subject!  I highly recommend this course to students who are serious about physics.","This course really made me love physics. The course covers a lot of cool concepts and a lot of sources from which to get help with the more difficult concepts. Jerry Gabrielse is also an incredibly awesome professor.","This class is very difficult, but also very worthwhile.  Be prepared to work hard.","This is a good introductory quantum class. It is not difficult or particularly time-consuming (except one or two psets), but it builds good intuition and is well-taught. The great professor is a huge plus.","Fantastic introduction to quantum mechanics. A very complete and elegant course.","Let me first emphasize that this is a very good class, and is well worth taking.  \r\nThe subject material is very interesting, but don't get your hopes up impossibly high.  I had heard so much about \"...quantum mechanics...\" and how cool it was; I expected to walk into class and suddenly understand...EVERYTHING!  But no such luck...QM is not a cure-all, and in practice it turns out to be mostly a bunch of integrals and linear algebra (not to say that's bad, I really do like linear algebra).  The results of all this work are very cool, though, in particular when you start explaining all the chemistry stuff you thought you knew back in high school but didn't really understand.  You will understand the hydrogen atom very well.\r\nThis is actually a very good class, and I ended up really enjoying it once I got past the first week's disappointment.  I strongly recommend that you take it if you are at all interested.","- wicked awesome","Quantum mechanics is very, very hard. It is extremely time-consuming. That said, taking this class with Jerry was a great idea.","Quantum mechanics is awesome. This course was hard, but incredibly rewarding.","Prof. Gabrielse and the teaching staff were great ... definitely the best physics course I've had so far.  You'll learn a lot.","Do the readings ahead of time, start the problem sets immediately, and do extra problems whenever possible.","Intro to quantum mechanics.  Bad-ass, useful, important.","Devote to it the time you need. It's fantastic. Make friends because you're going to want shoulders to cry on but it's really worthwhile in the end."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This course is challenging, but can be very rewarding. Professor Feldman can be a confusing lecturer, so make sure to read the textbook.","You might want to take this course with another lecturer because Prof Feldman was a little boring at times.","I repeat what I said in the first box.","Really fascinating material if you like physics. The exams and problem sets are really well done by Feldman. You'll be amazed that these crazy equations describe the world","Only take this class if you have to and probably take it with a different professor.","The material in this class is undoubtedly very interesting. However, I felt that I learned the most in section as opposed to lecture. The professor didn't always engage the students and tended to read off his notes directly and transcribe them on the board as his method of teaching. Additionally, at the beginning of every class, he would start exactly where he left off without really going over previous concepts to make sure we remembered them - that made the lectures hard to follow a lot of times. Generally, his style of teaching isn't captivating and can make you easily lose interest.\r\n\r\nSection, on the other hand, was more involved, and extremely useful. Vivek went over a lot of examples and was very helpful in solving people's problems and answering doubts. The section handouts condense the important lecture material down into one or two pages and they're handy as review guides. So generally, if you have Vivek as your TF you'll be fine, but the professor alone isn't enough to learn the material well.","Necessary for physics. Try to take it without Feldman.","This class was kind of fun in a weird way. It's hard to stay on top of the material, but read Griffith's along with the lectures if you can. And give yourself more than one night to study for the Final Exam...","The Prof. Feldman - Vivek combination works well; the material is interesting; be prepared to put in the work otherwise things won't make sense at all. Use Griffiths a lot.","It is what it says it is, presentation of quantum mechanics, following Griffiths closely.","Extremely difficult subject, don't take it if you don't plan on using quantum again in the future.  Feldman's lecture notes are really useful and well done, but he can't keep your attention\/keep you awake in lecture, so it might be more productive to just download the notes.","This is a good class if you have the physics and math background. The teaching style and exam format Prof. Feldman uses are good if he's teaching it again.","It's really hard!  There are people in this class who get 100% while others struggle just to barely understand the concepts.  Not sure where the smart ones are getting their information, but they seem to know information that wasn't covered in class but appears on psets.","Everyone should learn quantum mechanics, it's simply one of those extremely rewarding experiences.","A very important class.  Professor Feldman's lectures can drag at times, but he is a great teacher.  Problem sets were very good too.  The only potential downside is that it may be more efficient to just read Griffiths (assuming you don't have to take the course for concentration credit).  Great course on the whole!","The class could be better organized and lectures could definitely be stronger, but evaluation is very fair, and the material is very interesting. For people interested in physics, quantum mechanics is pretty essential, so I would recommend the course. For people considering taking Chem 160 instead, Physics 143a is very manageable if you have a fairly strong math\/physics background, so I would again recommend this course.","I really enjoyed the subject. The latter half of the course was (and still is even after the final) hazy, but still interesting. To succeed, you need to stay on top of the material, and do as much practice as possible (bet you already knew that).","I was extremely excited to take 143a based on what I had heard about the way Professors Gabrielse and Vafa taught the class in the past. I was sorely disappointed. Professor Feldman was frankly not up to the task of teaching this class. His lectures were uninspiring and often confusing. He made no effort to make the course material coherent, and seemed pretty disinterested in whether we actually learned anything from the class. I made it through this class pretty much only because the Griffiths textbook is excellent and because Vivek worked very hard to try to catch everyone up on the course material. Nonetheless, it was a pretty miserable experience.","This class is really interesting and a lot of fun. Quantum mechanics is just really cool.","I would tell them to take this course when it is taught by another professor. After reading about how great the two previous professors who taught this class were, I was very disappointed with the way the class was taught. I found myself not finding the lectures too helpful, but Vivek, my tf, was really helpful."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["A wonderful professor, and very interesting material. However, I somewhat disliked the textbook.","With Vafa, this class really varies in difficulty. He takes a pretty theoretical approach. I would recommend getting Griffiths just to have 2nd reference and more examples to go through. \r\nThere just weren't enough examples in the lectures or in Liboff. \r\nInteresting material though.","Make sure you are good at math.  This should be a math-intensive course for physics students, but ends up being a physics-heavy course for math students.","This class was the first time that I really enjoyed physics. The material is really elegant, if not always very physical.","The class with Prof. Vafa covers a lot of material very quickly. It is more mathematical and abstract than I feel a typical course is. It is also graded very, very harshly.","This class is really hard, but amazing. Vafa gives great lectures, but getting a good grade is hard.","Prof. Vafa teaches this very mathematically. There are not too many examples and the course was difficult, but I felt like I gained a very solid understanding of quantum. I believe we covered almost the entire textbook and I feel very prepared for future classes. Do know that the exam questions often approached the material from a different angle than straightforward textbook questions and required a very thorough and fundamental understanding of the material. It's not easy but I'd recommend the class","Know linear algebra and make sure you have a study group for the homework sets. I also found the class to be pretty theoretical.","The course is fairly demanding","The professor is a great lecturer who will really fascinate you with the exploration of the subject, but you must be ready to commit plenty of time and consult outside sources (a different textbook, for example) for a solid understanding of such a non-intuitive subject. Don't miss any lectures or sections!","Introduction to quantum mechanics is imperative and extremely interesting! Take this class prepared for lots of studying but satisfaction in knowing the material by the end of the class.","Quantum mechanics is awesome, and this class is a good way to begin the long and sometime arduous process of trying to understand QM. Prof. Vafa is a good lecturer, although his approach to the topic will probably seem to math-heavy to some and not rigorous enough to others. The class is very challenging, but I personally enjoyed it a lot.","I'd recommend it because the material is interesting, but the homework can be somewhat unpleasant.","If you are seriously interested in understanding the basic workings of the universe, take this class.   Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time on problem sets as the subject material isn't exactly intuitive.","Wait for different teaching staff and a different textbook. The course under these staff was unfulfilling and undesirable. I have heard that the course was far better in other years; the textbook and website from previous years strongly suggest this.","Vafa is an amazing quantum lecturer. He makes it really easy and exciting. Problem sets are straightforward, but I suggest reading Griffiths for a supplement.","Tough, abstracts, enigmatic.","I thought I learned a lot during this class--quantum mechanics is a really interesting subject.  It's often hard to get an intuitive understanding of what's going on, but overall one should definitely take this class.","Very harshly graded","Watch out if Vafa is teaching this course.  He is a skilled lecturer indeed, but he has no sense of pace.  He goes quickly to beign with, which is fine, but if even a few students complain that the pace of a particular part of the course (say the review of math that only some of the students in the class have seen before,) he'll pick up the pace even more and never slow down again.","It's an absolutely wonderful subject, and I would take this class again, but I think the way the class was this year had a lot of problems, which I hope will be different in subsequent years.\r\nBuy a copy of griffiths even if it's not the official text book. You'll need it.","This class is awesome, but it's a big time commitment.  Work hard and enjoy all the physics you're learning, and you'll have a great time.","One of the hardest and most stressful classes Ive ever taken.","Avoid taking this course with Vafa at all costs. Make sure you have done linear algebra at the level of Math 23 or equivalent.","A solid course in quantum mechanics. I entered with only physics 16 background, being a math major, and it was more or less fine -- there were a few E&M and waves facts that I didn't know, but otherwise I managed fine. Problem sets and tests were rather computational. Professor Vafa is a good, engaging lecturer.","Quantum mechanics is an interesting, peculiar, and engaging subject, if the work is at times tedious. Be sure to think about it! And don't slack off.","Be prepared to have to do a lot of messy computation on homework sets.","This class is very difficult. Prof Vafa is a great lecturer but there is a bit of a discontinuity between the problem sets, lectures, and exams. Psets are difficult and sometimes not useful in learning the concepts, lectures are interesting but sometimes it is difficult to discern what material is most important. Exams were fair and tested the key concepts appropriately."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Gabrielse's version of 143a is much more manageable and less mathematically demanding (though perhaps also less satisfying) than when it is taught by other professors.  Quantum mechanics is a fascinating and useful subject, and I definitely enjoyed it much more than 15b and 15c.","This professor\/TF dynamic is the way to do it from what I've heard elsewhere on the Q, and I agree.  I hear this is the least math-y way to go, and there was a bunch of math, soooo if you're interested more in physics this is best since the other professors must really have a ton of math.","The lectures and book (Griffiths) together cover the key concepts about as well as could be hoped for.  The professor is accessible and dedicated, but there's something of a disconnect between lectures, problem sets, and tests.","Let's face it: QM is insane and unintuitive at times, and that makes it difficult, but it's always fun and strange and exciting! If the class has a professor that teaches it well (Gerry Gabrielse was mine), then you will not regret the ride.","Prof Gabrielse is the best Professor I have had at Harvard and Girma is the best TF I have had at Harvard. They REALLY know how to explain QM. If you are willing to put enough efforts, I'm sure you will learn a whole lot from this class, because there is always someone(both prof Gabrielse and Girma are very easy to meet for discussions) who can pinpoint the essence of your problem when you get lost on something.","This is a fascinating class. Gabrielse was a great teacher, and he really did care about the students. Unfortunately, he also cares about lots of other things and had to cancel\/reschedule class multiple times, as well as being reliable in his unreliability at posting psets and practice exams. If you need someone very organized, I would not recommend taking the course with him, but otherwise I recommend it.","The class is taught very well, and introduces an extremely important field with a good grounding in both mathematical and physical reasoning. It's an extremely valuable experience.","I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in understanding how the universe really works. A significant proportion of such students are physics concentrators, but the class is also fairly harmless for students without much background. Univariate calculus is adequate preparation, despite what the Department might tell you.\r\n\r\nGabrielse, Girma, and David J. Griffiths are a good teaching trio. Lectures are clear to the point of being slow, section is generally helpful, and the book is fantastic. The nature of quantum mechanics, however, is such that you will not understand everything the first time around. Understanding is built by doing problems, and that is where this class is seriously flawed.\r\n\r\nBased on my experience, it is reasonable to expect perfect scores and no feedback on the weekly problem sets, even if you have actually done entire problems wrong. This may be a good recipe to make happy students in the short run, but it's ultimately damaging to those who'd like to continue in physics. It's also worth nothing that half of the 'problems' on a typical assignment essentially ask you to transcribe a derivation or example out of the book, which doesn't add anything to the course that you couldn't have gotten by just doing the reading. Tests -- the first one in particular -- are also bizarre. Twenty questions (of wildly different difficulty but all worth five points) that ask you to simply write down an equation or integral? (Four of those twenty might have literally the same answer, too.) Not so much an assessment of physics as of test-taking skills. The emphasis on making students happy with high grades (also demonstrated by the test-corrections policy) does seem to come at the expense of understanding the material, which is very unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThis set of teaching staff could be awesome if the assignments and assessments were overhauled and actually graded.","If you're a physics concentrator, you have no choice ... but if you're deciding between Chem 160 and Physics 143a (for CPB, for example) then seriously consider Chem 160. While 143a seems to be \"intense\" and \"well-taught\" at first, it was a poorly organized class with poorly written exams and problem sets that often covered material never covered in section or lecture. If quantum is not a requirement for your concentration and you want to learn quantum mechanics, you might just consider reading Griffiths - it's a great textbook, and was clearer and more helpful than lectures or section.","This is an integral course in the education of any physicist! It will show you how intricately physics and mathematics are linked, and also hopefully teach you how to distinguish the two. The class could potentially be lackluster depending on the teaching staff, but a good textbook like Griffiths can help get you through the course.","Gerry Gabrielse was an excellent teacher and I highly recommend taking the course with him. Girma Hailu was an outstanding TF who brought both passion and a strong understanding of the course material to benefit the class.","Quantum is awesome.  Even if you're not a physics concentrator, I would recommend taking it, because it will change the way you see the world.  It's a lot of work but worth it-- practice will definitely improve your skills, and you can apply your problem-solving techniques to any problems you may encounter in life.  I feel like a smarter person after having taken this class.","The class material was interesting and was taught really well. Gabrielse is a great lecturer, conveys tough material in an accessible way, and truly cares about making sure everyone understands what is going in class. Girma is very enthusiastic about the material and does a really nice job of explaining the physics behind the math thereby making section and office hours really helpful and enjoyable.","This is by far the best\/most interesting physics course.  If you can, take it with Professor Gabrielse, whose problem sets and midterms are totally reasonable."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Doyle is one of the best teachers I've had at Harvard. He may be a little bit stern at times (who cares) but he is both funny and extremely committed to making people understand the material. That said, I urge you to read your textbook as the course goes along...you'll find that sometimes (even though Doyle is a great lecturer) you'll uinderstand better that way.\r\n\r\nMy regrets about the course: (1) exams and the like were highly computational and didn't require much understanding. this made them hard for the wrong reasons and skews grading, etc. (2) I feel like my conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics is still pretty lousy after this class -- David played a huge role in trying to counter this, but lecture itself was not useful on this front.  Sometimes it felt like in the first half we were just solving the schrodinger equation again and again with new boundary conditions and in the second half we were just doing the same thing with more algebraic machinery. \r\n\r\nTake this class!","read griffiths religiously","Doyle is tough, and so is the class, but it's very rewarding and interesting. Not that this comment matters, because if you are thinking about taking this, you most likely have to take it for your concentration.","Be ready to work, but this will be the best class you ever take.","Quantum mechanics has been the first physics course I have truly enjoyed. (Others were good, but this has been the best so far.) You will need to put in some time, most likely. Learn to use Mathematica, it is really helpful.","QM is cool, and necessary, and not really that crazy (sometimes) if you just step back. I didn't really agree with some aspects of Prof Doyle's teaching style, but he is a pretty good lecturer, and is enthusiastic.","This is a very, very hard class. Unless you're a math\/physics whiz, you should take it pass-fail.","I had a pretty frustrating experience with this class. Despite strong efforts on my part to succeed, I ultimately felt very unsupported and lost. I would recommend that you try to be as self-aware as possible before you get too deep into this class as to whether or not you are truly ready to take this class for a letter grade, pass\/fail, or even at all. I definitely should have taken it pass\/fail, I think, but I didn't realize that until it was too late. It's too bad, because I love the material! Professor Doyle is a brutal grader though and can come across as a bit harsh in class.","This is a hard class.  It's also my favorite class I've ever taken.  Prepare to be confused, then finally gain a small inkling of understanding at the end. Also, I've heard that it doesn't really all sink in til 143b.","Quantum mechanics is so critical to developing a well-informed sense of reality. The material blew my mind, and I'm thrilled to be somewhat competent now in the basics of this field. Doyle was really dedicated in his lectures. I particularly enjoyed how many times this semester he said \"I am trying to educate you\" and \"I am omitting this because it is not useful for your education\". It shows that he cares about how to actually teach well and not just about the actual material, and he also dedicated a huge amount of time answering student questions each lecture. But MY GOD WAS HE TOUGH!!! The grading in this course is cutthroat, watch out.","By all means, take Physics 143a if you have any inkling of interest in quantum mechanics, which is sometimes very counter-intuitive but also extremely elegant and just plain awesome. Doyle was a fine professor, Benjamin was a great TF, and Griffiths was an excellent textbook, so overall the course was great this year. That said, the problem sets were sometimes very tedious, and the final exam was surprisingly difficult given the level of the problem sets and the (relatively easy) midterm. Take the course, by all means, since quantum mechanics is absolutely fundamental to a more complete understanding of the universe in general, but be wary of the exams.","It's tough, but it'll move 'Quantum Mechanics' from the realm of magic to the realm of reality and practicality.","As with all physics classes, it depends on the teacher. If you don't care about having absurdly difficult exams that will definitely kill you grade, then take this class with Doyle, because if it grades didn't matter this would probably one of my favorite classes. However, they do matter and his exceedingly harsh exams upset me. Nevertheless, I left happy having learned A LOT. This class is great for learning. The TF, David Benjamin, was soo good!! If you can have him, you're set.","it's a fascinating class. if the professor TF are john doyle and david benjamin, they're wonderful, thoroughly dedicated to teaching and pedagogy, and presenting the material faithfully but accessibly. it's a great class and if you have the math for it, definitely take it. if you don't you'll have to work hard, but it's conceptually brilliant and gives you an understanding of quantum that you'd be lacking without the quantitive side. taking it pass\/fail is... both rewarding and unrewarding. you'll probably find yourself quickly lost within the complicated perturbation theory if you don't keep up from week to week. that said, it's still rewarding because you gain a good grasp of the material.","Professor Doyle is a great teacher.  He's clear with everything and makes sure to answer questions when they're applicable.  This class is also nice in that there aren't really that many prerequisites that you can't just pick up as you go.  For example, it says you need 15c but there really isn't anything that you can't deal with as long as you know the math behind it.","Doyle's treatment closely follows Griffiths, which is an excellent textbook. The first half of the course, which covers the theory of 1D wave mechanics and formalism, is very well-taught. The second half, which focuses on solving the hydrogen atom with various effects, is more messy. Overall, it's a great introduction to quantum.","Prof. Doyle was engaging and clear.  The Griffiths textbook is excellent (seriously).  If it's something you want to learn about, go for it.","Stay on top of your work.  You learn how to solve a number of different types of problems throughout the course and if you fall behind, it will be very difficult to catch back up.","Doyle's a lot of fun, but if you don't want to hurt your GPA you're better off taking this class with anyone else.","Wait for someone else who cares about his or her students and cares about testing you in a way that is meaningful instead of arbitrary.  Prof Doyle's tests are under extreme time pressure and select for people that excel in that testing environment.  Further they rely on tedious calculations under time pressure.  If you are good at that then this class will be a breeze.  If not, wait a semester, because you will come out very discouraged\/down on yourself, and that kind of experience can be scarring academically and intellectually.","143A was the most interesting physics class I took at Harvard. Although the material is difficult, it's fascinating. I wouldn't take it for a letter grade unless you're prepared to invest a tremendous amount of time.","it's a great class - as long as you can stay on top of the readings, you'll be fine.","Be prepared to invest a lot of time into this class and not understand everything that is taught."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This course is really dependent on you learning a lot on your own.  I found that I could only really follow lectures if i had read the chapter thoroughly before.","Quantum is something that I think most people should study. I still do not understand the concepts behind the math very well, but then again, I don't think it's possible to actually ever achieve an understanding of quantum. That being said, a basic understanding of what measurement uncertainty is a good thing to have, and the math is not hard. Your experience in this course will likely depend a lot of which professor is teaching it. For example, this semester, we spent more than a month on chapter 4 (angular momentum and spin), which was nice because this is a very conceptually difficult area of quantum, but this also caused us to not see as many applications such as perturbation theory and the variational principle...","Although the course does it at a low level to make things not absurdly difficult, this material taught is the hardest intrinsically of any course I have taken. Prepare to be reduced to blindly pushing symbols and not really understanding anything.","Griffith's, the textbook, is an extremely well-made textbook; David, the TF, genuinely wants everybody to learn, and he spends a great deal of time trying to help everybody get better.  However, the lectures were extremely confusing and did almost nothing to further my knowledge of the material.  You are going to have to rely almost exclusively on the textbook.","If Demler is teaching it, it's worth waiting the semester. He has a tough time gauging the ability of the students and doesn't cater well to any level but the highest of students.","The class is difficult.  It is, after all, quantum physics.  Manageable, but go into it planning to dedicate plenty of time outside of the problem sets to just thinking about the concepts, as a lot of them will give you headaches for weeks before you get used to them.","Honestly, now that it's over and I can relax and think about it without fearing for my life, it has been a pretty decent time. Unfortunately, when you're caught up in the middle with absolutely no idea of what's going on or how to drag yourself out of this mess, it becomes slightly more than frustrating, especially because most of the learning this semester emerged from Griffiths rather than the lecture room.","I would heavily advise against taking this course with Prof Eugene Demler, and those who do take it should remember that they were warned. Prof Demler knows his material and is very intelligent, he also admits that he loves to teach, but it does not mean that he is the best at it. Quantum Mechanics is supposed to be one of the most crucial topics in physics, and, yet, this course was one of the most miserable experiences I have had at Harvard. I learnt nothing from class and had to resort to the book and friends' help in order to understand the material. Students stopped showing up to lecture only a few weeks into the course as they realised lectures were an absolute waste of time. Section turnout was also pathetic since sections were ineffective. Honestly, I cannot say it any clearer but if Prof Demler is teaching this course then save yourself the trouble, listen to a fellow student's advice, and avoid taking it while you can.","Its quantum mechanics, you can't go wrong.  Its interesting subject material you probably don't know already and a nice marriage of algebra and calculus (though luckily more nice algebra than messy calculus).  Don't be alarmed that you will probably do your entire first few psets in mathematica - that will change as time goes on.  But don't become dependent on mathematica to do you integrals because you'll have to do them by hand on the exams.  Overall, great class.","Course teaches a thorough basic understanding of quantum, but the math necessary is much greater than the 15 series.  The concepts are not as intuitive.","PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS: Do not ever, under any circumstances, take a class \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taught\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by Professor Demler (unless you are a masochist).\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION: Do not ever, under any circumstances, allow Professor Demler to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teach\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an undergraduate class that is required for Physics or Chemistry and Physics concentrators. I encourage you to put him where he will do the least damage. If he teaches the course in the future, someone would be wise to organize a peaceful protest with a poster highlighting his Q scores and evaluations, and hand out hard copies of his scores and select evaluations to students during shopping period.\r\n\r\nEVERYONE: I feel that I was cheated out of an opportunity to learn quantum mechanics. A course should be more than just deadlines to make you teach yourself. My experience with this course reminded me of some scenes in The Dark Knight Rises. There is a prison camp underground and every once in a while, one of the prisoners tries to climb out, but no one has ever made it before. It took batman three tries to do it, but eventually he got out. I was a prisoner in this camp. I tried to climb out. I tried again to climb out. Then I saw batman climb out and felt even more discouraged and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even try to climb out after that.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the course, the date of the midterm was not in the syllabus. Demler finally picked a date for the exam and gave us two weeks notice. First of all, two weeks notice is not fair considering other courses have exam dates determined before the semester even started. Second, there were four (4) problem sets worth of material before the exam. The first two were returned to us before the midterm, solutions were merely posted for the third, but we had absolutely no feedback on the fourth problem set. Two of the five questions on the exam were related to material on the fourth problem set. That is simply not fair, and from that point on, it became clear that we were on our own; we had to teach ourselves quantum mechanics. We could not count on a course to help us learn, all the course did was discourage and demoralize. After inquiring with the TF about having a second midterm, it seemed that our ideas on how to improve the course were trivial. They said there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough time in the course. (Begin tangent argument: Since no one went to class after the midterm, there was plenty of time for another exam. Also, if you think cramming chapter 6 into three days at the end of the course is a good idea, then cramming it into two days should be a better idea. End tangent argument.) That should be a huge red flag for any professor: Why would a subset of the class ASK for ANOTHER EXAM? Was it because we are masochists? Certainly not! We wanted to learn! We got into Harvard in the first place because we love learning.\r\n\r\nWe were informed that the final exam was not cumulative only two before the exam. When it comes time for the final exam in a class like this, it is necessary to pick certain topics to study, since it is unreasonable to try to teach yourself the entire course in a week. I spent time studying material from before the midterm and then gave up entirely when I read that email: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, you studied stuff from the beginning of the course? Good for you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the exam. You wasted your time when you had none to spare.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d At the beginning of the course, the TF said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This course is like the marines. We will tear you down, then build you up stronger than you were before.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He lived up to the part where he said he would tear us down. Demler couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to send the class an email, so he just had the TF email us all the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He cares about teaching,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the TF says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wants to develop his teaching skills.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Please. First, try communicating with your students yourself. Second, I wanted to develop my quantum mechanics skills, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get another chance to do that.","QM is really weird- be prepared to work a lot and study a lot for this course or you won't get enough out of it. Your experience depends on what teaching staff you have, but Griffiths is a great book so even if it's a bad teacher you should be OK. However, Demler and David were both awesome this term, and any of the slight frustrations or mishaps that I had with the course will surely be resolved by the next time Demler teaches it, and Im sure that it will be an even greater course then! Also Demler really cares about his students, and he has greatly improved since the last time he taught this course, so the scores from then shouldnt scare you- he's pretty good now!","This course is not well engineered for undergraduate students.  I have not been more disappointed in a class in my entire time at Harvard.  If you have to take this class then I would *strongly* recommend taking it pass\/fail because even if you feel comfortable with the material your grade might not well reflect this.  It might be better to take further classical mechanics before taking this course.  In general, this class really turned me off of physics and although I am still very passionate about the subject I will approach my future class selections with much more trepidation.  \r\nThis class is difficult, it takes a lot of time, no one seems to know what is going on and it is oftentimes poorly organized (they didn't tell us about the date of our midterm that counted for a *lot* of our grade until way into the semester).  I did not find this class to be fair and I would not recommend it.","Take quantum!! It is so fundamental to how the universe works. Don't miss the opportunity.","The material is very cool.","Quantum is awesome! You'll learn more of what it's like to be a real physicist. Definitely recommended for anyone with an interest in physics, not just concentrators (I'm not in physics and I loved it).","Do not take this class if Professor Demler is teaching it.  The problem sets were manageable, but the final contained things I had never seen before.  Perhaps these are things I would have seen before had the class been taught by a good professor.  He was out of touch with undergraduates and their needs for learning a difficult, fundamental topic.","The quality of the course will depend on the professor, but David Benjamin is great. Read Griffiths and do the problems.","You think Schrodinger's cat is trippy? Learning the rest of quantum is awesomer. Some of the material in 143a is a bit dry, seeing as it's introducing lots of basic things and methodology (I keep hearing that 143b is cooler), but overall the stuff is really neat, and in many ways very different from any classical physics you've done before. Prof. Demler's all right: very nice and into teaching, usually explains things sufficiently, but sometimes lectures felt unmotivated or unnecessarily bogged down by nasty math we could've simply read up on in Griffiths. And David Benjamin is the best TF ever: informative, enthusiastic, highly amusing, helpful, everything.","The material is fascinating. It is also very remote from what you've learned in your previous physics classes - perhaps surprisingly. The class is rather mathematical, and in particular relies heavily on linear algebra. But it is extremely worth taking. The perspective it adopts - and gives - on the subject matter and scope of physics is not to be missed.","Very interesting, very difficult. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on problems sets, reading the textbook, and studying.","This course was pretty difficult. The material was taught very theoretically and I felt that I never really learned how to do the problems on the midterm and final. The material can be interesting, and probably a lot of fun if you're comfortable with your linear algebra.","I would very hesitantly recommend this course; if Demler is teaching it, I might even say that you should wait for another semester.  His treatment of the material is typically opaque, and he does not seem able to understand how the material looks like to someone learning it for the first time.  He is fine, I think, if you are Math\/Phys. or of comparable level of comfort with Quantum mechanics before taking the course; however, I felt that it was really hard to understand the professor at the best of times."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class is a lot of tedious calculation work. Although it is clear this is necessary for understanding real physics, it would be nice to be able to use a calculator or a computer in performing calculations rather than purely doing them by hand.","The class itself (course structure, readings, problem sets, midterms) are excellent. HOWEVER, Professor Doyle is sometimes quite rude and lazy, and his final exam is a serious killer with a lot of unfamiliar material. Do not be fooled by the easiness of the problem sets and midterms! Overall, though, if you're interested in the material and know some physics, this is a good class. Quantum is really cool!","At first, everything will make sense. Then, a third of the way through, you will be hit by something called \"formalism\" and get very confused. Much of the difficulty of the course is seeing how the formalism encapsulates the early intuition, and makes it more powerful.","This course teaches you quantum mechanics. Looking at this from a physics perspective (as opposed to taking similar courses in other departments) helps to see all the subtleties and intricacies of quantum mechanics. Of course, there's still another semester of undergrad quantum mechanics to go (143b).\r\nTaking AM 105 (Differential equations) or an equivalent course before taking quantum is incredibly helpful. However, even taking them both at the same time is still very helpful, although you may struggle with the math at first if you haven't studies diff eqs before. And of course, make sure you are comfortable with linear algebra.","If you're a physics concentrator, you'll have to take the class anyway. If you're not, you need to be very interested in quantum mechanics to stay interested throughout. I personally enjoyed the course because it was a great formal introduction to quantum mechanics. Prof Doyle tends to give pretty calculation intensive questions, but I don't mind that because I think that's just part of \"doing\" physics (though I know many people who disagree).","If you are looking for an interesting application of linear algebra and an extension of your physics knowledge you should definitely consider taking this course.  Especially take it if Professor Doyle is teaching it.  He is the best lecturer I have had at Harvard by far and I walked out of every single physics lecture loving physics and intrigued by quantum mechanics.","Pretty interesting material. Doyle was a good lecturer, but followed Griffiths carefully for most of the semester. However, he was helpful in giving experimental motivation, which I cared about less than the abstract component of the course. Section was really excellent. The one caveat: if this class is with Doyle, then the exams are probably computational under time pressure. Some people are fine with this, but others struggle a bit. The tests are quite fair though.","Lectures were a bit slow at times and too computational, but relatively good class overall.","Honestly before coming into class I was very intimated by the comments of 15c and previous 143a (also taught by Professor Doyle). People say he is so harsh, exams are extremely difficult, etc. After taking taking the class, I found all this is entirely not true. Professor Doyle is a very wonderful professor giving effective lectures. The midterms are very reasonable. If we understand the material, then we will do well, and grading is very reasonable -- in this sense it is very encouraging for the students; we do not feel frustrated at all. Lecture notes are well written, and closely follow the textbook. TF Peter is amazing, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. 143a with Professor Doyle has been a very enjoyable experience for me. I love the class!","Quantum is a beautiful subject. Doyle follows griffiths religiously - read this before every lecture. Focus on main results of text \/ lecture. Doyle's exams are notoriously challenging. He seems to care about students in lecture - encouarages questions, tries to give content not shown in grffiths.  Homeworks are very long - work in a group, use mathematica. For many students, doyle ruins the overall experience with his notoriously difficult exams. To prepare for them, I would say stay on top  of the course throughout, try to do exams from previous years, focus on watching the clock.","Discovering the math and derivations behind the quantum topics that have permeated modern culture was extremely rewarding and interesting.","Fun and challenging, like most physics courses. Also, Prof. Doyle's a pretty cool guy.","Prof. Doyle is not the best teacher, but he is a lot better at teaching Quantum than Waves. The TF was fantastic and made the class worth taking. The material is very interesting. Make sure you really study for the final though because Prof. Doyle's finals are very difficult compared to what was done through out the rest of the class.","Learn about the teaching style of the professor teaching it, and think about taking it a different semester to learn what you want to learn."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is a great way to be introduced to the seemingly daunting field of quantum mechanics. The work isn't too overwhelming, as long as you keep up with the reading, and there was plenty of support from the professor and tfs if you needed help.","This course is fascinating. If you're doing physics, take it.","Great course. Very good text book. Makes quantum mechanics very clear","This course was a great introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics. Gives great insight into both the mathematical and physical parts of the course material\/","It is too bad that Professor Townsend will be here only for this one term because he is definitely an extraordinarily good teacher of quantum mechanics. He was extremely generous with his time, holding office hours for over 10 hours each week. The only thing I didn't like about this class was the flipped classroom model, which I find to be extremely silly and inefficient. Why flip something that has worked fine for centuries, especially when you have a very effective lecturer at the front?\r\n\r\nI feel bad for all future enrollees in 143a because it is unlikely that there will be as good of an offering of this course anytime in the near future. The Physics Department really should hire someone like Professor Townsend permanently... like a quantum mechanics version of David Morin. Until they do that, I encourage future enrollees to buy Townsend's textbook: it is very good and teaches quantum mechanics in a very engaging and sensible framework.","This class was great with Professor Townsend, but unfortunately he was only a guest professor for one semester from Harvey Mudd. Having heard how bad the class has been in the past with other professors, I can't speak to how well the class will run next semester and in the future. However, I would suggest adopting Professor Townsend's style of teaching in which everyone is required to read the sections before class and send questions and comments to the professor. I got a lot more out of this style of teaching than I have out of any other physics class.","It is often difficult to see the justification for many principles of quantum mechanics.  While some are justified simply because they agree with experiment, others have a mathematical justification.  It is important but often difficult to distinguish between these two kinds of justifications.","Do all of the problems in the book, It will aid you.","143a was incredible with Professor Townsend! I am not sure how it is with other professors, but Townsend made it incredibly interesting. This course definitely rekindled my passion for physics.","143a was an excellent course with a dedicated professor and staff, and even though the exams and 4am pset sessions made me fantasize about changing my concentration to Government, I don't regret a minute of it.  It's a pity that Townsend was only a visiting professor, though if Harvard can ever entice him to return for another semester, they should.","Not sure how this course will be taught in the future, but if it's anything like this year, I'd recommend it to anyone who is considering taking QM in some form (whether in physics, chem, etc).","It is a great class. It is too bad Townsend isn't teaching it again as he was fantastic.","Straightforward class, about the same difficulty and requirements as 15b with Morin. Prof. Townsend is very friendly and his book is clear. Don't expect the same depth of understanding that you get with 16. The problem sets also aren't particularly interesting. But you do come away with an appreciation for quantum mechanics and, at least for me, a deeper interest in studying more.","Chances are you need to take this class anyways for a physics requirement, and Professor Townsend is leaving, so I'm not sure how helpful this review will be for future students. I will say that I enjoyed the material in quantum far more than any of the physics classes I've taken prior. I found the subject to be interesting, surprisingly intuitive, and a lot of fun--it made me excited for physics in a way that I hadn't been for a while. Maybe it's because this is the first class in the intro sequence that breaks into the 20th century, but I really enjoyed it. Another note--a lot of people in this class skipped 15c to take it, and I think we all did fine. Talk to David Morin if you're considering this.","Honestly, I'd recommend this class solely because of Townsend. He was always so happy and enthusiastic about the material and willing to help that it really made the class so much better than it would have been otherwise. Yes, it was difficult, but that's to be expected at this level, though I did find it a bit unfair that a decent chunk of the math used was material from APMath 105 without it being an explicit pre- or coreq, and it was hard(er) to follow the chem-based problems given that I hadn't touched chem since a non-AP course junior year of high school. Still, I can't stress the fact that Townsend made it an overall very enjoyable class, and I doubt that I'll have another professor here willing to offer 12 hours of office hours a week and try so hard to get to know each of us on a more personal level. The teaching style was admittedly unorthodox (I have never read a textbook cover to cover before, and I don't think that I ever will again, but the method of reading before class and using class to answer questions was surprisingly effective, though that meant that the class was completely useless if you hadn't done the readings), but it worked out, and I'm sad to see him go. I feel sorry for anyone who has to take 143a with anyone besides him.","This is a great class to take after mastering classical physics. It is a springboard to more advanced classes. While quantum mechanics is challenging, Townsend is always very easy to follow, and the class's pace is entirely manageable.","QM is a really interesting subject. I really enjoyed the class with Townsend, though he won't be teaching it again. I know Vafa is teaching it next semester, and he's a boss; but nonetheless, whoever the professor I think QM is a beautiful, interesting, deep and non-trivial subject that is essential for every physicist, and definitely worth looking into even if you aren't doing physics but have the necessary skills (e.g. math\/applied math, or really anyone who isn't frightened by the unavoidable math element).","On this particular instance of the course:  Both Professor Townsend and TF Robbie Martinez were extremely approachable (Townsend actually had the most office hours I have ever seen held by a single professor) and helpful in one-on-one conversations. This year, the class was built almost entirely around answering student questions, and I think this is a fairly good way of going about things. Unfortunately, there isn't enough time to answer all student questions, but then, see above.\r\n\r\nOn Physics 143a: Quantum mechanics is actually awesome; it's the foundation on which we begin to see how the world works, and if you can understand it, other things in science begin to make a lot more sense. There are two parts to learning quantum mechanics for the first time:  learning physical theory, and learning the mathematical formalism which helps to build physical theory (and do calculations, of course). What can make this course difficult is having to learn both of these at the same time. If you either (1) have a very good grasp of physical intuition, or (2) have a very good grasp of mathematics, then this class is entirely doable (and extremely cool!).","This was an easy class, well taught, with a very accessible professor. Quantum mechanics is basically applied linear algebra. Easy to do the math, hard to understand what the math means.","This course was great, only because townsend was teaching it. You could really tell he cared about the class, and had put a lot of time into his book. One of my favorite physics classes so far, though it was quite challenging.","This is a really interesting class, but your experience will entirely vary on the professor teaching it. The notation and concepts are much more difficult to keep track of than the math itself, so read\/take notes\/do whatever is necessary to stay on top of that.","This class was with Professor Townsend, visiting from Harvey Mudd for the semester, so I don't know that it will be repeated like so again. I thought that the combination of Professor Townsend's lecture style with his textbook made for a very solid introduction to and understanding of quantum mechanics.","Well, this commentary is sort of meaningless since Professor Townsend is going back to Harvey Mudd, but I'll give it a go anyway.  This course was one of the best I've taken at Harvard.  Professor Townsend is a fantastic professor, an excellent lecturer, and also held long office hours nearly every day to help us understand the material.  His textbook is also really awesome and useful.  The course was certainly difficult but never overwhelming, and the tests and homework were generally fair.  All in all a fantastic course.","It's a real shame Townsend will be leaving after this semester; I found that the format of pre-lecture reading and in-class discussion was more productive than the usual lecture style that most other physics classes use. This course taught me a lot, and did a good job of giving me a good foundation for future work in physics. Again, my experience may not be replicable on account of visiting faculty.","Hard to say anything since the course was given by a visiting professor who only spends one term at Harvard. Therefore the course will most likely be very different next time.","This is it.  This is Harvard quantum.  Your mileage may vary depending on your professor, your textbook, etc., but whatever comes through that door, hold your ground.  You will be rewarded with the knowledge of how truly, truly strange is this universe of ours and how to quantify that in various ways.","This is a great class, especially with Professor Townsend. I would take this class again with him.","If you have taken a lot of math and are a brilliant physics student you will be fine. On the other hand, if you have taken the Physics 15 series and Math 21 series and do NOT do additional math studies in your free time, you will probably feel extremely stupid. This course is oriented towards the top 10% of the class and leaves the rest in the dust. However, Professor Townsend did have 29835720 office hours every week which were very helpful. Overall: interesting but intimidating.","Quantum mechanics was awesome. That being said, the problems are hard, the tests are tricky, and this is time intensive. If you put in the work, you will see the results. Townsend was an amazing professor - too bad he was only here for this semester!","A pretty standard treatment of introductory quantum mechanics. Professor Townsend and the TF's (especially Robbie) really made this class well above average this semester. The problem sets are reasonable, helpful, and interesting. Professor Townsend's textbook is very good and provides a solid backbone for the course to follow. This class had the best section component to any class I've taken at Harvard, you basically work in groups to solve problems on the board which are exactly like the questions on the psets and the exams. Too bad Professor Townsend will be returning to Harvey Mudd next semester, hopefully he comes back at some point! I'd recommend this to anyone with an inkling of interest in physics or theoretical chemistry.","Professor Townsend made this class. The material is pretty interesting, but it's only going to be cool if you put the time into it and someone cogently and coherently explains it to you."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a great course, and Vafa puts a lot of work into his lectures to make them informative and well-paced.  Read the textbook - it will help immensely.","143a is the first intro physics class that is really exciting. You get to learn new physics instead of just harder versions of the E&M\/mechanics that you did in high school. If you understand linear algebra well, it won't be that hard.","A very well-taught course that provides just the right level of intro to Quantum Mechanics. The grading is a little weird, because the grader is some random guy who doesn't know what's going on in class.\r\n\r\nThe workload is so well balanced -- when there's a midterm, there's no pset, and longer psets get extra time.","Vafa seems \"mysterious\", but \"there is nothing fancy\" to his style. He's a straightforward, interesting, engaging lecturer. His sweaters are mad ill, too. If he's teaching in the fall, definitely take this class for the fall\/winter fashion. \r\n\r\nYou will not make friends in this course. Physics people are mean. :( \r\n\r\nVafa's exams were absurd at times. Like, actually absurd. Don't get sad if you don't do well on them - they don't reflect how much you've learned very well at all. \r\n\r\nOverall, a solid course on a really amazing topic. I highly recommend it.","This course is just linear algebra of Hilbert spaces. Very little actual physics is discussed; most of the time is spent diagonalizing matrices, integrating wavefunctions, solving boundary conditions on flat, discontinuous potentials, etc. Very little time is spent discussing the implications of the results we have found, so it feels like you haven't actually learned any physics.","Vafa's an engaging lecturer and a good teacher. However, at times it felt like we got bogged down in the formalism and missed some of the physical intuition.","Pretty fundamental class to take if you're studying physics. Lots of calculations and working out problems.","It is the single greatest physics class I have taken at Harvard.","Lots of math, not a lot of physics. It's good if you want to be able to solve basic problems about quantum systems. It's bad if you want to delve into the weird concepts surrounding quantum mechanics, because those were pushed aside. The goal was to avoid confusion instead of attacking it head on.","This class was very challenging, but you will learn a lot. I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun, but if you have to take it as a requirement, it will be probably better (albeit harder) than the 15 series.","If you're taking it, you should be a physics major who has to take it and likes physics. If you're a physics major who doesn't really like physics, change your major and don't take more of the same stuff you don't enjoy.","This course has made going through 15 abc completely worth it! Quantum Mechanics is entirely new and exciting, and if you're not excited for it then frankly you're not cut out for physics. If you are burnt out from the other physics courses and want to take a break, think again, especially if Professor Vafa is teaching. QM will make you think about things in a completely different way, even if you can't really see it's effects at the scales that we see.","Vafa taught it this year and his lectures were the best of any physics or math class I've had so far. The format of the textbook is very good, however be aware that the first few weeks are very easy and suddenly becomes much more difficult around week 8. However even then it's completely manageable.","This course was fairly enjoyable, and quite light in terms of workload. A solid introduction to QM.","Very hard course! Please learn the notation before taking this class.","David Farhi is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the Harvard Physics Department. He was able to explain concepts to me in just a few minutes that I couldn't even fathom understanding beforehand. Professor Vafa's lectures are very heavy on proofs, so make sure you go to section\/office hours to get examples. A standard problem set in any Vafa class consists of one or two impossibly difficult questions written by him and then 6 or so manageable book problems. Get help with the Vafa questions. The book was also a very useful source.","If you manage to learn any actual physics in this class\/from the book and not just how to do mindlessly do a bunch of calculations, that's very impressive ... because I honestly think I couldn't tell you the slightest bit about the physics. Maybe a bit about classifying irreducible representations of the Lie Algebra su(2), but the physics, nah...","Cumrun Vafa is a very entertaining lecturer, but the course proved to be rather difficult overall.","quantum is pretty cool, not too much calculation with vafa which was pretty nice. the teacher seems to change term to term so this may not apply. vafa was a really good lecturer. overall a solid course","It can be hard at times, but SO worth it.","Very interesting course, even though exams were sometimes tough. Vafa is a great lecturer, and David is an excellent section leader.","This class requires a lot of mathematical proficiency. Make sure that you know linear algebra well and are familiar with complex exponentials. The Townsend book uses this material very early. Later weeks will require more wave mechanics but they are not used early on. Still you need to be familiar with wave mechanics before taking this course or the later weeks will be quite difficult."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Quantum is very interesting material, and Professor Reece does a great job teaching it!","Of course you have to take this course as a physics concentrator, but the physics is really cool!  Your enjoyment in it really seems to come from how much you can understand and connect with the material.  The class itself is very standard.  The lectures and textbook go through the material, and section reviews it.  Although I found lectures very dry (but effective), the sections were awesome!  Dominik (TF) is very good at reinforcing topics, and I feel like his sections were highly underutilized.","This class is an organized introduction to the tools you'll need to study quantum mechanics, and builds a pretty solid foundation. It was a lot more centered on algebra and operators for the most part than on their physical implications, however. It might be useful and inspiring every now and then to explore for yourself how the starting points that class offers fit in with cool, counterintuitive quantum stuff - looking at the later chapters in Townsend by yourself (that we didn't get to in class), like the ones on electromagnetic fields, if you find the time, could be a way of doing this.","Take 151 either before or concurrently. If you are a physics major, you have no excuse playing around with the Hamiltonian as an operator and not knowing where it comes from. (Understanding canonical transformations also helps with some conceptual stuff later on in the course).","This class is super interesting! Prof.Reece has such a wonderful personality and is really willing to chat\/help. Townsend does a great job setting up the linear algebra background prep for the less comfortable students. This class is completely doable with a reasonable schedule, but you do need to put in a considerable amount of time. \nSpecial advice for ChemPhys\/CPB concentrators who are looking into Chem40 and this class: I actually recommend taking this class before Chem40. All the qualitative analysis of MO theory in Chem40 will make a ton more sense after this class.","This course, as taught by Prof. Reece, was truly excellent - far better than it was with any previous professor in recent memory, judging from the experiences of most of the physics concentrators with whom I've spoken. Lectures were truly wonderful; Prof. Reece's explanations and the order in which he presented content was extremely comprehensible and comprehensive. Problem sets were very well crafted: an excellent balance between challenging and reasonable in length and time required. And, finally, Prof. Reece's decision to forego chapter 11 (perturbation theory) in favor of a discussion of more conceptually interesting topics like the Bell inequalities, entanglement, teleportation, etc, was really excellent; he really cared that we come away with some knowledge of not just the mathematical framework, but of some of the larger-reaching implications of quantum mechanics and some basic understanding of why it will be important technologically in years to come. \nHowever, the physics department seems, inexplicably, irrationally, and, frankly, stupidly, to have a new person teach this course each semester, so I doubt that Prof. Reece will teach this again anytime soon. If you're lucky enough to have a chance to take it with him -- do so! If not, though, my above comments will likely have no bearing on your experience, as the quality and characteristics of the course vary wildly between professors.","Quantum mechanics is a really cool subject! Professor Reece was a pretty clear lecturer, problem sets and exams were pretty fair, and the book was easy to understand. It's hard to grapple with the concepts though - they're certainly not intuitive. Leave time to let quantum sink into your brain.","143a is the likely the first time you'll be doing actually *new* physics during your undergraduate career. Enjoy it - there's a fair bit of algebraic obnoxiousness involved, but it's still pretty cool stuff.","It's quantum.  You can't not take quantum (assuming you're a physicist) so you're kinda stuck with it.  Just hope that the professor is better next year.","Quantum Mechanics is amazing. I believe that anyone interested in science should at least take one semester of quantum mechanics to just be amazed by it. This semester was at a particularly good pace - not too fast, not crazily difficult - so it was a wonderful semester for me to have taken this class as an elective.","This is a good introduction to quantum mechanics. Most of it is just linear algebra; not that you'll have to study up, but familiarity is probably helpful! Matthew Reece is a concise lecturer; he's very nice.","Solid and very mathematical foundation in QM.","It's hard to evaluate a course which changes from year to year. Quantum is a pretty necessary class, and it knows it. I found that Reece's lectures were excellent in the beginning, but got too technical (to make the math clear), s.t. it took a great deal of effort and outside help to give meaning to what we were doing. I would highly recommend supplementing this course with readings from Griffiths quantum.","Quantum mechanics is a fascinating topic, and Professor Reece taught it quite well. The class was engaging but at the same time rigorous. It was challenging, but not overwhelming.  Don't get too worried about the 15 a\/c prerequisite; Very little material from these classes is actually invoked. By far more important is linear algebra. Would absolutely recommend to anybody interested in physics and math!","For those who are Chem\/Phys and hesitating between a physics quantum or chem quantum, I would highly recommend this course. While challenging, it is entirely manageable and rewarding. You will learn quantum in a rigorous and logical manner. Great course.","If you're a physics concentrator, then you have to take this class. It's not too difficult, but can be a little dry sometimes as it is an introduction course. Reece is very clear (though can be a little dry when lecturing), and a great guy.
