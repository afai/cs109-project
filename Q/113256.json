'08":{"comments":["I would tell future students that it is a great way to fulfill the introduction to sociology requirement for sociology majors.  For non-concentrators interested in business or wanting to understand how organizations work this is the class to take.  It was an amazing class that I really liked and would recommend to anyone who is interested enough to even ask about it.","This is one of the best courses you could probably take as as undergrad at Harvard. Don't miss your chance!","hard, but lectures are interesting and section is fun.","They should be prepared to take in a lot of information and process it quickly.  Then choose the important stuff and throw out the rest.","Although the topic sounds dull, the course was really interesting and a lot of fun. It is definitely useful for anyone since almost everyone will be a part of or work in an organization.","Prof. Ager is one of the best professors I have had at Harvard. The class is very good at integrating organizational theory with examples. The material is very interesting. The workload is very reasonable and you will leave this class knowing a lot about organizations regardless how hard you work for it.","That perhaps there is no engaging way to teach the sociology of organizations (even for a talented professor).","Take this class!  It's fun and useful (esp. if you want to work after college).  Doing the reading is more or less unnecessary.  Go to lecture - Ager is wonderful and tries to include students in the discussion as much as possible.","A lot of learning relative to the little work required; good if you don't expect earth-shattering revelations from it.","I would just tell them to be prepared to work hard on the final project.","Professor Ager is a very accessible and entertaining professor.  Section discussions are also entertaining.","This class is great for anyone looking to take a class on the world of business.","Practical, fun, insightful, and the teaching staff cares about teaching... you're sure this is still Harvard college?","Do the readings on time. Consistently. If I took this again, I'd a) not order my book (got it late and was behind on reading from the get-go) and b) get together a study group to take notes on each reading.","take it for first-hand experience in evaluating an organization and understanding some basic introduction to sociology","Only take this class if you want to go to business school.","It would probably be better with a better section leader, but the subject matter is still pretty dry.","Take it if you're at all interested in business, leadership, or organizations.","It was interesting enough, but only if you have an interest in the analysis of organizations."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Be prepared to engage interactively in section","Interesting and not terribly demanding class. Assignments and grading can be frustrating sometimes. Material is interesting but sometimes not well synthesized.","Great professor, great TF, interesting course material, good readings - everything was positive","great topics, good introduction to business studies, however the professor can be a bit dry in lecture","It's not for everyone--you have to like the HBS cases and you have to like the type of readings we do, which are a mix of organizational theory and history. But if you are interested in that sort of thing, I full recommend it.","It is a great class and I fully recommend it.","The course was very interesting and helped me picked a concentration that I feel I will love.","This is a great class, is interesting and does not require too much of your time.","If you have any interest in how businesses have evolved and how they function today, this is a great introductory class.","It is very helpful if you hope to pursue a career in business.","Be sure to attend class.  It may sound basic but a large percentage of the class is not there by the middle of the year.  If you don't have the time to do the reading, it's fine because most people never do the reading anyway.","A great intro sociology course to take especially if you are interested in business and management.","Do not show up to any of the lectures. Do not do any of the readings. Just go to section and join a study group at the end and you'll dominate the class.","The course is very interesting, and can be very helpful for people interested in pursuing any form of business."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["I loved the class- the lectures and the case studies, but I wasn't fond of the Professor's attitude and personality.  He presented a personal skewed bias too often in lecture.","The course is actually great and provides a good balance between helping to build practical skills that might help you  get a job in consulting (if that's what you're into) via the case studies and helping you to think sociologically. I particularly like how this course taught me to become more skeptical about efficiency arguments backing the many strategies firms pursue. My TF was great at helping us to tease apart the cases. The assignments for this class were rather tedious, however, and graded in a way as though they were expecting a certain right answer. I was frustrated sometimes with my peers, many of whom didn't set this class as a priority and never did the readings. This made section discussions sometimes rather awkward and somewhat superficial.","This has been my favorite class at Harvard so far. I think that it is extremely helpful to understand organizations and the class did a great job of explaining the structure of organizations.","Very interesting material. You learn a great deal about management practices and organizational theories.","It's not that hard of a class.  I recommend having a strong interest in the subject if you want to take it though because otherwise it'll be really boring.","This class is a really interesting look at the development of management systems and organizations. Definitely a worthwhile class to take.","This course is great if you want to get an idea of the different types of jobs available in the labor market. Also worth taking if you ever see yourself in a managerial position or at least a position with subordinates.","Great course for senior spring! Interesting topics. It's really neat to learn about the history of business and management theories. I would say this is a good introduction to the business literature AND what sociology is all about. A nice balance of the two. \r\n\r\nProfessor Dobbin is also a hysterical lecturer (whether intentional or not). He has these wonderful stories, and rewards people who come to lecture with free stuff! What's not to like? \r\n\r\nThe readings...although sometimes long...are written mostly in plain English and are comprehensible by a non-humanities major. The HBS case studies are really great to read. And, it's prolly one of the cheapest classes when it comes to textbooks. The pre-section \/ reading questions make doing the readings actually useful. The papers are manageable and fair. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a nice straight-forward course. No one is trying to trick you or make life unbearably difficult for you like some other classes. The material is interesting, teaching staff is great, and you do take a lot away from the course.","The exam is a bit harder than you might expect, given the unexpected two-hour limit. Overall, however, the class was enjoyable. It provides you with a very thorough guide to the history of organizations in America.","This was the best class I have ever taken.  It taught me so much about \"the real world\" outside of Harvard, and I looked forward to Dobbin's lectures every week.","Besides the case studies and the lectures this course is extremely boring and is definitely not as easy as it seems in the first few weeks.","great class for anyone interested in business and management. though sometimes, the terminology can be confusing for anyone not familiar with econ or business, but the tfs are always willing to clear up any confusion.","Great if you want some exposure to business cases and to theories of business management and corporate strategy.","it's a good intro to sociology class, especially if you're interested in business at all. it's all about american business, in fact. dobbins is entertaining.","this is a great class for anyone interested in how businesses think - especially how they do not always act \"efficiently.\"  it is not particularly difficult, and all of the readings are very interesting - particularly the case studies.","Very interesting subject matter with strong lectures and sections! Not a hard way to fulfill or requirement and a good elective to take if you are considering going into business post-college.","If you are interested in business\/consulting, this is definitely the class to take. Especially if you are not very math-oriented.","It's about business management (wow; how in the world did I enroll without realizing what the course was going to be like?) but you can learn quite a bit if you do the readings.","Whether you're interested in the public or private sectors, this class will illuminate some of the problems inherent in large organizations of any nature. So, if you're interested in hearing about that, then take this course.","Interesting course","If you want to learn something useful in your years at Harvard, take this class.","because of professor dobbin, it is unclear what gain you will receive because he is somewhat all over the place","a great sociology intro course","Be sure to have a background in business.","This was a great class--one of the best I have taken at Harvard.","Be prepared for sections; it will save you embarrassment and will help you immensely later on","You will come to understand society in a new way and realize how organizations emerged to exist as they are today.","90% of us will spend much of our lives working in a corporation, and 99.9% of us will be working as part of an organization (or at least dealing with one) - definitely worth it to examine how and why they are set up the way they are.  Few courses at Harvard have the same applicability to daily life and certainly professional life after college.  Very painless, assignments and exams on the whole pretty fair.  TFs very approachable, accessible, dedicated, and super informative.","This class felt like a business management class, which is not an explicit genre at Harvard. I liked being able to learn about management of organizations and businesses in a relatively student-friendly framework without the hassles of many ec classes. Sections are great. Be prepared to engage with a lot of ideas and form your own. This is not a passive class.","Go to the lectures, they are interesting and a lot of the exam questions are on material covered in them.","Its good if you want to learn about business strategy.","It's an easy class with interesting material. The workload is pretty nonexistent... I went to all the lectures but I know some people who did well in the class without going to most of them.","I have mixed feelings. The teaching staff is great, but the material and readings can get complex, grueling, and unnecessarily long. The use of case studies are the one bright spot in the readings material. The course doesn't really seem to flow either... at times things just feel like a hodgepodge of topics all thrown together.","This is a great class that at first seems like it's great for people with an interest in business, but it's much more than that.  Anybody who is interested in organizations in general, power dynamics, inequality, or the \"progress\" of society should take this class.","Very heavy on theory so some of the readings are a little dense, but the HBS case studies are great and in general the course is very relevant and applicable if you are interested in business, non-profit management, etc.","This course provides you a whole different way of looking at everything, especially changing the rationalist-economistic way outlook. In addition, the course has incredibly informative lectures, and very productive sections that it is definite that you will learn a lot. This is one of those courses with only a moderate amount of reading (which is also incredibly interesting), but every reading provides you with a lot of insight. In short, it's definitely a low-risk, high return course.","There are only 3 essays that are not very difficult, and the final is not horribly difficult either.  However, the weekly readings are hard to get through, lecture is pretty boring.  Section is great though (you read HBS case studies).","A truly interesting class which gives you insight into how businesses are organized throughout history. A must-take for any student who wants to go into the business world.","Take it if you really have to.","This class presents interesting material in a completely understandable way.  No matter if you are interested in sociology, understanding how organizations work and how to manage a workforce will be valuable in any future career aspirations.","Professor Dobbin was a very good lecturer, and he made going to lecture not so bad. The material was generally interesting, and his stories were relevant and funny."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I thought this would be a fun, interesting elective. NO. It was the worst course I have taken at Harvard by far. Ironically, the class had almost zero organization: Grading was completely arbitrary, assignments were pretty useless (wiki entries) and no rubric was given, feedback was laughable, and most of the TF's were not fluent in English.\r\n\r\nHere were my suggested improvements-- which can give you a flavor of what this class really is.\r\n\r\n1) Have TF's that can better speak the English language. I do not intend to be mean, but honestly, in a class based on discussion, having a TF struggle with communicating in English is unacceptable at a top rate university in the world\r\n\r\n2) Have clear assignment instructions and rubric. The \"wiki\" assignments were incredibly dumb. The grading was completely arbitrary. Not once were we given some kind of rubric for how to make our paper a \"good wiki.\" That's really unacceptable since the assignment format is very unusual-- a wiki assignment with no thesis.\r\n\r\n3) Incorporate \"participation\" as part of the grading. How can it only detract from your score? That doesn't make sense. Furthermore, it's supposed to be discussion-based, so why is this not a part of the grade?","I hope they offer it again. Best class ive taken. Easy, fun, interesting, and easy","The reading is a little dry, but the assignments are not too tough.","This course is geared towards non-sociology concentrators (mainly people who know they're going into investment banking, etc and want business management experience). It is not a good course for those who are interested in sociology as a concentration, regardless of its status as an intro class. Assignments (for the first time, from my understanding) were supposed to be written and posted like Wikipedia pages. It's a great response to the cheating scandals recently, but there's a frisson between writing for your TF (academically) versus writing for the general public. \r\n\r\nLectures can also be painfully awkward. Professor Dobbins will not give up awkward silences and will wait it out. Section can be similar. The material is great if you're interested and there are many overarching themes that make it conceptually great, but there are probably better classes out there.","learn a lot without doing a lot of work","The material in this class has been the most-applicable to material found in the real world than any other course I have taken.  This class significantly helps you understand the workings of companies, and the workload of the course is very manageable and interesting","The course material in this class was very interesting. However that does not counteract the bad lectures, weird wikipedia article-style writing assignments, and lack of good TFs. Not the greatest of courses.","Great class, good material, and an awesome chance to see some case studies and really get a feel for how companies work and how they come to be successful","The class is very easy and the content is interesting and relevant","This class focuses on a very relevant and interesting topic, and is one of the only classes at Harvard that discusses corporations and organizations in any context. However, I would definitely warn people considering this class that it does NOT have the most interesting or engaging of lectures. Section is nice because it's based on HBS case studies, and the assignments (3 short essays + final) are all very fair.","take it","The topic is interesting but the course itself does not have interesting material and is not taught well.","It's really easy so if you need an easy class, take it. It has some correlation with an interest in business. You won't learn that much that you don't already know.","this class requires a pulse and that is about it for a good grade. that said, you probably won't learn anything.","This class is interesting and the case study component really brings the material to life.","It's an easy class. The wikipedia assignments are short but require a bit of research. The final is straightforward if you do the readings (or make a study group for the final). Prof. Dobbin can be a bit pretentious (jokingly perhaps...) in his lectures. He doesn't engage students in the material very well.","It was a little dull sometimes, but interesting when related to the present.","Awesome course; interesting lectures and readings, and the assignments were definitely manageable.","Very interesting material and lectures, although written assignments were a bit confusing regarding what the actual question\/guidelines are.","it is very manageable and interesting","This was a very enjoyable course. The material is fascinating and the HBS case studies enhance the theoretical concepts and are very interesting. It is a painless and worthwhile class. I highly recommend it!","The course covers extremely interesting material that is very relevant to our everyday lives. Dobbin is a great lecturer and very knowledgeable about the subject matter. The reading list is great, and the topics covered in this course all fit together in a very cohesive manner. You really learn a lot from this class, and the sections are great!","It is interesting but a bit dry.","The lecture slides aren't that well organized which makes lecture seem a little random but other than that, the class was manageable, not too hard, and interesting.","Read the case studies because they are applicable and quite enjoyable.","The assignments in this class are unnecessarily (and unintentionally) painful. To do well on the assignments, you literally need to \"dumb down\" your writing because your papers are supposed to be structured as Wikipedia articles. Too bad most of our papers kept getting taken down from Wikipedia. Who knew - encyclopedias aren't supposed to contain research papers written for a college class. In addition, the assignment prompts are ambiguous, poorly written, and generally unsuitable for any kind of intelligent, analytical writing. Not to mention, the grading is unbelievably arbitrary. \r\n\r\nThe most frustrating part of the course was the lectures. They are so unorganized and meaningless. I made the mistake of going to every single one in the hopes that I would learn something. I was repeatedly proven wrong. Don't waste your time with this class.","Materials are interesting. Lectures could possibly be the worst. Tangents with no ends and frequent moments of awkward silences.","The material and the case studies are actually pretty interesting. Its a bit frustrating that half of the grade is based on writing wikipedia articles and the grading can seem arbitrary at times. The final exam was fair as long as you had studied.","Some TFs wanted too much out of short wikipedia articles, so be wary of taking this course because the papers are shorter.","The subject is interesting, but make sure you know what is expected on the assignments because they are graded harshly.","This is not one of Harvard's finest. Lectures were not great, the assignments were not difficult but just not fun at all. I would not recommend this class.","This is an interesting class and gives a good introduction to the sociology of organizations. I would recommend it to anyone interested in business, but it is a cool class and not too much work.","Professor Dobbin is a leader in his field and a clear, engaging lecturer. \r\n\r\nGuest lectures assumes that you understand the basic vocabulary of finance. Take some time to pick up key phrases from online guides before taking this course, and you'll be set to participate in full. HBS case studies are fantastic - take this class if only to engage with this content from a sociological perspective. It's a joy.","I didn't really appreciate this class until taking the final exam- lectures are kind of boring, and sections are a little weird. But in studying for the exam, I realized I learned a ton, and that it was helpful and interesting knowledge- so I would recommend it.","the lectures are hard to follow, but what you actually learn is helpful in the real world","Take it if you are interested in business and organizations.","Interesting content, lectures were great. Expectations for assignments were unclear. Final was extremely straightforward. Section component of the course was engaging and Christy did a great job facilitating discussion. The case studies are a great supplement to the material learned in class.","This class is a great learning tool for one who wants to go into the business world. This class describes the changing business world through an organizational lens.","The lectures are very boring and you don't need to go to them.","a lot of reading, but not bad. the assignments are not too taxing and the course was much more enjoyable than i thought it would be at the start","Really a history of organizations course. Not as easy or as interesting as it seems during shopping period. It may seem like an easy elective, but get ready to put in a lot of busy work in a poorly run class.","The ironic thing about this class is that it is about organizations, but is itself very poorly organized. We were given assignments of Wikipedia entries that had extremely strict word limits that hindered good writing and fully answering the prompt resulting in feedback like \"explain this more.\" TFs were definitely not uniform in their grading and expectations for assignments, so when taking this class with friends, don't take their word for what their TF said to hold true for you as well. In addition, grades felt so arbitrary because the assignments did not provide a rubric. The sad thing is that the HBS case studies are actually very interesting and the material is also quite interesting. The class has lots of potential, but is SO frustrating because of the grading and assignments.","The lectures were not very good, but the section component was great.  Relaxed, not too much work, and some interesting topics are covered.","I personally found the material to be very interesting, but the readings often got boring.  Vince Feng's sections were interesting, although we never really had much of a discussion going on.  Case studies were pretty interesting though.  And after studying for the final, I realized that I did indeed learn a lot from this course.","This class gives you a better understanding of why organizations are structured in the way that they are today. The course work is pretty minimal.","Boring lecture, boring readings, boring class.","Interesting course, practical, can alter how you think about businesses, and easy","Great course. Dobbin is a great lecturer and the material is very relevant to everything going on in the world since everything is an organization. Highly recommend and the course work is very manageable with short assignments.","Pretty easy and straight-forward class","Take this class. It's super easy, low time commitment, and really really interesting. Prof Dobbin is great, clearly was a bro back in the day, gives great lectures, and hands out chocolate on multiple occasions. Also get Gru Han for your TF - he's also hilarious and also provides food during section...","It is what you make of it. If you invest yourself you can learn and probably retain a lot of very cool information but if you dont motivate yourself you can slide by without learning much at all","the class is pretty disorganized but it does present some interesting concepts and overall it was pretty harmless.","BEWARE! This class does not deliver what is advertised.  Lectures are extremely difficult to follow and apply to the readings and section.  Professor Dobbin is a great person- very charismatic and fair, but this class itself is terrible.  Seriously reconsider taking this class if you want to.","This class wasn't the most interesting at times, but the assignments were very manageable and the TFs were always nice and helpful with these assignments, especially when the instructions weren't very clear.","pretty interesting material and the assignments are not difficult. the teaching staff also enjoy the class and are invested in it","The assignments, though short, are more involved than you might expect and wikipedia is not the easiest format to get used to.","The class was really interesting and fun, but the assignments were vague and lacked sufficient guidance.","The class was very interesting and practical. The readings were Case Studies that described the operation of actual firms so it was very intriguing to read.","Great class. Interesting, manageable work load, and great professor.","Class topics are very interesting. The assignments were very easy and Professor Dobbin is great. Definitely a great elective","The class was a lot harder than expected and there was a lot of reading.","The course material and case studies are really interesting. They apply to a lot of current-day organizations and the world of business in general. However, Professor Dobbin isn't the most energetic lecturer. He teaches the course well but with stuff as interesting as this, I'd think he could be more enthusiastic and engaging during lecture. At times it was difficult to pay attention because it seemed that even the Professor wasn't interested in the topic at hand.","good introductory course to sociology","It teaches you basics about sociology and business organization.","Great course.  Professor Dobbin is a great lecturer and tries to tailor the class to relevant themes in consulting, banking, etc. Very enjoyable section and assignments aren't too onerous.","Take this if you ever want to start a business or find a career in finance","I would tell future students to shop this class carefully and think through the decision to take it before enrolling.  I jumped into it without much thought, and definitely regretted my decision.  Although I understand that it is a class that people think is \"easy,\" I found myself bored in class and frustrated that almost everyone came to section without having done any of the week's readings.  I also found Professor Dobbin to be a little bit hard to follow, and not the most effective lecturer.  Furthermore, I found the subject material to be much more about business and economics than I had anticipated.  Unless you are interested in business or economics long-term, I wouldn't take this course."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a very good class for anyone interested in business or life itself.","It is a very fair class. The material is interesting and relevant. The assignments are useful in understanding the material. There are no surprises- the work is doable as long as you try.","Don't take this course as an 'easy\/senior spring\/cop out course.  Not that it will eat you alive, but I think it ruins the quality of the course for those of us who are in it to learn the material in a meaningful way.","Dobbin talks in a very dry manner but the material outlined in his lectures is great. Case studies seem like a big part of the course at the beginning, but they actually aren't used that extensively. Overall, the course is really great because of the material, but it isn't to die for. I would say you can learn all the things you would learn in it from a textbook!","This class was great to take. You learn a ton about organizational theory and management practices. Great for those interested in these fields. The material was very relevant and the course utilizes a lot of case studies to supplement. The readings can get extremely dense and long, however.","Great class.   Prof. Dobbin has great lectures and the workload is minimal","For anyone interested in going into business, this course is essential. The opportunity to study HBS Cases should definitely be taken advantage of!","The readings can be long, but the section slides are helpful.","Do not take this course as your introduction to sociology. It is more of a preparation course for those that are graduating and moving into the real world. Definitely catered toward seniors.","Very engaging lectures and sections.","Great class that provides you with an extensive introduction to practices and processes within organizations. Professor Dobbin is a good lecturer and Christy Ley is a great TF!","This course is theory-heavy.","This class is easy enough. The papers take some time, but they are essentially the only real work that you have for the class other than the final. Lectures are a bit boring\/slow - if you can get the video and watch it '2x' I would do that. Christy was wonderful.","Ignore all the Q-scores from before this year. They have completely redone the course and the assignments. I really enjoyed this class...lecture was always interesting and the assignments were fair (3 short papers) and helped with your understanding of the course.","fantastic course, very interesting"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"32","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 25","course_id":"4628","cat_num":"3609","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"8","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 25","course_id":"4628","cat_num":"3609","1s":"0","2s":"12","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 25","course_id":"4628","cat_num":"3609","1s":"4","2s":"16","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
