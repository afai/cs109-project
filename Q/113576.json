Definitely think twice unless you really want to learn the language."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It is a huge time commitment, so make sure you are truly committed to learning the language. If you have just a casual interest in learning Turkish, you may wonder why you're spending 2-3 hours every night doing homework for something you may not encounter again. The class is fairly flexible, for better or for worse-- you can help mold the syllabus if you feel that it should change, but it also can surprise you with unexpected work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"3.80","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TURKISH 120a","course_id":"3889","cat_num":"4009","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"TURKISH 120a","course_id":"3889","cat_num":"4009","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"TURKISH 120a","course_id":"3889","cat_num":"4009","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
