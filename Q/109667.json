I was not interested in many of the papers we read for each class, so did not get much out of most classes. Yaron seemed to pick papers based on what he wanted an excuse to read, rather than what he thought would be best for students to learn about. Nor did he try to generate enthusiasm among the students. So while I learned a lot from a few of the papers, I felt that most of my time in this course could have been better spent elsewhere.","Good course to take to get a feel of what's the current areas of graph algorithms and research are","The course covers very interesting material! Assignments and projects can be somewhat disorganized, but all in all if you're interested in the subject matter you'll find it rewarding."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"5.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 284r","course_id":"10730","cat_num":"74473","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 284r","course_id":"10730","cat_num":"74473","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 284r","course_id":"10730","cat_num":"74473","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
