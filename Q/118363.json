Take it if you want to be more aware of architecture, but do not expect to gain a complete foundation.","anyone interested in architecture or renaissance history should definitely take this class.","Photocopy the coursepack! (apparently the teachers don't want to do it for us).","the course is extremely disorganized, but the material is interesting and if it interests you, it's worth learning.","all the villas and renaissance buildings look the same!  plus, prof. payne never repeated the names of the buildings (and rolled her eyes when i would ask questions), so my notes are not clear!  the class was not well organized, either.\r\ni would only recommend this class to someone who really was interested in the material and knew a bit about it already.","Material has potential to be more interesting.","The course was easy but not particularly rewarding.","this class is interesting especially if you have traveled to Italy, France, or Spain - it is fun to learn a little more about some of the major landmarks that one might have seen in travel.  the course is generally pretty interesting and entertaining, though section and the readings aren't strongpoints.  Prof. Payne is engaging and enthusiastic","It is a good course for those interested in Renaissance architecture."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The stuff you learn here is not just confined to the Renaissance. Ideas and forms from that era continue into the present, and it's really helpful and eye-opening to know about their beginnings.","This is a good class to take if you are really interested in the material; also, though it's a lecture class, it's still very small (~12 people).","Great subject matter that helps us understand trends in architecture even today, Prof. Payne is very knowledgeable so don't be shy in asking questions, Cara is a wonderful TF who thinks about section in creative ways in order to best serve the students and help us internalize the course material."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you are interested in architecture, this course is great!","Pay attention in lecture even if it is tempting to do other things and do all of the readings! I really wish I had because I think I would have taken so much more out of the class.","HAA 51p is an AMAZING introductory-level HAA course! I took it as one of my introductory requirements, and even though I was not initially interested in either Renaissance or architecture, Prof. Payne and Elizabeth managed to cultivate a deep interest in me! Prof. Payne, one of the top Renaissance Architecture scholars, provides a brilliant large framework to situate Renaissance in different cultures from those of the Colonial Latin America to that of the Ottoman Empire, and with carefully chosen required texts, prepares the ground for stimulating debates. She's also very approachable and helpful in person. One cannot talk about this course without also mentioning the extraordinary TF Elizabeth Kasser-Taub, who conducts sessions seamlessly with a high but manageable pace. This is not just a course for learning about Renaissance Architecture as a relic of the past, but as the foundations of today's architecture. This paradigmatic course is not to be missed if you have the tiniest intention to pursue a career related to architecture!","This class regardless if you're interested in architecture specifically or not is definitely one to take. It will make you so much more aware of all the architecture that surrounds you and really gives you a new perspective on all the monumental works that you already know to exist.","This was a great introduction to not just the architecture of the Renaissance, but also to the ways in which building interacted with the other arts and the way Renaissance forms connected with others both geographically and temporally. The small class size and very flexible written assignment also allowed students to explore whatever they were interested in, which I appreciated.","It's a great overview of Renaissance architecture.  I'm usually hesitant about any courses that are introductions or large surveys, but this course does a remarkable job in covering a wide range of material while staying very focused and going in-depth.  The work always feels manageable and the teaching staff is very intelligent.  Professor Payne is an expert in her field (very insightful!) and it would behoove you to learn from the best.","Professor Payne is a engaging lecturer and very generous with the material she presents in her lecture. I would highly recommend it.","Professor Payne is a wonderful professor and Elizabeth was such an amazing TF. The course is structured in an interesting way, it's not too much work or reading, but just enough that you feel like you're challenging yourself to learn."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.45","difficulty":"3.18","recommendation":"4.64","enrollment":"16","response rate":"68.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 51p","course_id":"2548","cat_num":"6427","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 51p","course_id":"2548","cat_num":"6427","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 51p","course_id":"2548","cat_num":"6427","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
