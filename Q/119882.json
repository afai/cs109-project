I took it on a whim, and now it's part of my joint concentration. The department is fabulous, Alex Watson is brilliant, and the TF Ben is incredibly helpful and patient. I highly recommend this course!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Prepare to work hard, and learn a lot. You will learn so much by the end of the year. You'll be able to read epic literature, as well as Classical Sanskrit poetry like Kalidasa (well, with some help).","I would tell students that this is a tough course, and it is necessary to make sure that you are on top of your memorization and work throughout the semester. This is not a course possible to pull off at the very end.","If you are willing to do the work, you should take it","Difficult but great class, with excellent and dedicated teachers.","Probably don't take another language course along with this one, it is hard to keep up.","1) This class will chew you up and spit you out. No one warned me, so I feel I should warn you. It involves untold amount of rote memorization.\r\n2) The massive amount of suffering you will endure DIRECTLY translates into the proudest possible feeling of accomplishment you will ever experience at Harvard. \r\n3) Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take this class unless Tyler Neill is TF-ing it. No one will work as hard as he to make sure you understand, and no one will be as patient. \r\n4) Pray.","I took this class for fun, and even though it required a lot of memorization and time spent reviewing concepts, the class was definitely worth it. The teaching staff are super nice, Alex and Tyler are more than willing to meet with you to go over ideas that you're struggling with!! If you're looking to satisfy the language requirement or have spots for an elective and are ready for a challenging but fun year, you should totally shop\/take this class :)","Sanskrit is a fun and beautiful language to study. Anyone interested in language will find first-year grammar conceptually ripe. It requires a good deal of effort, but the hard work is rewarding."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"3.80","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SANSKRIT 101b","course_id":"4749","cat_num":"6892","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SANSKRIT 101b","course_id":"4749","cat_num":"6892","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SANSKRIT 101b","course_id":"4749","cat_num":"6892","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"6","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
