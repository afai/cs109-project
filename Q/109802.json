The references and resources that Professor El-Rouayheb introduced to us alone were extremely valuable.","A challenging but worthwhile introduction to the Medieval Islamic intellectual tradition.","This course is a unique chance to learn some of the ins and outs of the Arabic rational sciences from one of the leading scholars in the field in a comfortable classroom setting.","That the course requires excellent Arabic, but not necessarily previous knowledge of this kind of texts. I would tell them that I feel my ability to read classical Arabic texts improved tremendously in this class, so patience and careful reading pays off. Moreover, Professor El-Rouayheb is very kind and the class is always an enjoyable experience one looks forward to each week.","Be open to reading texts outside of your central interests, because it is never a bad thing to broaden your horizons. Your efforts will be rewarded twofold."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ARABIC 243br","course_id":"11049","cat_num":"77091","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ARABIC 243br","course_id":"11049","cat_num":"77091","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ARABIC 243br","course_id":"11049","cat_num":"77091","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
