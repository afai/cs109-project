Our thoughts and questions travel freely between different disciplines, promoting a kind of will to movement: call it intellectual exhilaration! Media becomes an open problematic -- not just old tech like gramophones and radio towers but philosophical elements and liquids, sound, architectures, and drawings. Also notable for this course is how well it treats science studies from without the history of science program: the cross-disciplinary perspective in this regard is truly invaluable for FVS, I think. And, of course, I would have to mention Laura Frahm's general amazingness: her ability to relate and tune in to graduate student interests makes for a wonderful class dynamic. She constructed this class all around our grad student conference topic of \"process\" (with her help, a very special event for us)... it is no minor feat to interpret, solidify, and expand this ground of collective interest as she has with this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"4.00","difficulty":"4.30","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 241","course_id":"11287","cat_num":"86755","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 241","course_id":"11287","cat_num":"86755","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 241","course_id":"11287","cat_num":"86755","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
