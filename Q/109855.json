However, the information you learn in this class is unlikely to be useful in life, and sometimes making projects can be incredibly frustrating. You have to put some kind of artistic message in each project, and if your point doesn't get across to the TF grading, it will show in your grade.","Bad Gen Ed option because the grading is harsh. You may spend a lot of time on the projects but get a B.","Great class. Offers exposure to all kinds of material that is certainly rewarding.","Don't let the fact that it's an introductory course deter you from taking it.\r\nDon't let the fact that it's a humanities course deter you from taking it.\r\n\r\nToo often at Harvard, students discount courses for not being science-y or math-y enough or for not being rigorous enough. A sizable number of Harvard students might think of this course as a non-math-y, non-rigorous course. But you CANNOT let that deter you from taking it. There's simply too much to be learned from this class.\r\n\r\nIt will change the way to perceive the world. For the better. Don't miss out.","I would tell students to try to learn something new about the world around them and be as creative as they can when it comes to projects.","My favorite things about this course were the creative assignments and the section discussions. The creative projects, like making mixtapes or recording and composing sound pieces, were fun to do, and a nice complement to my essays and p-sets. In class discussions, we explored super philosophical questions and had debates on issues that changed the way I thought about the world around me. If you enjoy being observant, inquisitive, and insightful, take this class. (Or, if you want to make mixtapes and go on fun class excursions, that's cool too.)","- definitely take it if you loved listening to sound \/ music","It's very fun, start on projects early though and be creative","Definitely take this if you are thinking about concentrating in the humanities! It is also a good way to broaden your experiences and gain new skills, if you are in other departments.","This is an amazing class! I highly recommend it. Not too heavy work load, interesting section and very enjoyable assignments (very few papers).","Interesting class, lots of fun and thought provoking, although you never know where it'll take you next.  The readings are pretty doable, but make sure you plan out what you're going to do for the projects because if you leave them to the last minutes it will bite you in the behind.","Look at the syllabus closely and evaluate what traits you have that match the class before you take it. When the class is good, it's really good. When it's bad, it's really bad.","It's a fun course that allows you to experience things you otherwise wouldn't have a chance to.","This course is definitely for people who would enjoy creating artistic sound compositions on sound-editing software programs.","Do not underestimate the projects. They take a lot of time and sometimes require you to leave campus.","This class makes you think about sound, hearing, and listening in ways you probably have not before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.90","enrollment":"29","response rate":"93.10","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HUMAN 11b","course_id":"11008","cat_num":"69722","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"10","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HUMAN 11b","course_id":"11008","cat_num":"69722","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"19","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HUMAN 11b","course_id":"11008","cat_num":"69722","1s":"1","2s":"18","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
