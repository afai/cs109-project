'07":{"comments":["Not necessarily for everyone.  Recommend to people with strong interest in government, politics, or Russia in particular.","An excellent overview of Russian politics for those with little or no background on the subject or people who simply want to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.","The instructor did not organize a class discussion very well. The instructor just kept reading his memos during the lecture. The instructor did not show willingness to help students answer questions that he was not so familiar with."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["It's a good review of late Soviet and post Soviet political history, but it doesn't deal in much depth with contemporary political issues.","I would only recommend this course if it was amended to include more information on the Gorbachev period and less information about Yeltsin.","Nothing. Take this course.","This is a good introduction to Russian politics, although be warned that you really have to be interested in the topic or else it can get a bit dry at times. Prof. Colton's lectures are peppered with personal accounts of his meetings with Putin or Yeltsin (very entertaining) and are good overall, although we were always behind schedule, so if you are excited about topics at the end of the semester, plan to go through them quickly or not at all. The course gets better as the semester goes on, mainly because you come to know what is important to glean from lectures and readings as you become more acquainted with the subject."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Fun, easy, small.","I would highly recommend this class for students with some interest in post-Soviet politics. The class gives a great overview of Russia's troubles in the 1990's and its current status.","Best to take it as a grad student so you chan meet with Professor Colton during weekly section.","I would recommend this course highly to anyone interested in Russian politics, but probably not to anyone without this interest. Also, I would mention the poor organization of lectures in any recommendation I give.","Gov 1243 is a great gov class that focuses on a single case study. It offers a view into contemporary Russian politics which is subject that is usually overshadowed by Soviet history.","Read the readings! They are the core of the class. Sections build on them and lectures inform them. It is a great class to take if you have an interest in Russia or want to learn about principles political science applied under a competitive autocracy.","I felt the lectures for this class were very good and memorable. A lot of preparation obviously went into them. The sections were rather unfocused but we also had some good discussions. The readings were also helpful to understanding the topic.","Generally a good introduction to Russian politics. Readings are manageable. Try to read the Yeltsin book on time. It'll be difficult to catch it up later. Be prepared to study a lot of details, and fewer over-branching concepts. Professor Colton does tend to fall behind the lecture schedule, so expect to schedule a few additional classes to catch up."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you are interested in learning more about Russian politics, this would be a very rewarding course. If you do have a fairly extensive background, you might consider taking a more specialized course, perhaps, a seminar, instead of a lecture-based class (I believe prof. Colton will be offering one in the future).","If you are interested in Russia, its recent history or politics, this is a tremendous class. Definitely do the reading - it's not only useful and important but incredibly informative, so if you're interested int the subject matter thank Professor Colton for putting it together.","This class was an excellent overview of the intricacies of Russian politics, historical legacies that contribute to modern tendencies, and political theory. Be prepared for a substantial amount of reading.","I really liked this class - it'll be difficult if you don't have much government background, but you can clearly see that both the professor and TF are passionate about the subject and dedicated to teaching their students.","When i managed to do all the readings for the week, the classes for that week become more fun and you can relate more to what Prof. Colton was talking about. So do the readings! or try to do them!","so interesting; Professor Colton is so great - an amazing, engaging lecturer without even trying too hard (not an over-the-top display, but is genuinely so interested in the material that it is contagious); Nadiya is also wonderful - so helpful and her section is a great complement to the class","Don't take this class unless you are truly interested in the material. If you are, though, it will be fantastic. Yes, the organization is not spectacular and there isn't a huge amount of guidance with regards to assignments, but the reading list and chance to listen to\/talk with Colton is more than worth it.","Necessary foundation if pursuing work in Russian or Eurasian studies.","Keep up with the readings and participate in section. It is a great class if you are interested in Russia and want to get a lot out of the materials and Professor Colton (who is a great scholar)'s teaching. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in comparative politics or Russia.","If you want to learn Russian politics, this is the course for you."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It's a rare opportunity to take a class on Russian politics with a brilliant professor who has dedicated decades of his life studying the topic, is so enthusiastic about the subject matter, and who really cares about his students.","A great foundational course for Russian politics.","I thought that class got better as the semester went on.  Professor Colton is very sweet, the readings are interesting, and the material gets better as the class goes on.","If this is your interest, you learn quite a bit and can have an enjoyable experience doing so. Try not to bring your computer to class; the teaching style is somewhat dry and dense, so it's easy to get distracted if you allow yourself. But all in all, a good class as long as you're already interested.","you should be very enthusiastic about the subject already - the class is small so if you're not into it the course material may seem forced","This was one the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Professor Colton is extremely knowledgable and gives very interesting and engaging lectures. There is a lot of reading but it really helps to elaborate on general ideas discussed in the class. I definitely recommend this one!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a great course if you are interested in Russia. You are given a lot of information in lecture and readings and it is very enjoyable if you want to learn about the various aspects of Russian politics and society!","Speaking Russian helps, but not mandatory","The subject matter is really interesting, and Prof. Colton has a lot of cool stories to share. He's seen\/met a lot of the things\/people discussed in the class. The readings are manageable (never exceeded ~100 pp a week), and are well selected. Lectures can sort of drag on, but it's worth it.","This course is suitable for beginners and people already familiar with Russia alike. People of all experience levels are likely to get something positive out of the course.","A must if you're interested in global affairs and\/or Russia. Colton is great.","If you are even slightly interested in Russia take this course. If you are even slightly interested in government take this course. If you are even remotely curious about geopolitics today take this course. I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this course, and am walking away with a completely new understanding of the modern Russian Federation and its politics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"22","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1243","course_id":"2219","cat_num":"1982","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1243","course_id":"2219","cat_num":"1982","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"10","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1243","course_id":"2219","cat_num":"1982","1s":"1","2s":"10","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
