In fact, I loved it.","Choose Social Studies instead.","Forget Social Studies and it's cult-like tutorials, this is like a family...","I would recommend it only to people who are interested in sociological theory, or people that need to take it for a requirement.  While I thought it was a good class, if you don't like reading dense theory it would not be enjoyable.","This was my favorite course","As with most courses, you will get as much out of this course as you put into it. Doing the reading is essential.","Almost definitely the best tutorial I'll ever take."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["do the readings","I would tell them that it's fantastic. Many sophomores dread sophomore tutorials -but this one completely broke the stereotype. I'd tell them to really dig into the readings, and spend time getting to know their TF.","From what I've heard from people in other concentrations, this may be one of the most low-stress tutorials on campus","Its required of all sociology concentrators but from what I've heard isn't as hard as the other tutorials.  It is a tutorial that is relatively painless.","A good introduction to the big name social theorists; however, probably not of interest to people with a passing interest in sociology.","If you like discussions and actually can do the reading, this is a very engaging course that broadly covers some interesting sociological theory that still applies to contemporary society.","I would encourage them to stay up on the reading throughout the week. Because assignments were only due every two weeks, it was easy to put off the reading and fall behind, and then spend all Sunday night preparing for Monday class. Six to eight hours of theory reading all at once is insufferable!","This course can be burdensome at times but the discussion sections are interesting and help you to learn to like theory.","The course is an interesting course in terms of social theory. I would certainly recommend this course to non-sociology concentrators on the condition that they are interested in history and the changing social theories that have shaped human ideas about the development of human social structure.","The course can be really great, but I think it depends heavily on who your section leader is, because they each have so much autonomy in how they go about the subject matter.","This class is such a great foundation for sociological theory and the material you read and discuss are both worthwhile and engaging.","theory isn't terribly fun, but if you have a good tutorial group and a good TF, it isn't so bad.","If you are open to theory, and do the reading it is a good course.","I thought tutorial would be horrible and boring, but I had a great section leader (Kevin Lewis) and thoroughly enjoyed our discussions and debates in section.","The class allows students to gain a thorough understanding of sociological theory and teaches students how to effectively analyze theory and relate it to modern society.","The literature taught in Soc 97 comes up in virtually every sociology class at Harvard.  This is the base of knowledge for Soc concentrators.","I highly recommend this class; the readings were engaging and Ethan was a phenomenal TF.  He was clear, effective, engaging, highly knowledgeable and always available\/approachable."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Time-consuming, but very interesting and fun.","This course is a really great introduction to several different modes of thought and will challenge you but be extremely rewarding.","Do the reading before class and don't wait until the last minute to start the paper.","This course is useful and interesting, but it requires a lot of reading and writing.","This class is tough and theory is probably scary for most of you, but this class will definitely make you more able to take it head on in the future. Highly recommended.","Be ready to work and think.  Think a lot.","Great introduction to sociological theory and you finish with a good knowledge of how to use theory to help you do real sociological research.  That said, if you don't like sociology, this will be pretty miserable.  Some of it is even when you do.","I would recommend this class, but would say that a lot depends on who they have as a TF. Mine was fantastic, but yours may not be."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It is a fairly painless introduction to sociological theory.","I would say you should only take this class if it's required for your concentration, and getting a good TF makes or breaks the class.","Sociology is a manageable and interesting major, and sophomore tutorial lives up to this billing.","Be prepared to read a lot but also to get a good foundation in sociological theory.","I discovered I enjoyed sociological theory much more than I thought I would!","As a required tutorial, it's fine but I would not take it as an elective.","It's a lot of work (essays and readings) and to make sure you get a good TF for the course.","This class was amazing. It was definitely a lot of work but, honestly, very worth it. I'd say 90% of the readings are intriguing and applicable, and for the 10% that's not, we didn't focus so much on them. This class makes you think about yourself and life differently.","It's a difficult course but you learn a lot from it.","Only take this class if you are going to major or have a secondary in sociology.","A lot of readung, but not as dry as the list first appears.","This is a theory course. Be sure about your dedication to you concentration or be sure that you have an interest in theory before enrolling. This was by far the most difficult class I have taken because I disagreed with so much of the material, which made it extremely challenging to complete five papers for the class.","Email your tf your paper outlines before writing your papers.","It is a lot of work but necessary and can be fun if you write about what interests you.","Plan your essays well because they will come in rapid succession.","This tutorial was extremely helpful and enjoyable, and I would encourage anyone considering a concentration in sociology to look into taking this class, as it strongly reaffirmed my interest in sociology.","Speed reading","it is much more interesting and less tedious than you expect and it is not necessary to do all of the readings","It requires a lot of work and effort every week.","It's tough, but rewarding.","Find outlines or notes for the readings- don't read the primary sources.","Take this course if you know you want to concentrate in sociology.  This is a poor indication of what most other sociological courses offered are like.","There's a lot of reading within this course. I would advise them to talk to their TF to try and get pointers on which passages\/ideas to focus on while reading.","It is a good introduction to sociological theory. The texts are very dense making readings often difficult.","This class is strongly theory based. Take that as you wish","Your imagination and the way you perceive the world changes after taking this class.","get chana if you take this course...she is the bomb","Theory is not as bad as many people make it out to be.  It's really quite interesting.  You'll see things under a different light.","Always do the readings and think about it how it applies to you every day.","This class requires time.

I was a little bit nervous for it at first, but I ended up loving it!","The small class and discussion heavy format break down the theory and make it easy to understand. It wasn't dry at all-- actually my favorite class this semester!","Tough but worth it.  You will learn so much!","Social Studies students should strongly consider taking this course, because it provides the more empirical side of what many of them take for granted.  In particular, the models of social interaction and cognition are something which social studies students gloss over in favor of the \"sexier\" topics.","take it if interested in basic theory","This class gives you a good overview and foundation of what sociology is based in so you can understand where your feelings and opinions about issues come from.  The readings are really difficult at times and I often had to rely heavily on summaries.  There's huge differences in TFs and sections and some classes will get really in depth and others will do a great job making sure you understand the really important parts that are totally necessary to know.  The reading is the hard part though.  Don't be scared by the papers.  The topics are broad and leave you a lot of freedom to pick something you actually care about.  I literally lost my phone and decided to write about the sociological theory behind a blackberry.  I loved writing my papers.","I would not recommend you take this unless you are a sociology concentrator","Try to get Chris -- not only is a great TF in general, but if you ever had doubts about sociology, he'll show you why those concerns are often unfounded.","I cannot stress enough how much Eleni helped clarify concepts. The reading is also very manageable for this class. There is tons of support!","If you're a soc. concentrator you gotta take it.  If you're interested in sociological theory but not a concentrator, you absolutely should take it.","The course is extremely interesting and you leave class thinking about the issues you discussed in section.  Ultimately, the class makes the topics buried in the readings come to life.","Great class that allows sociological theory to enter conversations of one's everyday life.","I would tell students that this course is a great opportunity to really explore theory and find out how it relates to the world.","Yes! Usually students think about sophomore tutorials as very difficult and something they just have to get through. I found this course to be exactly the opposite. It was the class I enjoyed the most this semester!","lots of reading, writing assignments are manageable, difficult to do well without doing all of the reading.","Don't let the word theory scare you.","The sections are a perfect way to clarify the readings and are a great environment to explore one's ideas.  I had a really great time talking in section and trying to figure out my sociological outlook.","Beware, the response papers are graded extremely hard, harder than normal response papers...","Overall fun class if you put time and effort into it. It can be very rewarding. I learned alot about social theory and now see the world differently."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["You get as much out of this class as you choose to. You can slack off and not do any reading and probably get through just fine, but you can really challenge yourself with the material and do the assigned reading and you will learn a lot. Get involved in discussion. Ask lots of questions!","This class is very interesting, just be prepared to do a lot of reading, and discuss the material frequently in section. Some of the material is quite dense, but reach out to your teaching fellow for assistance if you find it difficult to understand.","The readings are almost exclusively from dead white men.","You have to be interested in sociology","You will not receive much help on your papers.","Great way to build a solid foundation in sociology.","This class is not as difficult as it sounds, but you should genuinely be interested in the subject to like this course.","You have to take it for the concentration.","Great for covering all the foundational texts","Christopher is awesome!","You can learn a lot about theorists and read about famous figures who are often mentioned in many academic disciplines. You will really enjoy reading them and discussing them. One of the strengths of this course is the fact that you get to apply the theories you learn to real-life examples and develop your own explanation about a phenomenon! This is an amazing course.","You don't really have an option if you're a sociology concentrator but it's a good class to take in any case. Not scintillating, but informative.","A highly-informative class with a very doable workload coupled with terrific TFs.  I certainly recommend it with enthusiasm.","Good reading, lecture was not always fun","Provides a good foundation for sociological study that is also applicable in many other areas of study. Even though it is based in theories, it is still interesting","I wouldn't recommend it if you didn't have to take it, but since all concentrators do, there's no point in wishful thinking. Although all the TFs say you have to do all the reading, thats not necessarily true, you can get by if you just do one and get brief summaries and quotes from the others or understand the overall concept. Also, ask people the years before you who the best TF is.","take it with Chris!","Sociology is really awesome, as evidenced by their fantastic tutorial. Some readings are more interesting than others, of course, but you learn about many really thought-provoking ideas. It's a very fun and comfortable environment too, which I found very important as well. I felt very comfortable asking questions and making comments in class. The two long papers you write are really fun and rewarding too...you can write on anything you want, which leaves a lot of room for you to develop your own, unique ideas.","This class was actually very enjoyable. My class only had 5 students in it so it allowed us to have thorough discussions and encouraged everyone to participate equally. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you can, get Chris Muller! He's great! His section is very entertaining and he's very accessible outside of class. Trust me, you'll love him!","the theories are SO interesting!","Make sure you do your readings.","Difficult but interesting and helpful","This is a great choice although mandatory it will change the way you think about how society and individuals in general.","you'll learn so much and be challenged to think about life\/society through the lens of various interesting\/historic characters. really engaging and really applicable to everything around us."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["some of the readings are really difficult to get through, but the tfs are amazing and help you out so much. for a two-hour class, it's definitely one of the less miserable ones.","If you're engaging the material it will challenge your ideas. It's definitely a great tutorial that is open to people with different interests in sociology.","This is a great class even for any social science concentrator, not just sociology. It provides the kind of insight and framework with which to examine many social science phenomenons.","If you are at all considering sociology, wavering, sure of it, anything, take this class and it will convince you whether or not sociology is for you! If you choose to concentrate in Sociology or not, you will leave with such a thorough understanding of the founding fathers of this social science that there is no way you could regret it!","This class really does focus on theory and not as much on real-world applications, which is a shame considering how much sociology relies on contemporary applications. You might feel a bit in over your head with lengthy reading assignments but they will be clarified in section so don't feel like you have to read all. Chris was extremely willing to meet to discuss papers and concepts, so if you have questions talk to him!","OMG this class was so awesome! I feel in love with sociology, without really being decided on my concentration beforehand.","Chris is the best!  Was definitely one my favorite classes of the 12 I've taken in my time here.","the best course I have taken at harvard","Take this class if you're interested in sociology as a secondary or concentration. It's a very good introduction to the major theorists. Also, Chris is an amazing TF. He explains things very well.","This class was really fantastic.  I enjoyed all of the material and the papers are fun to write.","It will change the way you think about the world.","It is not as painful as you would expect. The assingments were \"fun\" (in the sense that no assignments are fun but these are relatively painless while provide you whit a good outlet to demonstrate your knowledge of the material.)","This class was absolutely fantastic! The subject matter was very interesting and made discussions fascinating rather than painful. The reading was difficult, but the TFs did a wonderful job making each concept easily understandable.","The reading is somewhat boring and I thought it was pretty difficult to understand. Eleni is an amazing TF and I can't imagine what this course would have been like without her! She is so helpful and made class really fun. Some of the theories are pretty interesting once she explained them. The response papers aren't too hard and they definitely help once you have to write the final paper. The final paper is just relating the theories to any phenomenon in your life so you can make it interesting and it's not too bad to write.","You can write about what you love!","This course confuses you and will make you think very deeply about pretty much everything. You will realize sometime during the semester that your other friends do not walk around thinking about these things constantly. There is a lot of reading, but do it, because that's what the course is based on. If you don't do them you will be lost, and will not be able to write your papers. Don't think that you have to sound intellectual in class--the language to discuss these theories will come naturally as you are more exposed to the materials in general. Finally, participate--you're there for 2 hours a week, and might as well make it an engaging experience for both you and your TF.","This the best social science class that I have taken here. I wish I could take it before I took my gov class because it was so helpful in ways beyond the content of the material. I really learned a lot in this class and loved the experience.","You might be afraid of having to take a theory class as a requirement for sociology but Sociology 97 was a fantastic course! They really did their best in structuring the course and sections so that you not only come away understanding the theory but can apply it to contemporary issues. Chris was such a great TF and really made the class so fun and interesting. Definitely a great class to take for the concentration!","Mostly that it was the TF that made this class captivating for me. The information is, of course, interesting, but I felt that the Eleni was crucial in helping me understand the ins and outs of the theories.","It is a requirement so you have to take it. You will learn many things by the end of the course and once in a while the sociological theories will pop up in your other classes or random sociology articles you find online. Also ask for Eleni as your TF!","I was pretty sure I was going to hate a tutorial on sociological theory, but I loved it. The small class size and the relaxed atmosphere is great, and it means that everyone is there to learn; not impress others or show how much they already know. Eleni was fantastic (and I hear Chris is great too), and you really feel like you get to know the people in your tutorial and your TF.","Do not be discouraged by the readings. They seem to be overwhelming at first but you can see your theory reading skills dramatically improve over time. Class notes really help cement the points that you may have missed in your own readings so pay attention. Christopher Muller is the man!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It is a very interesting class that makes you think in depth.","Some of the readings are dense, but they are really interesting once you break them down in class and understand them better through class discussion.  The papers are interesting too because you get to pick your own topics pretty much.","I really enjoyed this class and felt that I learned a lot; a lot of the theories are absolutely fascinating and quite brilliant, and the exposure to these theories was extremely formative in many of my opinions about the legitimacy of sociology as a discipline. A word of caution, however: this class totally depends on which TF you get. My experience varied tremendously from those of other students\/friends with different TFs. My TF happened to be very strict with deadlines and refused to give extensions for extremely legitimate reasons, while other TFs gave universal deadlines for nearly every paper to all of the students in their sections. Therefore, be very careful about your TF assignment and certainly look into switching if you initially have doubts.","You got a much better understanding of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim and learn more about the contemporary theorists.","this is a great class! really teaches you how to understand and appreciate sociology and theory. i was scared going into the course, but the readings were broken down really well by the tf's and you really realize how great and interesting this field is","It's important to start the weekly readings early on because they take a very long time.","This class really guides you through the theory; it was really helpful with my other classes.","I loved this class! There was a lot of reading at points, but it was all explained in section. I ended the semester feeling like I learned a lot of theory.","You learn so much. A really enriching class here","This course is the best tutorial you will take - enjoy it!","I wouldn't necessarily take it if you're not a concentrator, but don't dread it either. Theory can be fun!","Be prepared to work hard and read dense material but if you put in work you will become a much better analyst and writer.","This is a great introduction to social theory.  You'll be exposed to a number of the \"great\" thinkers of western social thought and be exposed in a very digestible way.  I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in social theory.","It is essential to do the readings for this course as well as take detailed notes. It is much easier to write the papers and participate in class if you have already selected evidence that you would like to examine and\/or discuss.","It's a requirement for sociology concentrators and it is difficult, but still manageable","Sociological theory is more interesting that you would think. Concentrate on getting the main arguments and methodologies from each theorists instead of trying to read through all of the material. The shorter papers are really helpful for the long ones!","If you're not a Soc concentrator, don't take it.","A lot of reading but you don't need to read everything word for word. The only time where it helps to read word for word is during the Marx unit (first one).","A lot of (often unnecessary) reading; otherwise, an excellent course.","I loved this class. Eleni was the best!","Although you may be apprehensive about reading theory, this class is great. There was a lot of reading, but if you put the time into it, you learn a lot about the foundations of sociology. If Eleni is teaching it, make sure you take it with her.","You'll only get out of this class what you put in.","I learned a lot from this course. It covers material vital to any discussion of the social sciences and generated enthusiasm for me to study sociology. I like the way section in structured. It gives you time to complete readings and you don't have to worry about lecture and section in the same week.","Really does give you an excellent base understanding of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim and of contemporary theorists as well. I feel like I can actually have a conversation about these people and hold my ground now! When assigned your TF, take a moment to ask around about their styles to people who have taken the course. They can differ a lot in difficulty, strictness, and approach so if you know your own learning style well than you might want to think about that...","Soc97 is one of the great classes where you truly see the results of your effort. In the process of developing critical thinking skills and learning how to write cogently, I put in a lot of effort, and derived as much or greater value. Being a member of the sophomore tutorial was a really rewarding experience- take this class with Vaughn!!","You will gain so much from this class. Keep up with the readings. The last two assignments seem daunting, but they're actually really fun.","This class is a requirement, so for those of you who have to take it, I am sorry. It is a hard course, especially if you have never written theory papers before. If you embrace the class for what it is, it can be enjoyable at times. Just find some aspect or some theorist that is really interesting to you, and dive into it. The class becomes much more enjoyable this way.","Given that this class is a requirement for sociology, the class is excellent, the tfs are excellent; they go through a rigorous interview process to get the position, and they are super helpful and if you put effort into this class you will write and think better. But, if you don't care, you can easily pass this class with minimal work, but I do recommend getting into the course because it's pretty rewarding.","It's not as bad as you might think"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["1) Danilo is an amazing TF. Learning from him could be a reason to take the class if he's teaching it.\r\n2) You learn so much, and you look at the world in so many new ways.","This course may require a lot more work in terms of time spent dissecting readings and time spent crafting thoughtful papers, but it is incredibly rewarding. It may also be one of the only times in Sociology that you can focus purely on social theory, which may be intimidating at first, but provides for a great experience!","Wonderful class. Theory is surprisingly enjoyable","Great class that changes the way you look at the world. Really fascinating topic (looking at everything around us in an intellectual way!) and the teaching is great.","It was a great course that may seem intimidating at first but is actually a class rich in interesting sociology topics. Plus, T.F.s are really awesome and always willing to help! Don't procrastinate on the papers though!","If you're at all interested in sociological theory, this is the course to take. Fair syllabus and challenging (but entirely manageable) coursework.","Do not let the amount of reading intimidate you. It is covered extensively in section and you will not be expected to interpret the works of major theorists on your own.","THis class is hard but worth it.  I extremely enjoyed it. The discussions were really interesting and I learned a lot.  My TF was great at teaching the material and giving feed back","Even though this is a requirement, i think it's a great class for anyone interested in social theory and it is organized and taught very well. It isn't an easy class, but it's worth putting the time into.","Use outside resources to help understand material","This class is incredible. Many people complain about theory, but the TFs know how to present the material in a way that makes you at least appreciate what Marx, Durkheim, Weber and others are saying. You must do the readings though as they supplement and facilitate most of the learning that happens in section.","Theory can be tough, but you'll learn a lot from both your TF and your classmates. It's a great course, considering it's a requirement for all concentrators!","Its a lot of work and readings to comprehend, but the TFs are there to help every step of the way. I wouldn't take such a consuming course as an elective, though- only take if needed for one's concentration or secondary field.","Chana is the most incredible TF I've had yet. Her understanding of theory is amazing and she is extremely patient. She taught us with ease and patience; her discussions were engaging and helped us to understand the materials.","you have to take it--make sure you know what your TF wants! Your papers depend on their opinions over yours.","dull reading"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a great class, especially with Eleni as the TF. The reading and theory seemed really daunting at first, but she helped make it manageable and fun.","This class is interesting if you want to learn about sociological theory.  It is very well-taught.  The TFs are great.  I personally would not have taken it if not for my sociology secondary requirement.","Be prepared for huge amounts of reading covered all at once in a good but long section.","Spend time with the theorists and they'll teach you a lot, even if you don't always agree with them. :)","Make sure you do all the readings and look to secondary sources in order better understand the texts.","I would say that it is a great class, especially if you do not know much about sociology.","This class requires a lot of dense reading, but some interesting applications to the real world are also discussed. The reading and discussions will change the way you see the world, but it also takes a lot of work. If you put in the effort and time necessary, this class will be rewarding. I would be cautious about recommending this class to non-concentrators. It's worthwhile if you will have time to put into it, but don't add it if it won't be one of your main focuses for the semester.","This class is a requirement, but is also my favorite class at Harvard so far! While I came in to this class dreading the theory component of the concentration, I came out of it with a new-found appreciation for theory and its usefulness.","Lots of reading, but pay attention in section and you should be fine.","This course isn't easy and the readings are challenging, but it's a good introduction to a wide range of sociological theory. Your experience really depends on the TF, though - Jonathan was a good TF and cared about the material and his students, but I've heard that others are a bit more excited about the readings + making them interesting to their students.","I'd recommend this course even to non-concentrators. Eleni is great and you learn a new way of understanding the world. Readings are skippable. Just do enough to say intelligent things in section and to write a stellar essay, cause that's where most of your grade comes from.","I loved it! Especially in the fall because we only had 5 people and we got really close and it was very easy to discuss things you didn't understand. It seemed daunting at first but the TFs are chill and really seek to make you understand what's going on.","Engaging with social theory is an important way to learn new ways to think critically about the world around you. This course is a great way to learn some of the main theorists and frameworks, as well as the appropriate ways to apply them. Not an overwhelming reading load, as social studies 10 is...you can actually read and engage with all of the theory you are required to read for this class."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class was very interesting. I especially liked the classical theorists because it wasn't difficult to remember who wrote what. Stefan is an amazing TF. He knows what the class covers very well and that helps when you don't understand some parts of the readings since they were written so long ago and are sometimes convoluted. He really engaged my section and there was never a moment of silence in my section due to lack of participation. He also replies to emails promptly, which helps when you have last minute questions about an assignment.","it was interesting, definitely not that bad of a class even for non sociologist concentrations or secondaries","Stefan is an awesome TF! He is knowledgable, open to new ideas, and approachable. This course is a lot of information in not much time, so I can say I learned a lot and enjoyed the two hour one time a week section. Because the sections are small, the people in your section also really help to shape your experience. There is a lot of reading and the essay grading is fair, but that doesn't mean easy. Overall, if is a concentration requirement that I enjoyed and that provides a really good basis for understanding social phenomena.","Be prepared to do the readings and be able to discuss at least some of them in great detail.","This class is theory intensive. The writing assignments are graded meticulously, and the shortcoming I found with the syllabus arrangement is that there is little time spent detailing the writing style expectations prior to submitting the first assignment. The readings do not reflect the style of concise, direct writing expected in the course, and this dissonance often proved challenging. Also, I found the theory component to be somewhat despairing and morbid at times, particularly the first six weeks of the class during which we essentially debate whether or not we feel humanity is controlled by their economic system. It is at times off-putting and in-accessible subject matter.","You are going to have fun. The staff is top notch. Don't worry at all.","I assume you are taking this class for a Sociology concentration. It's alright. Not the most exciting of classes. I didn't enjoy it very much but that's because theory bores me. It's just something you have to get past in order to get to where you want to be.","It is a very engaging, fun, and awesome class where you learn a lot.","Be very organized with readings!","It is really helpful to do all your reading and start the large paper early. i think that the TFs are all really accessible so if you ever feel like you don't understand a concept please feel free to email them.","Theory can be boring, but looking back, this class is actually quite enjoyable and probably one of the less painless ways of learning theory. Definitely take it in the fall if you can because there are fewer students and sections are smaller."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is likely to be the best course that you take at Harvard.","Take this class as your first sociology class. It lays a great foundation toward learning in other sociology classes.","do the reading and participate in section, and you will get a lot out of this course","To my surprise, Soc. 97 actually ended up being my favorite class of the semester. While I initially had hesitations about a class focused on theory, I came out of the class with a great appreciation for what we had learned. Stefan was an incredible TF who found the best methods to teach the course to best fit our needs.","Like other Sociology concentrators, I was really dreading this course. It's theory after all. I don't know what the other sections were like, but I have to say Alvaro really made this section my favorite class of the semester. I think that's pretty awesome for a required class. Anyway, the things I liked about this class was that it didn't matter whether I had done the reading or not, by the time I left Alvaro's section I always understood exactly whatever that week's theorist was saying. His sections were fun not only because they're small, but Alvaro would include pop culture references (Miley Cyrus, the Matrix, etc) in order to make the material more accessible. I also really enjoyed that I was able to pick my topics for the two big papers we had to write. Overall it was a really awesome experience.","It is a lot of work, but if you apply yourself you can enjoy it. Theory isn't as dry as it seems.","The readings are dense, but this course does an excellent job of breaking down the readings and helping you to make sense of the material. I wish I had taken this course earlier on, because writing papers and understanding the materials of other sociology courses would have been so much easier after taking this course.","Important class to fully understand Sociology and learn how to analyze theorists.","be read to be confused, but also relate the theories to organizations and events currently going on - makes it more interesting and useful","This class totally brought out the theory nerd in me. I learned sooo much - made me remember why I'm a sociology concentrator and why I fell in love with the field in the first place. Also, Alvaro is the best TF - he broke everything down so that it was understandable and connected everything to present day. He also gave great feedback\/advice on papers!","Do all the reading, it will be very helpful when it comes time to write the papers. They take much less time\/effort to write if you have done the reading. Also take good notes in class!! That is very very helpful.","The readings are difficult at times, but it is interesting to see the social world through different lenses.","Very thorough sociology class.","Stefan is the best Tf to get. Paper heavy class but they are spaced out well.","Absolutely loved this class. While the summary essays can be a little different than most college assignments because they're only summary instead of thinking about it, the last two essays allow you to pick your own topic and how the class applies to it. Overall a great, relatively chill class that really provides a sound foundation for sociology","This class is incredible if you put in the effort. For those who are passionate about social issues, this provides a theoretical lens through which to do just that.","While this class is challenging, the theories are really interesting. The instructors are really good about helping you work through these theories and think critically about how they can apply to more general sociological phenomena. The amount of writing also helps you to learn how to implement these theories into your writing. THere's a lot of room to improve. Overall it was a great course!","This is the most intellectually engaging and exciting class I have taken at Harvard so far, and for that reason, it has been my favorite class. It is certainly very stimulating, and not for those looking for an easy A or a boring discussion. I loved this class! You must seriously do the readings, and participate in section. Otherwise, you will not get much out of this class.","This was great. DO IT.","lots of reading, writing, and discussion"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you're taking this class, it's because you have to. Some of the readings are kind of dense (like Marx), but you have plenty of time to go over everything in section, and the assignments are very straightforward.","Very solid, manageable course that gives you a good theory foundation.","Your experience is partially dependent on your TF. I can't speak to the other TFs' abilities, but Nathan was great. Otherwise, the course is basically self-taught, as sections are mostly used to go over material you are expected to learn by yourself. If you're interested in sociology, it is a very rewarding class. The workload is also fair, and the content of the reading is valuable.","Please take this class if you think you are interested in Sociology. If you are unsure of concentrating in sociology, take the class. Ignore its status as a \"requirement.\" Had I known the class would be this good I would have taken it as an elective regardless. Great readings, great papers, great TF's.","This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard! Although it's taught by TF's, TF's are actually more likely to be approachable in terms of explaining the material- they've learned it recently enough that they know how best to help you understand the concepts.","This course is more rigorous than your average Sociology course, but I found this refreshing. The readings are interesting, and necessary for any Soc concentrator to read, and the teaching staff care deeply about it. You'll learn a lot.","This course is very challenging but it will help you deeply understand sociological theory.","Fantastic introductory knowledge to key philosophy\/sociology.","This is a great class that will give you a better understanding of social theorists.  Even if you cannot finish every reading, I would recommend trying to read most of them each week because the discussion are interesting and illuminating.  I am more confident about concentrating in Sociology after this course.","This course is a lot of work, but it is a grea the t class. Such a small class allows you to work through difficult theories. If you do all the reading, you will get a lot out of the class.","Don't worry about having to work with difficult material; everything is explained, and discussions will make things very clear.  Your TF and the writing fellow are also very willing to discuss paper topics with you.  As long as you put in the work for the course and make an effort to understand the readings, the other students and your TF will help you fill in the gaps in your knowledge."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"19","response rate":"84.21","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 97","course_id":"4633","cat_num":"5079","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 97","course_id":"4633","cat_num":"5079","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"23","4s":"11","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 97","course_id":"4633","cat_num":"5079","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
