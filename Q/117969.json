'08":{"comments":["Dr. Groopman is an incredible professor and mentor.  He is an inspiring individual and brings so much enthusiasm to the class.  He is the most sincere and honest teacher I have ever encountered.","If you get a chance to take this class, it will be one of the best experiences of your freshman year.","Dr. Groopman is the most engaging, informative and lively teacher I have had so far at Harvard.  The way he carries the class is phenomenal; I would recommend this class to anyone.","This seminar was the bright center of every week. Dr. Groopman is fascinating and getting to know him was exciting and I learned more and more broadly than I have in any other class. I feel so lucky to have taken this seminar.","DO YOUR READING!  Class goes better when you do and your discussions are better if everyone is (literally) on the same page.  Also, ask Groopman for time to discuss amongst yourselves!  If last year is anything like this year, you guys are all interesting and fascinating in and of yourselves: get to know each other and discuss, talk, debate, and converse.  You all along with Dr. Groopman are incredible resources (oh Harvard speak...).","Enjoy spending so much time with such a distinguished and accomplished man.  It is extremely worth your while if you do all the readings."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["An excellent scope into the compassionate care of the sick.","One of the best classes I've taken. Dr. Groopman is an interesting professor and a fun guy. The reading is engaging, class discussions are active, and you'll end up taking a lot away from the course.","as long as you like reading books and talking about medicine, this class will be AMAZING!  dr g is the coolest professor ever","There are moments with great insight on writing, but if you want to take it for the opportunity to talk about writing, it may not be the discussion you were exactly looking for.  But if you have a pre-mad interest, for sure.","This class is inspiring. The professor is amazingly warm, learned and reassuring.","Most any pre-med at Harvard can be a doctor. This class is the first step in learning how to be a good one."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["best class i've taken all of freshman year","Dr. Groopman is the best teacher you will ever have.  The topics discussed in this class force you outside of your comfort zone.  The readings and discussions are literally life-changing, in a positive way.","If you have the chance to take this seminar, take it. You'll learn SO MUCH about everything in life (not even exaggerating). Plus, Dr. Groopman is just a really amazing person and it is great to get to know more about him. However, you should be interested in the material before taking this class since you will be reading a lot and writing a lot (in comparison to other freshman seminars). Just know going into this class that you WILL have more work than your friends in other seminars, but it is well worth it!","An absolutely wonderful seminar; a humanistic introduction to the illness experience through literature.  Dr. Groopman is truly inspiring, and for any potential premeds, this class will teach to become a better caregiver: something few classes do at Harvard.","I loved the class! Dr. Groopman is a great guy and if you get the opportunity to take this, take it!","Awesome class, one of my favorite this semester. Dr. Groopman is simply amazing.","This seminar was one of the best experiences of my freshman year. I loved all of the readings, the writing assignments, and most of all, Dr. Groopman and my classmates. I learned about medicine through a personal, literary lens. This seminar focuses more on the many different relationships between physician and patient, as well as the physician and himself. Very interesting and eye-opening. I highly recommend this seminar!","write your essays early","Unbelievable class with an unbelievable teacher.","It has been my favorite class so far at Harvard. The small environment of the freshman seminar makes the class very engaging. You get to develop a personal relationship with the other students and Dr. Groopman. Dr. Groopman is a very interesting teacher who doesn't let you get away with not engaging in the material, which is very helpful, and makes the class better."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is pretty much a class about how to change your life. Thought-provoking, informative, fun, amazing, truly AWESOME!","Please take it! Dr. Groopman is a wonderful professor and you'll look forward to every class!","This is a spectacular freshman seminar taught by an outstanding, dynamic and kind professor. Dr. Groopman, an accomplished physician and author, shares his insights during lively, thought-provoking class discussions and encourages and facilitates active student participation. The assigned readings are engaging and eye-opening. Taking this course will increase your sensitivity towards others who are grappling with illness and serious health issues, and you will gain, among other things, a better understanding of the human aspect of the doctor-patient relationship and ethical issues that arise in medicine. Be prepared to do all the required readings so that you can get the most out of this amazing class and fully take part in class discussions.","I cannot recommend this class highly enough. This seminar was the highlight of my freshman year; I wish I could take it again. The only downside of this class is that no other class will be able to measure up.  Jerome Groopman personifies teaching excellence. He is intelligent and accomplished, but also warm, funny and friendly. I looked forward to class every week. If you pass up this course, you are making a mistake.","I loved this class. It was definitely the best part of my freshman year. Take the class! Be prepared to do the readings and write the essays thoughtfully -- you'll want to spend the time on them, because the class draws you in unlike anything I've taken before.","If you're interesting in active discussion and you enjoy reading medical literature, this is the seminar for you. Professor Groopman will help you think in ways you've never thought before, and you will learn so much from him and this class. If you enjoy learning for the sake of learning, take this seminar!","Jerome Groopman is a rockstar! Take this seminar if you want to really think and discuss medicine critically and through literature. Having the opportunity to get his feedback on your writing is also extremely valuable - take every assignment seriously and do all the readings. Totally worth it!!!","This was my favorite class of the semester. I am a premed student and was always stressed with my science classes, but this seminar gave me a few hours of fun, stimulating and stress-free learning each week. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in medicine, physicians and\/or literature."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class is awesome. If you have any slight interest in medicine, health, or philosophical questions about life, TAKE THIS SEMINAR. You would be lucky to get to be in Dr. G's class. He is a great person and a brilliant guy.","I cannot recommend this class strongly enough!","This course is the best class I have taken so far at Harvard.  It is such an honor to learn from someone as knowledgeable and kind as Professor Groopman, let alone get to know him on an intimate level.  The course material is so interesting and Professor Groopman line edits every piece of writing you submit.  This opportunity is truly unique.","It is actually the greatest course at all of Harvard, no joke.","This seminar is life-changing. Amazing stories, amazing classmates, amazing professor. If you're interested in medicine, or humanity, you'll love it. Dr. G is so funny, warm, and wise that this will be your best course at Harvard.","This class is undoubtedly my favorite class this semester and might be my favorite class of all time! Sign up for this seminar, and if you get in, take it! Dr. Groopman is an AMAZING professor. He is knowledgeable about practically everything, but more importantly, he a really kind person (he even brings cookies to every class!). We got to read all sorts of fascinating medical literature (ranging from The Death of Ivan Ilych to Groopman's own book), and class discussions were always interesting with Dr. Groopman's keen insights.","It's basically a very straightforward class. If you're very interested in doing a seminar, this is certainly an option. You don't have to be pre-med or an English concentrator to enjoy this class. The reading material is great for the most part (although some of the short stories get very repetitive); House of God and Everyman are really fantastic and thought-provoking. Dr. G's book is insanely impressive because you can tell how talented he is not just in medical practice, but in writing. He's really a good person to know and a very supportive mentor. I did grow a little weary of the structure of the actual class. I wasn't a huge fan of Dr. G's style of teaching, and I sort of thought our discussion of each week's reading material was very unfocused and not exactly what I was expecting in terms of themes and whatnot.","Dr. G is amazing-- intelligent, witty, sincere. Don't miss this opportunity :)","The most interesting class I've ever taken. Dr. Groopman is a genius. The most intelligent, insightful, and personable teacher I've had. If anyone is striving to become a physician, he is the kind of doctor you aspire to be. He's incredible and so is this class.","This seminar is a challenging, provocative, and ultimately immensely rewarding experience.  You will be pushed in many ways, and even when you don't agree, you'll grow as a writer, a thinker, and a person."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you have the opportunity, take this course without hesitation. It has been one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Harvard. Dr. Groopman is both an amazing professor and a wonderful human being. He really puts effort into editing our written work and is incredibly knowledgeable about topics ranging from medicine to literature to history. Plus, he brings cookies to every seminar meeting!","Dr. Groopman is very committed to each student and improving their writing. He also wants to impart his vast knowledge on anyone that is willing to learn.","Dr. Groopman knows information about practically everything, but besides his vast amount of knowledge, he is an amazing writer and professor. He takes the time to be available to his students. And he brings snacks to every seminar.","Take this course if at all possible. Dr. G is one of the most incredible professors and people you will meet at Harvard. His knowledge is beyond extensive, and he is kind and fair in his approach to teaching. Every Wednesday I left inspired and eager to do the work for next week.","This is once in a lifetime course. Dr. Groopman is one of the most fascinating people I've ever met and every session is filled with interesting tidbits that he's picked up. The texts are amazing and although there's a good amount of writing and reading it's so interesting that I didn't mind at all. I can't recommend this course any more and anyone would be lucky to even meet Dr. Groopman much less spend 2 hours a week with him.","Dr. Groopman will amaze you with his mind and his caring nature. He pushes you to think in new ways, to challenge beliefs you had previously taken for granted, and he does all this while still supporting you and keeping a smile on your face. You will walk out of this class hoping to one day understand the world as well as he does. This is not an easy freshman seminar, but the work shapes you and enlightens you.","Dr. G is amazing. Take this class without a doubt. While it is only a freshman seminar and has no grade, you might find yourself going out of your way to do more work because the class is that awesome, and you don't want to look stupid in front of Dr. G. Seriously, he is really friendly, but he is super smart. He knows things about every imaginable subject, including Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson (he's funny too). While he is not intimidating, you still might be intimidated by him because he is that awesome. Best class I took this year, hands down.","By far the best class of my freshman year, and I can't imagine having a better time in a seminar class than I did in this one. Dr. Groopman is hilarious and seems to know everything there is to know, and the writing prompts and readings he assigns are always very interesting. Even with the ~800 word per week writing component, the course was generally pretty easy, and as a pass\/fail course it helped to balance my schedule. Be warned though: Dr. Groopman's line edits are enough to keep anyone from slacking off. Also, Patterson, New Jersey is the hummus capital of the world.","This course will change your life! Dr. Groopman is one of the most inspiring and knowledgeable teachers I've ever had."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This seminar is interesting and engaging.  Dr. Groopman has so much to share with his students, and I looked forward to going to class every week.","You get a very comprehensive overlook on patient-doctor\/ medicine related matters from the humanitarian perspective. We handled everything from literature (Tolstoy, Chekov etc) to journals written by medical personnel, to op-eds and patient accounts. By writing an op-ed every week we were able to fully ruminate each lecture and topic and form our own opinion. I was really able to think about issues that are not often discussed in everyday life despite our frequent encounter with doctors. I was able to really think about the patient-doctor relationship and consider how important that is, apart from a doctor's medical skill and expertise. This class is great for all students, regardless of whether they are pre-med or not. By looking at medicine and human accounts of medicine, I was was able really look back on my life and lifestyle and be feel a sense of thankfulness. Dr G is so knowledgeable in so many different fields apart from medicine. He is also incredibly caring and one of the most humane people I've ever met. Harvard didn't strike me as a place where you become very close to professors, especially as a Freshmen, but Dr. G is the exception. He really cares about his students beyond the academic level into the personal, making sure that we are getting along as individuals and human beings as well. I would take this seminar no matter what--you will not regret it.","This isn't a seminar light on work. It requires effort and time, but it is effort and time you will enjoy. You will find yourself wanting to work and make the effort. Nearly all of the readings are enjoyable and conversation and discussion with your classmates is excellent. Dr. G is amazing, point, blank, period. You will learn so much not only in academics, but in life. Take this course! It was one of the highlights of my freshman year!!!","It's the best class I've taken so far, and it'll probably stay that way for much of my Harvard career. Dr. Groopman is wonderful; from the beginning he takes special care to show an interest in every individual in the class. He's also kind of a big deal. He line-edits every one of your writing pieces (which can get a little arduous since they're assigned every week), but you'll come out of the class feeling proud of the work you've done. My friends had to constantly remind me that it was sat\/unsat since I didn't want to disappoint him with any less-than-great writing pieces. I'm so happy I had the opportunity to take this class.","This seminar is the best class I have taken at Harvard. Dr. Groopman is not only a brilliant person; he is also one of the most genuinely kind and caring people I've met. It's clear that he cares deeply about everything he does, from treating patients to teaching this seminar. While the weekly essays are more work than a normal seminar, the feedback you receive is well worth the time, and the writing prompts are interesting. If you get into this seminar, you should definitely take it.","Take this seminar! It is extremely interesting, especially if you're interested in medicine. Dr. G assigns very interesting readings, you won't ever mind actually reading them. He gives great insight to the books and is extremely knowledgeable about everything that comes up in class. He also brings cookies every class. It is such a friendly atmosphere, and the discussions are great. This is by far one of the best classes I've taken, and I'm so glad that I did!","This class offers an incredible window to learn, understand, and truly grasp what medicine is like from a humanistic perspective. The class does not glorify the practice of medicine. It reveals the truth.","Dr. G is an absolute wonder to learn from and to just be around. He is stunningly knowledgeable about every subject under the sun and is always challenging his students to generate their own thoughts and opinions. This seminar has taught me a great deal not only about illness and medicine, but also about how to write creatively and expressively. And of course, the cookies Dr. G brought to every session made the class all the more amazing!","I would highly recommend this class to any freshman looking to read some fantastic novels, improve your writing, and get some incredible one on one time with an amazing professor. Dr. Groopman is an inspiring doctor and a wonderful person. He may seem intimidating at first, but his playful joking and warm personality soon let you feel relaxed in the classroom. There is a lot of reading and writing assigned, and this class is by no means \"an easy seminar,\" but I loved each and every piece of literature we read throughout the semester and felt that I learned a lot from the writing assignments. This class is just an amazing opportunity! If you have the chance to take it, don't give it up!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 23k","course_id":"1781","cat_num":"1904","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 23k","course_id":"1781","cat_num":"1904","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 23k","course_id":"1781","cat_num":"1904","1s":"2","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
