The workload was very manageable, and the class discussions were always engaging.","This course tackles a wide array of topics and themes, yet definitely feels unified. The workload is certainly manageable, but you do need to keep up with the readings if you want to make valuable contributions to the discussion. This course is formatted as a seminar, so you need to realize early on that much of the learning you will do will come organically from discussions rather than just a strict \"reading and lecture\" format.","This course was great and Professor Lunbeck is AMAZING! I would definitely take it!","Everything you want to know about Freud, Psychoanalysis and, believe it or not, how it all (often) relates to pop-culture is in this course. Very interesting and engaging.","Pretty good class. It's psychoanalysis with a grain of salt: you get to read and seriously engage with freudian concepts while always keeping a critical\/historical distance. Lunbeck is nice and smart, in touch with college life, clearly interested in teaching, and has a great context-appropriate sense of humor. Would strongly recommend to anyone interested in psychoanalysis.","This was a fun and easy course with a good reading list. I liked Prof. Lunbeck as well."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"21","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 179v","course_id":"10999","cat_num":"84218","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 179v","course_id":"10999","cat_num":"84218","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 179v","course_id":"10999","cat_num":"84218","1s":"5","2s":"8","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
