You won't find a professor more engaged than Professor Smail. He and the TF Carla are so committed to helping you improve your writing.","Professor Smail is an excellent professor: he is helpful, accessible, incredibly knowledgable about the topic, and is enthusiastic about the course material. You will learn to look at history from various angles and be a better writer as a result from the class.","I would recommend this class for people who already have some idea of what they would like to write about. Dan is almost frighteningly enthusiastic, and Carla was a great TF (effective writing\/revision help) even though she did not have extensive background in material history. This course was very discussion based and somewhat open ended. The title \"WHAT IS material history\" should have tipped me off about the likelihood of broad sweeping theoretical discussions. Broad, sweeping, and theoretical are not usually words that I find encouraging. However, I still really enjoyed the enthusiasm and constructive-ness (in terms of writing skills) of this class, and managed the semester without engaging too much with texts that I did not understand.","This was a good class!  I learned a lot about how to do history and how to write history papers. It was also interesting and I though the material history aspect was really interesting and great.  Prof. Smail is also great!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"13","response rate":"61.54","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 97f","course_id":"10922","cat_num":"15967","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 97f","course_id":"10922","cat_num":"15967","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 97f","course_id":"10922","cat_num":"15967","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
