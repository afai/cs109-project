But if you take anything higher than Ec 10, this course seems really easy and pointless.","Only take if ec.","Only take this course if you are required to take it (if you're an econ concentrator). If you had an economics background in high school, and want to experience college-level economics, ec 10 is certainly more enjoyable. Ec 1010a1 was not stimulating. Also, I would recommend Miron's section over the other professor (I believe it's Melitz).","I took this class as an elective hoping to learn more about economics. I learned so little, and will probably get a mediocre grade, that I don't think it was worth it. Don't buy the textbook. I found the textbook and workbook online for free.","Do the work and it's easy","This class is light years better than EC10. Better taught and organized. If you put in the effort, then this class would not be too difficult. Just make sure to be prepared for the quizzes and attend section, and you'll be fine. Wouldn't take it for an elective... but it is required for major\/minor","Take this class only if you have to, and if you have the option, take 1011a instead. Although more work and more technical, 1011a will make you feel like you actually learned something and did not waste your semester taking a worse version of Ec10.","This class covered almost exactly the same material as Ec10, just adding calculus.  I felt that I would have been able to learn all of the material without attending lectures and sections, which was unfortunate.  Not a heavy workload, though.","Good micro class, sometimes confusing","Most of the material in Ec1010a is the same as that in Ec10, but with more math. If you enjoyed Ec10, you will most likely enjoy Ec1010a. Be sure to take advantage of the lecture notes posted on the course website - they are clear and cover pretty much everything you need to know.","A decent economics course. It helps with understanding. It is not a class I would take if you were just taking for interest.","Make sure you keep up with speed of course.  Very math-heavy.","The class was very easy to understand after having taken Econ 1010b the previous semester. However, 1010b would have been much easier had I taken 1010a before that, so regardless of which one you take first, the second one is a lot easier.","Don't expect anything revolutionary - unless you are an ec major, I would not recommend.","The material is dry, Miron's lecturing is as well, but that might also be because of the material. I don't know what people thought of 1010a2, but I'd look into it at least.","Ec 1010a is a decent course. Professor Miron is not an exciting or passionate lecturer, but he does get the material across. If you're into economics, you'll probably be reasonably content with this course. If you're looking for an interesting elective, look elsewhere.","This class is interesting if you like sitting in BORING lectures that teach you nothing about the course. Everything you need to know is taught in section.","This was my most frustrating course experience at Harvard thus far. If you already know calculus and you've taken ec 10, this course teaches you almost nothing, but you still have to take the exams and do the homework. Take ec 1011 if you can, that should be a whole lot more rewarding.","much more straightforward that ec10","work hard and actually do follow throughout the semester.","You'll get the most out of this class if you complete all of the problem sets, even if they're optional.","This is a really important course, and you will successfully understand microeconomics from it. Make sure you do the problem sets, discussion questions, and previous exams. Those will help you succeed.","Good class, I liked it much better to EC 10.","Go to section -- it is the best way to prepare for exams. The problems sets are good if you have the time, but you will find yourself doing less and less as you realize that they are barely helpful. Read the lecture notes Miron posts; they are great in explaining how to go through a problem.","Its a concentration requirement, so don't expect too much. Lots of grinding through p-sets and a really difficult final.","Ec 1010 is very dry and boring. It's essentially Ec 10 with only slightly more math. That being said it's a prerequisite for all higher level Econ courses, so you're just going have to slog through it.","Fairly difficult class that you need to study a lot for in order to succeed in.","It's an important class for laying the groundwork for other economics courses, but it is also sort of dull for those who are not super excited about solving equations.","The lectures are not engaging, the quizzes are just the questions you go over in section. I honestly didn't learn anything in this course","You will learn a lot but you should bring analytical skills","The class is very straightforward\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery logical lectures with quizzes each week. Section is as helpful as you make it, so try and actively engage the section leader. For midterms, re-do quizzes and problem sets and old exams; don't spend too much time reading theory\/lecture notes, especially not the textbook. Miron is great and I'd recommend inviting him to a faculty dinner to get to know him!","Do the optional problem sets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey make the class much easier.","Only take it if you have to. It's Ec 10 minus the fun relevant case studies. I didn't feel like I learned anything new. I gave lecture a shot for awhile but stopped going like most everyone else halfway through the semester and found that I wasn't disadvantaged at all. There are quizzes every week based off 2-3 questions given out beforehand with answers, so everyone basically just memorized how to do those problems. I didn't feel like we were prepared for the midterms or final, since these required utilization of skills from all of these quizzes, which individually weren't terrible but only because we had the steps to a solution memorized. It's much tougher to memorize everything at once. This is a class about memorization, not learning. It sucks, but you have to take it.","You may find you like mathematics more than economics, in that case perhaps consider econ 1011. 1010 provides you a basic mathematical and theoretical framework, but doesn't provide a holistic view of the subject matter or modeling experience.","Do the psets beause they help to learn the concepts and to do well on quizzes","This course may not be your most exciting course in economics, but it does lay the appropriate groundwork for thinking like an economist.","read Miron's notes before class and follow along with his lecture. It's much easier to understand and absorb the material this way.","The class covers a lot of important materials and you should definitely take it if you are interested in pursuing Economics as a concentration. The lectures are not that good but the lecture notes are pretty self-explanatory and you can learn a lot of the materials on your own. Sections are useful though.","Work harder early","It allows students to easily access concepts of microeconomics without getting burdened with too much math.","Take it only if you have to.","This was not my favorite class but did provide a solid grounding in microeconomic theory.","This class is great if you put in the time to learn the material.  I love microeconomics and I think this class helped give me a deeper understanding of the subject.","Don't fool yourself\u00e2\u20ac\u201c just because you did well on the weekly quizzes doesn't mean you won't flunk the final.","The problem sets are long and tedious and you rarely see how what you are learning can be applied. Go to lectures and do all the practice exams and the exams should go ok, but you probably won't be very inspired by this course. I think the material is pretty useful, though.","Don't take it, unless you're interested in economics. Even if you are interested in economics, most of the material taught in this class is foundational. Foundational is a synonym for boring.","Lecture notes are the most helpful component of this course.","Definitely pay attention to pset questions as well as discussion questions.","This course can be dull at times, and while deceptively easy throughout the semester, the exams can be hard, particularly the final exam.","This is going to be one of your worst Harvard classes. While the course materials are fairly OK if not decent, the teaching is going to be extremely horrible. I have never had any drier lecture before in my three years at Harvard. It wasn't really because Miron was a bad lecturer, but because the course itself is very difficult to teach well. Luckily the lecture notes are going to cover everything in class, so don't even bother to go to lectures except for the last 15 mins of Friday for the quiz.\r\n\r\nMy experience with section was horrible. My TF was extremely incompetent and awkward, and could not answer any question other than those they have already been prepared for.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is not going to be a rewarding experience at all. My suggestion is to avoid it if you don't have to, or to take Ec1011 if you are able to.","Only take it if you're interested in ec, if not take some other course. Don't take it as a gen ed","If you want a solid course that builds on Ec10, 1010a will be do just that. The math level is rigorous enough to teach you how to model economic scenarios, but not too difficult either.","Course is really not well structured, so if you take it you would really need to push yourself to do the work in order to be prepared for exams, as no one else will make sure you're on top of things","I took this class as an elective to learn some ec. I guess I learned something, but the examples and questions seemed very artificial and probably do not relate to real life at all.","This is a concentration requirement. I would not have taken it otherwise. Just have to get through it.","Go to class, do the readings\/work","Read the lecture notes, do the problem sets, and do the discussion questions and practice exams and the class will end up being one of the easiest courses you can take.","Economics 1010a is a repeat of the concepts from Economics 10, with math. I thought it was interesting applying math to the concepts, but sometimes I felt like I wasn't getting that much from it. Overall, the course wasn't that difficult and didn't take as much time as Ec-10, but still don't think you can slack off.","Only take this class if you must in order to fulfill some sort of requirement.","This class is definitely excellent in giving foundation to the field of economics. While the p-sets can be a pain to do they are essential to understanding the material the best!","Do lots of practice problems (from the workbook) and all of the previous midterms\/finals when studying for exams! Material can be a little dry and confusing. You derive a lot of equations in class and the derivations are confusing but you do not need to know them, so sometimes class can seem irrelevant compared to what you will actually be tested on.","I had heard bad reviews about prior iterations of this class, but I thought it was excellent!  The lectures were engaging and to-the-point.  The textbook was easy to read and relevant to class material.  It's structure was perfect for learning -- you completed optional, ungraded problem sets, the answers to which were always available online, and then completed a weekly quiz based on that week's problem set.  The tests were fair.  All in all an excellent, straightforward class.","If you put in the required efforts, which is not as much as you might think, this class can be easy and rewarding.","Don't become bogged down in unnecessary reading and focus on practicing the problem sets.","This class was immensely disorganized. It was really frustrating because you never knew who to contact for issues. Lectures were disjoint from the quizzes and exams, and exam questions were either extremely easy or nothing but tricks.","It's a good course!","Very basic micro class with a fair workload.","The class taught me a lot. Was kinda hard, but MAKE SURE YOU GET MARIKA AS TF, she's Awesome and really cares about her students and her explanations\/Office Hours are very helpful in understanding the course content!","It's thorough, it's not fun.","just like ec10 micro, just a bit more in-depth.","This course is solid. Professor Miron is an excellent lecturer, much better than Melitz, as he has taught the course for many years. Attending lecture and section is a must if you want to succeed, and you should complete the problem sets (even though they aren't collected) to ensure you understand the concepts and do well on the quizzes. Exams are fairly difficult but fair, and quizzes (which comprise 20% of the grade) are straightforward - you should have a 100 percent average for your quizzes if you attend section and lectures and complete the problem sets. Help can be difficult to find, but again, completing the problem sets and reading Miron's notes are extremely helpful. Note that while multivariable calculus isn't required, you need a solid foundation in calculus, and will be taught some calculus from 21a.","Lectures are near-exact replicas of lecture notes. On one hand, it means you could refer to lecture notes if you don't understand something from lecture, but on the other, lectures are dry and Professor Myron also speeds through things. Exams are fairly challenging.","Beware the final exam, and be sure to go to class on days that aren't Friday (quiz day)."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Be prepared for rough midterms and to be lost in lecture at times. Do the readings before class as Professor Miron moves pretty quickly. Take at least a week to prepare for exams.","Don't take this class unless you need to. It is not taught very well and can be quite frustrating when you have to take weekly quizzes on information that isn't necessarily explained very well.","A difficult but very necessary class in developing a fundamental understanding of economics.","This is a great course if you want to obtain more mastery over introductory microeconomic topics. This course delves further into the topics covered in economics 10 and I would recommend it to anyone interested in gaining economic knowledge. The court will require a bit amount of work, with problem sets, weekly quizzes, two midterms and a final. However, I think it is a course that is very applicable to every day life and covers topics that will make you a more informed voter and inhabitant of an increasingly interdependent economic world.","The worst class at Harvard, hands down. From day one, the professor knew that we were over 100 kids over capacity in our original classroom, and yet he waited two entire weeks to shift us into a larger room. This made learning impossible because nobody could see the board or hear, and it blatantly violated the fire code. \r\n\r\nLectures were a merely a verbatim recitation of the professor's online lecture notes, and the only reason people attended lecture was to turn in problem sets on Tuesdays and take the mandatory quizzes on Thursdays. Hundreds of kids would wait until 15 minutes before class to show up, and take care of any mandatory work for that day's lecture. \r\n\r\nThe textbook was useless and nobody ever read it. Section was only useful because they'd give out the answers to 3 problems from the problem sets, which were graded very arbitrarily - one problem would be selected at random to be graded for accuracy. Exams were also very poorly designed - they did not at all reflect the quality and difficulty of problems done on problem sets and practice exams and were solely designed to be difficult so as to generate a bell curve for the class (told to me directly by the TF who wrote them). \r\n\r\nYou are better off taking Ec 10 again. Honestly, just memorize everything David Johnson taught you in Ec 10 and apply basic calculus where it seems intuitive. That's this class, but better taught.","lectures are dry but the material is great","If you actually enjoy Economics, you will do fine in this class.","If you can not take this class, don't take it.","Problem sets and exams are difficult but there is plenty of help.","Professor Miron is very down to earth and likes to connect what we learn in class to life issues or issues in the economy and government. The midterms are wicked hard and does not represent what you have done in the course very well. Be sure to read all the lecture notes and to know how to do all the problems in them as they can be asked despite not being in the problem sets.","This course is tough and will challenge you, but if you enjoy microeconomics you will not be disappointed. The lectures are very dry, so bring the lecture notes with you to help you follow along.","Only for ec concentrators.","This class is good, but it was challenging. Know your math, keep up, and start strong and stay strong. Do the PSets before section.","Miron, the TFs, and many of the students go through the motions of this class.","Make sure you are very comfortable with AB Calc! Having a basic understanding of Statistics (Stat 104, AP Stat, etc.) may also help.","Definitely a manageable class. Read the lecture notes before going to lecture to get the most of it (though most of you probably will end up skipping lecture entirely.) The mid-terms this year were much harder than in years past so make sure you actually know the material going into the exams. Go to section, it helps a lot with the Psets.","Only take this course if you are required to.","The lectures were often dry, but only because the material itself was often dry. The midterms were very difficult- do a ton of practice problems to prepare! Professor Miron was a solid lecturer, and tried his best to be engaging.","If you haven't taken an economics class at Harvard, you should probably take Ec10 first. Don't jump into this class unless you have a strong economics background\/interest already. If you're taking this as an elective - don't. Take Ec10.","Take multivariable calculus concurrently","Concentration requirement. Material is extremely important and mostly enjoyable if you are actually interested in economics. Very visible lack of caring and effort by the teaching staff.","Its sometimes challenging to get through, and a 1.5 hour lecture is difficult. That being said, I did feel like i learned something.","Not exactly the most riveting subject; it provides the basics and is a requirement for the degree. Sections and problem sets are the things that will help you learn the most.","Take it because it's necessary for economics majors and you just have to get through it. It won't be the best Econ class you ever take at harvard, and that's okay.","You must take this class even if you have slight interest in economics. The class will help you understand the important concepts in microeconomics really well and it gives you the scope to analyze business and policy decisions. This class is also an alternative to Econ 1011a for those students who are not too comfortable with math, but that also meant it would help you focus on the concepts better rather than getting drowned in math.","Very boring material for the most part.","Its not that bad.","Only take this class if you absolutely have to. Lecture is a waste of time-just read Professor Miron's lecute notes online. Attend section so you can finish your problem sets, but don't hope to learn anything. Section is not a review of lecture material. Your TF will just show you how to tackle 50-100% of your problem set for the week. Exams rarely look like review materials, so be sure to prepare well beyond the extent to which you are told to prepare.","If you don't have to take this course and can just take 1010b, i might opt for that. the hour and a half lectures are brutal and not necessarily helpful for the specific problems on the psets and midterms.  that said, there are definitely times when this understanding of microeconomics is valuable and interesting. The midterms were kind of tough because it was really short on time and the test surprised me with many of its parts","It's kind of boring but its necessary so take it","It's really not that bad of a micro class, and I'm assuming that most of you who are reading this are either concentrators or getting a secondary so you kind of have to take the course. The weekly psets aren't too bad, and you do some of the questions in your section so with a good study group they aren't that painful. If you do the pset, the quiz will be painless, so not something to stress about. I normally would just study during the Thursday lecture, since they are at the end of class, and normally did just fine. Overall I actually really enjoyed the course, and as long as you are kind of on top of your stuff, it isn't that bad at all.","If you're not concentrating in econ, probably not worth it...but definitely a good option for freshman who are pretty adept in microecon","Practice midterms are not reflective of actual midterms. Study more than you think you need to, so you won't get the shock of a lifetime when you actually see the test.  Make sure you get 100% on the quizzes and homework to balance out the difficulty of the exams.","Do not take this course if you do not have to! The material, exams, section, and lecture are simply terrible.","Pretty relaxed class with fair tests and relaxed sections.","We have to do it.","Only take if you have to for your concentration. All you need to do is get through it.","I would like to tell future students to most definitely consider this class. The course provides a unique and effective mixture of mathematical modeling and calculation with fundamental micro-economic reasoning and concepts. In other words, deifnitely enhances and builds upon previous economic understanding by introducing more powerful porblems and applications.","The introduction to each section in the Workbook is a pretty good review.","Take it if you need to so you can move up in the department. But if you're already questioning Ec as a concentration, then maybe no... Don't expect to really LEARN anything. It's about the psets and exams. Churning out problems rather than reaching a new intellectual level.","This course is difficult but it is beneficial in the end.","The class was really easy on a weekly basis, but the problem sets were overly simple and formulaic and didn't really prepare us for midterms that went more in depth. Rather than teaching us concepts, they trained us to solve specific forms of problems.","If you are set on economics then get through this, but if you are unsure it is not a course to take.","It is a decent class, with a much bigger mathematical foundation than I expected. It is poorly taught in lecture, but the materials and assessment are quite good.","More productive to read lecture notes than to go to lecture. The class is not particularly enjoyable, but you need it for Econ. That said, you will learn basic micro theory, and the workload is very reasonable.","Sections optional, but worth your time.","It is a requirement for Econ concentrations and secondaries but it is not terribly exciting.","Take if you have to","If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to.  It's boring, stupid, poorly run, and not very educational.  I once went to Miron's office hours and complained that there weren't enough seats in the lecture hall for students in the class.  He told me I was better off not going to lecture, and instead just reading the lecture notes.  I felt pretty embarrassed that Harvard would offer such a large class the professor which recommended I not attend it.","Lectures are not fun at all, but the lecture notes are better","This class was a bit annoying. It was essentially a repeat of Ec 10, but with a little bit of single-variable calculus. For Ec majors, it is just one of those courses you have to trudge through. The midterms were ridiculously hard this year, but he made the final a bit easier luckily. Good luck to those that have to take this!","This class sucks but you have to take it. If you paid attention in ec 10a, you won't learn anything new. It's basically the same exact curriculum with a little more math. The quizzes are really annoying, and it's hard to know what to expect on exams. It's not hard, but you're still gonna hate this class.","First and foremost it is not as bad as people pretend. I have done IB EC got a 6\/7, skipped EC10 and managed with an average of 3 hours a week for this class. BUT get Ryan as a TF. He is by far the best TF in this class, it is thanks to him that I survived. The lecture is literally 100% based on the lecture note! Go to lecture though and have the lecture notes with you to follow and you will get it! Do the pset seriously, don't copy them as midterms and quizzes are based on them. Prepare for the quizzes by looking at the psets and thinking how they might change them ( it also helps for the midterms). You will be just fine, the curve is amazing!!! And get to know Miron in a personal level he is really cool!","If you have to take it you have to take.","Don't be discouraged if you walk into a lecture hall on the first day with no room to stand at the back (or even enter the class); the crowd thins out after the first week. (Annoying that most of the students seem to not care about going to lecture since they think Prof. Miron's a bad lecturer or don't want to put in the work or think it's a 'joke', but that's a different matter. I think Prof. Miron doesn't give himself enough credit; the lectures are pretty good and he incorporates interesting stuff that's relevant to everyday life.) If you took Ec 10, you'll have the solid background you need to do well -- this class covers essentially the same topics, but goes more in-depth and involves more math (only to basic single-var calc level, although it's helpful if you know partial derivation as well). A lot of people may say the class is easy but I don't think that's necessarily the case -- while the amount of work you put in might not be that high (just weekly p-sets\/quizzes, plus two midterms), it can still be challenging. If you're considering Ec1011 (as I was), I think it's worth shopping both and seeing for yourself what 'feels' better to you; I felt this was the right course for me. Ec1011 incorporates more math (even though they say Math 21a is a prereq I think both 21a and 21b should be), and that math can get extremely tedious on p-sets.","Tough. Take it if you have to.","Expect to need to know basic statistics and multivariable calculus and be able to use it on a detailed basis. Very good intermediate class though.","This class is very interesting and not too hard! If you took Ec10 you won't learn anything new, but you will still enjoy your time in the class.","only take if you have to...if you suck at math like me, get a tutor right away it's the only way to survive","The lectures arent great","The class is, overall, very boring. That being said, it really isnt that bad. There are a ton of assignments, but that means you don't have to do so well on all of them and are actually kept up on the material. Also, the lectures were really boring but all of the lecture notes were online so you really didn't have to go that often. Also, the two midterms were kinda unfair, but that was made up by a super easy final. Overall, the class is kinda painful but chances are you probably need to take it anyway so just go for it.","It is a very difficult course and the lecture is not very interesting.","This is a difficult course with lots of information to learn.","Do not take this class unless you have to. If you're debating between this and 1010b, take 1010b and run away from this class. This has been my least favorite class at Harvard, they make it clear in this class that it's not about learning, so if you're taking this class suck it up cause it's going to suck.","its just something u gotta do","If you're an Ec concentrator, you will be forced to take this course. I din't personally like Professor Mirion, because I didn't think he taught very well, but the course is not bad. Its concepts are very applicable and interesting to a wide variety of things around the world.","midterms were rough, but final was a breeze if you studied for it. if you're an ec concentrator or secondary, just put your head down and get through it. otherwise, there are easier and more interesting classes out there","Miron is extremely boring and doesn't want to be there.","Be prepared to struggle and do a lot of work.","It is hard so know you want to go Economics at the time.","Stay on top of your stuff and take advantage of office hours","It is unfortunate that this is a required class for economics concentrators. The material is actually very interesting, but is presented in a way that makes it unnecessarily complicated. Simple concepts were buried amongst an obscene amount of greek letters in what was a sad excuse for lecture notes.","This class is enjoyable, and you can get a lot out of the class if you stay on top of notes and really put work into the pests and quizzes.","It's like the orgo of economics concentration...suck it up and do it so you can enjoy the rest.","It is an incredibly boring class (according to Miron himself), but everyone must take it.","This class was fairly difficult. Lecture was not very helpful for actually learning what you needed to know for problem sets and exams, whereas section was great for helping with pset questions. The two midterms were hard- they were very loosely connected to previous years' exams, even after the teaching staff said they were basically identical. The final was very fair, though.","It is not the most exciting class, but you ill learn a lot and be able to understand material in other classes and in the newspaper better.","The class is very difficult. You should come to class having read the lecture notes or the chapters in the book so lecture is easier to follow.","It's a requirement for concentrators. Hate it or love it, you have to take it. Understanding that, it'll be a lot more tolerable if you accept it and understand that it'll do you well in the end.","The beginning is challenging, and his lectures can be hard to understand, but when it comes to the test you'll find an easier job than you'd think.","Do the psets diligently because they test exactly what is needed on quizzes and exams.","This course is a very straightforward followup to EC10, and presents a decent application of easy 1-variable calculus concepts to solve basic maximization\/minimization problems.  Lectures are a little dry, but make sure you show up to section and do the review material - those will help you immensely on problem sets and final exams.","This class is very challenging. The material is not difficult in theory because it's similar to Ec10 but the applications are difficult. However, if you put time into understanding the concepts, I think that the work is manageable.","Easy course. The grading is straight-forward, which you will thank when finals and midterms come around. Studying is also straight-forward, you basically just study the stuff they give you and you'll do well. Pretty decent fourth class to round off a difficult semester.","This class is Ec10 on steroids, and that's a good thing. For the more mathematically inclined, you'll find that the derivations of concepts in this course (using calculus) actually make sense! In Ec10 it always felt like equations and ideas were being pulled out of thin air. The lecture notes are extremely useful and correlate strongly to the lectures themselves. Miron's a nice guy; don't hesitate to ask questions even in a class this size. Do the review problems and this class should come very naturally to you. One of my favorite classes this semester.","you have to take it. just do it.","Be sure to keep track and study the lesson each week.","Go to office hours, read the lecture slides, and do the psets and you will be fine","Depending on who the professor is, this may be an easy course or an extremely difficult course.","Take ec10a or ec1011a, not sure there was a need for an intermediate class","This is an amazing class if you put in the required work. The TF's are amazing and readily available to help and in general the material is well explained in class so you are good either way!","It's sooooooo boring.  Just work to get through it.","Would recommend only as a concentration requirement. Other than that it is dry and boring and poorly taught. If you don't do the problem sets you are in big trouble on the exams, but if you do problem sets and attend section you will be fine. Lecture is basically optional.","If you have the math for it, take ec1011.  Or just try to get out of taking this class somehow.","This class is hard. Exams were way of proposition in terms of difficulty compared to problem sets and previous\/practice exams. You don't learn anything in lecture, so it becomes a hour long cram session with your tf right before you turn you pset in.","Kind of boring","Lecture: long, interesting at times, fully covered in lecture notes\r\nSection: super helpful for the problem sets\r\nHomework: very manageable, especially if you go to section and lecture\r\nQuizzes: very easy to do well if you can do the homework problems\r\nExams: unpredictable, some are incredibly easy and others are unexpectedly hard\r\n\r\nOverall: the class does have a good structure and foundation, but they need to be much more organized to make it a great class","Don't expect to enjoy this class.  Compared to Ec10, it's much less personal, and you basically learn the same exact material except with calculus.  Professor Miron is a nice guy, but his lectures really aren't up to snuff, and considering you can learn just as much by looking at the lecture notes online, attending lecture becomes less and less of a concern as the semester goes on.  It's something you have to take for Econ, and it's pretty east, but don't expect it to be fun","venting time. i thought this course was poorly taught, the material is boring and doesn't feel applicable to the real world, the midterm exams (especially the first one) were unfair. you could tell multiple people thought this way seeing as by week 5 the lecture hall was at least half empty every class. only take this class if you need to","It's not as bad as some people say. Definitely gave me stronger models for dealing with real problems than intro did. Go to section, they do problems right off the pset. After section, the pset should be quick and painless.","Good intermediate class with good lecture notes to help guide you along. The midterms seemed slightly tougher than the years before which caught many people by surprise.","If you have to take this course do it, but it isn't that interesting. The subject material is largely the same as Ec10, it just has a lot more math (not that hard of math though). The class is not actually that hard, but it is hard to stay motivated in it and attend all lectures. I think many students, including myself, wish they had put in more effort because I think grades could have been much higher. It does strengthen your economic abilities, and makes you more confident as a thinker.","Lot of math and pretty hard.","This class is a breeze if you've taken single variable calculus and Ec10. The lectures are incredibly boring, though, and you don't really even need to go.","The exams are pretty difficult, but have faith in the curve.","Only take if you have to. Not sure how much better Ec 1010b.","If you are taking the class in the same conditions I did this semester, only take it if needed for your concentration requirement.","The lectures are incredibly dry and tough to get through. Having said that, the problem sets are not too hard and section is really helpful. While it's not as fun as ec 10 in my opinion, it's not too bad overall as the workload isn't too bad and you do learn valuable economic analytic skills.","As a non-concentrator who was basically taking this course as an elective, my opinion might not be very valuable. I found the course material interesting, and I didn't think that the problem sets or the preparation for exams required an unreasonable amount of time. So I recommend it, I guess, acknowledging that most people considering Ec 1010 don't want to take it for the same reasons I did.","Keep up with the material.","Only take this class if need be for concentration requirement.","Miron hates teaching this class, he basically says so on the first day, so don't expect too much. It's ridiculous that they do not let you use calculators because you basically waste all your time on exams doing annoying arithmetic. Also, DON'T buy the workbook. You can get a pdf online just by googling it. I would not buy the textbook either. It's 150 bucks and I probably opened it once. \r\n\r\nDon't take this unless you're doing ec.","I have very mixed feelings about this course. I feel that I did learn a lot, but I also feel that I learned so much because of the extra efforts I put into this class. Lectures are absolutely useless, so don't go at all. Spend that time on reading and understanding the lecture slides, which are way more useful. DO GO TO SECTION. In section your TF will solve some of the problems of the weekly set. Also - the workbook is necessary, but the textbook is not. The lecture slides are way better.","This whole class is just one big joke. From the fact that they don't grade your entire PSET (instead they grade 1 of 11 questions, and base your entire PSET grade on that), to the awful lectures, to the really rude and disinterested TF's (most of whom barely spoke English anyway), this is by far the worst organized course I have ever taken at Harvard. You'll probably end up taking it to fulfill your concentration req's anyway, but don't let that stop you from thinking twice about taking this class. It would be nice if Prof. Miron and his staff actually seriously got their act together and stopped being so lazy with how they deliver their sections (which were terrible) and graded the PSET's fully, and delivered a proper course.","I feel like this class is poorly taught, simply because the lectures are often difficult to follow. Very few times did I leave lecture thinking \"I really understood what we talked about today.\" While that may not happen too often for any particular class, I felt like I was quite lost until section or even sometimes later. However, I do think this class introduces important topics that do really make you think about the ideas of microeconomics in the real world.","Take it if economics is your concentration or secondary field.","This class is a great introductory class for economics students. The material is difficult so definitely put 10-15 hours a week especially in the beginning and be prepared for a steep curve around exams.","I honestly really enjoyed the material and mathematical elements of the course. Unfortunately, it was not taught very well and we were told on the first day that it is a boring class.","Take if required, but avoid if not.","This class is terrible, dont take it unless you have to, it blows.","It's a class you have to take, so take it. Probably won't be the most enjoyable, but hey, you'll learn a lot and it does what you need it to do.","If you're reading this,  you probably have to take this class anyway.\r\nYou're in for a good one, I'll tell you that much.","Only take this class if you have to for concentration\/secondary field requirement.","You learn a lot about applying economics and calculus to solve problems but the course material is not the most exciting.","Class is boring, but make sure you prepare for the problem sets and try to go to office hours.","This is an okay class if you are interested in microeconomic modeling. However, Professor Miron is a very boring lecturer and the class is pretty mundane as well. If you need it for a pre-rec or for your concentration, take it, but definitely be aware that it will be one of the least engaging classes you will probably take at Harvard.","It's a great course and you learn a lot of concepts that can apply to real life situations.","If you're comfortable with math and intend to concentrate in Econ, Applied Math in Econ, or even get a secondary in Econ, I'd consider skipping ec 10 altogether.","This is a very easy A, but it is also somewhat of a waste of a course. You can definitely take any course that lists 1010 as a requirement without taking 1010. But like I said it is an easy A and you do learn some things although not in too much depth.","This class was the worst Ive taken so far at Harvard- but has tremendous upward potential if someone in the department cares enough to change that. Exams were math and time intensive (and difficult). Lectures were useless.","Not many students attend lecture, but if you do, you will find that Prof. Miron can be confusing at times in class, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get lost. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to speak up, ask questions, and ask him to repeat things in class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c chances are that everyone else is just as confused!\r\n\r\nThe quizzes are just like the problem sets which are just like the section discussion questions (side note: that means you should go to section, because it will save you time on the homework!), but the midterms will be harder than you think they will be! Do all the previous years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exams, and develop an INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING of all the formulas, equations, and concepts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and seek help from your TF \/ Prof. Miron if you are confused with anything.\r\n\r\nProfessor Miron may not be extremely helpful, but he is definitely very kind and very accessible. Just send him an email if you are confused on any concepts or want extra help preparing for an exam, and he is likely to be willing to meet with you one-on-one.","Only take it if it is for your concentration. If you are doing a minor in ec, do 1010b. This class defines boring, which Miron admits (he starts many lectures saying it will be a boring hour and a half). You learn nothing (unlike ec10). All you do is take partial derivatives for a semester and learn how to solve a few types of problems, but have no idea how to apply it to the world.\r\nIf David Johnson were teaching this class, it would be SOOOO much better.","Try to appreciate the interesting subjects that the equations relate to.","Curving is tough","gotta go to lecture","I recommend this course because the material is quite useful and interesting, but it's definitely not a simple and easy class (read: maybe don't take it unless you need it for your concentration or secondary unless you're really interested in micro). Although the material is nothing completely new after Ec10, 1010 still goes deeper and clarifies a lot that lacked from Ec10 without belaboring each topic. Overall it's a solid course, but keep in mind that the quizzes and midterms were tricky and difficult and it can be hard to keep track of your grade throughout the course. Miron is pretty cool and incredibly intelligent and, though the lectures can get a little long-winded in the mathematic explanations, his no-BS teaching style is definitely a nice break from some other professors. Don't be worried about the course if you're stressing because you need to take it for your concentration or secondary, it's ultimately pretty painless if you put in work along the way.","Would recommend not taking it unless for the economics concentration","The lectures get boring by the end of the semester, and attendance is not really required. The course material is really cool though, because it helps you to see the stuff you learn in introductory economics in a new light.","I personally do not find the course intriguing, but helpful in understanding micro an personal economics.","If you think you're going to struggle then get a tutor.","The material can be dull at times, but the class overall is worth taking.","You will learn the material well, but you will have difficulty convincing yourself to go to class.","This class could really be improved. An hour-and-a-half lecture is probably too long, and most students I talked to learned more in section than from lecture. That being said, Professor Miron is not out to get you, and the class is manageable-I just wish it were more fun.","Not as bad as people say. It is a very fair course. If you do your work, you will get a good grade.","Takeaways: \r\n1) The course gives you basic quantitative framework of economic thinking. \r\n2) Quantitative explanation of qualitative concepts learned in Ec 10. \r\n\r\nWarning: \r\nClassic econ class problem: too big, no personal attention => easy to fall behind w\/o accountability. \r\n\r\nTips: \r\n1) The book is optional, but for sections that I needed clarification, it was crucial. \r\n2) P-set problems are solved in section. Not going to section, p-set will take 3~5 hrs. Going to section, p-set will take 1~2 hrs. \r\n3) Don't study theory first. Best approach was to start by solving actual problems, then going back to understand the theory, then returning to the problems.","Huge class, but sections are useful if you have a good TF. Go to office hours! It's not enough to just know the problem sets when you do them, make sure to think about the intuition and actually do problems thoroughly. It isn't a walk in the park, but also isn't too difficult.","Probably not one of favorite classes you will take at Harvard. If you did \"Principles of Economics\" as a freshman, this class seems to be teaching you hardly anything except making you a little bit more apt in optimization problems. Also, the course does not have anyone like David Johnson from Ec 10, which makes you miss your previous year's process of learning economics. However, it's a concentration requirement, so you have to take it. But if you're good enough in multivariable calculus, you might shop Ec 1011.","This class is totally doable because of the grade breakdown.  Lectures were not terribly helpful, as Miron can be very confusing in his explanations, but his lecture notes are incredible and much more concise than the textbook chapters.","Be willing to work and use the resources provided to you outside of class. It can be confusing to know from what to study or on what material to focus one's attention, but understanding the psets thoroughly is crucial.","This is a very hands-off course where you will do psets and memorize math, but not use any deduction in finding the underlying implications behind any of the concepts, at least that is not required to do well in the course. Based on a seemingly unrealistic mathematical function that is hard to quantify in everyday life.","This class dealt with economic topics in greater depth and pushed me to think more about the different concepts.","For anyone considering Ec1010 vs Ec10, I would suggest Ec1010.  It will be harder but it is definitely possible with a little more work.  Also gives you more flexibility within the econ department in terms of electives.","Make sure to really work on the pests and study them for the quizzes.","Good class if interested in Economics","Go to lecture. Though what you need to know is in the notes, professor Miron will highlight what is most important for your success on the psets and in tests.","Keep in mind that though economics can be extremely interesting, Ec1010a makes no effort to get you excited about economics as a discipline. It serves its purpose in that it helps you learn the Neoclassical model, but beyond that, it's a total dud.","This class is chill if you put in some time studying for tests","the curve is quite good so do not be discouraged if the material seems hard","This class is not very engaging, though it is foundational at the same time. If you are taking it as a concentration requirement, just get through it, but I would not recommend taking the course as an elective.","hard to get through","Be prepared to learn the material on your own.","Print out the lecture notes before every lecture! Trust me, they are extremely helpful for following along and for the psets.","Although the material is not necessarily hard, the class is extremely unpleasant. The professor and the teaching fellows did not provide enough support. Lectures were often irrelevant to the material that would be tested. Teaching fellows did not provide practice problems beyond the problems on the homeworks. The fact that this class is a requirement should not be an excuse for such a poorly-run and poorly-taught class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.70","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"295","response rate":"92.88","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1010a1","course_id":"953","cat_num":"58552","1s":"31","2s":"74","3s":"117","4s":"40","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1010a1","course_id":"953","cat_num":"58552","1s":"7","2s":"19","3s":"116","4s":"100","5s":"27"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1010a1","course_id":"953","cat_num":"58552","1s":"27","2s":"153","3s":"73","4s":"14","5s":"5"}},"success":true}
