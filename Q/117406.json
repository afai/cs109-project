If you think you're not, however, the main part of this course might be too much technical language change stuff you don't care too much about. Also, if you're looking for classes that will go out of their way to challenge you, this isn't the course for you either.","This is a great low-key introduction for students who think they might be interested in linguistics. You will gain an appreciation for how much can be accomplished with linguistics.","This class was fun and interesting but not stressful at all. The psets were fun because we got to do them in groups.","This class was really fun! Jay is a great teacher, kind, and also very smart. We learned a lot without feeling forced too, and I walk out with a good basic knowledge what linguistics is. The problem sets are short and fun, and the final project is too. The small class allows you to bond with our classmates and Jay. The discussion of prehistory and faulty applications of linguistics to the telling of some historical events was near the end, but I thought it was important and put the field into a broader context.","This class has been one of the highlights of my freshman experience. Prof. Jasanof is very knowledgeable about historical linguistics and gives an excellent introduction to language change and its use and misuse. The class may be less interactive than some seminars due to most of the students not having any background in linguistics, but there was still much participation and discussion within the lectures; Prof. Jasanof used examples from languages we knew to make points about language change, for example. Everyone in the class was passionate about learning the material; we collaborated on problem sets and ended up talking about the material a lot outside of class. If you are interested in this subject matter, take the course; if not, choose another seminar.","Take this class if your really interested in the subject materieal because you will enjoy it a lot. However, if you just want to take a random seminar, it is a bit boring.","If it sounds at all interesting to you, take it! I went into this class with absolutely no background in Linguistics, solely because I thought it sounded fun. Although most of the other students had some background, I still learned a ton and had a blast.","This class was the most interesting I took this semester. Light workload and a very manageable research paper due at the end of the course.","While the topic is very interesting, the actual classes were mainly lectures, which wasn't very engaging. Plus, considering freshman seminars don't actually count for any credit, I think taking a \"real class\" (i.e. actual linguistics course) might be more practical.","This class is a great introduction to linguistics, and Jay is an awesome and approachable professor. The problem sets were fun to work on, and this class can really help you determine whether you want to pursue a secondary or concentration in linguistics.","I think this course will give you a good idea of whether you like historical linguistics. You will spend a lot of time at the beginning doing elementary principles of linguistics (where is this sound made in the mouth? etc.). The extent to which you find this excruciating is probably a good indication of the extent to which you are interested in linguistics as a discipline versus simply the idea of studying languages. This is just a guess, however, since I haven't taken any further linguistics courses.  My interest is more in philosophy of language, and the overlap between that and the linguistics in this class is fairly minimal. I left fairly sure that I won't be taking many more linguistics courses. However, as you do learn a fair bit about the principles historical linguistics operates by as a discipline (i.e. methodology and fundamental assumptions), the material of the class raises a lot of very interesting questions about epistemology and the nature of evidence, so it *might* be worth it if you're into that kind of thing. I'm very into that kind of thing, but I still found myself unhappy at times - the problem sets, for example, are both very intricate and fussy without requiring much deep thought. I don't know that many of us became very close to Jay, but through no fault of his own - he made himself very accessible. At the end of the day, even though it felt like a bit of a slog, I realize that I now know many very interesting things about the history of language that I didn't before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.30","difficulty":"2.10","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 34x","course_id":"10812","cat_num":"9905","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 34x","course_id":"10812","cat_num":"9905","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 34x","course_id":"10812","cat_num":"9905","1s":"8","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
