Dr. Noll is awesome. If you're really into rigid course structures and discussion, this may not be the class for you. But if you want real discussions about real topics, you should take this class.","Definitely take this course if you have any interest in finding out more about feminist ideas. I never had taken any class dealing with feminism and this truly was a great introduction to the field and in a psychology context. Dr. Noll is extremely helpful in always providing new resources you can look into to know more about any topic discussed in class and is always open to talking with you. She also is great at directing discussion so everyone can feel included but not pressured to participate. Therefore, I would definitely recommend this class.","Dr. Noll is so wonderful! Just being taught by her is a reason to take this class!","best class ever - feminism is a dirty word in our generation, but this class will really push you to consider gender and our ideas about what it means to be a \"woman\" in this world. the class is less structured than SLS20, but the discussions were very interesting and the materials had a lot of relevance to my daily life. definitely take this course!!! the assignments are very manageable (but so interesting), and i know i'm going to reference this course in the years to come","This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard by far.  Dr. Noll is incredible and the material is not only fascinating but also extremely important.  It's a fantastic course for people of any gender interested in gender relations, psychology, and health.","This was an absolutely incredible class. Dr. Noll is such a great professor, so easy to talk to, and so good at pushing us to think in new ways. The material in the class was so interesting, and I could definitely say it has changed the way I see the world and the way I interact with others. I reallllyyyy reallllyyyy hope Dr. Noll gets to stay at Harvard, because if this class is offered again next year, I am forcing my friends to take it.","Take this course! Dr. Noll is extremely knowledgable. I learned so much from Dr. Noll and my classmates. The readings, assignments, and other materials are all relevant. This course has impacted how I interact with people and made me a better person. The topic could not be more applicable to the real world. It's an important topic and an excellent class.","Take this class!!! This class encourages such important discussion about gender dynamics that are still extremely relevant to daily life in all walks of life. Also, Professor Noll is an amazing person who is very capable of staying unbiased and listening to all opinions. I really enjoyed this class and it has made me much more acutely aware of gender disparities that operate in our culture today."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"18","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1009","course_id":"11379","cat_num":"57367","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1009","course_id":"11379","cat_num":"57367","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1009","course_id":"11379","cat_num":"57367","1s":"2","2s":"9","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
