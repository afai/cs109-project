You will learn a lot of useful Fourier analysis, signal processing, and statistical methods.  With Professor Moran, it runs a lot like a college-level applied math class, which I thought was extremely refreshing. However, if you are looking for a very advanced course on Bayesian analysis in Astrophysics, you might decide to pass on this and look elsewhere (summer schools, reading Numerical Recipes, etc).  Overall, a highly recommended elective."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class will help you understand what observers do.  Nice overview for observers, and good for theorists since it demystifies a lot of observer jargon (e.g. bootstrapping, MCMC analysis, etc.)","You will learn all you need about the subject."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The course is work-intensive but the effort is worth it. You will come out of this class armed with many tools.","great class but be prepared to work more than you might expect!","It is a good course where you will learn a lot about analyzing data, but the lectures can leave something to be desired, and the homework assignments are challenging.","The material you will learn will be very useful. But the lecturing format and assignment style are not always the most exciting, so you will need a good dose of coffee.","You will learn a lots, but the homework volume can be overwhelming sometimes.","Extremely useful subject material, explained well.  Workload is reasonable, similar to other courses.","I found the course fantastic and enjoyable.  I felt I learned a lot of useful material, and the problem sets were insightful while (usually) manageable.  Moran is a great professor and Ian was an amazing TF.","On the one hand, it's really cool. You spend weeks on Fourier theory, and it feels like you've really understood something. Almost in your bones. And you're introduced to numerical tools that you code yourself. You get the theory and practice. On the other hand, as an undergrad I found it incredibly difficult. I had to tell myself at one point that it was okay not to understand everything. The most important thing is to put the time into the psets. That's where the learning happens. Jim was a really cool teacher. I appreciated that he would share the tricks of the trade that he's a part of. And Ian was a fantastic TF. Great at explaining concepts and so generous with his time.","Do you want to learn about probability, scientific computing, fitting data, or Fourier transforms? If yes, this is your class! You will learn all you ever wanted to know about these topics and more.","This is a great class that will teach you a lot of practical statistics and data analysis topics that you need for observational astronomy and may not have formally learned anywhere else. Definitely take this class if you plan to do any kind of observational astrophysics project."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.21","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"18","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ASTRON 193","course_id":"275","cat_num":"4495","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"7","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ASTRON 193","course_id":"275","cat_num":"4495","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ASTRON 193","course_id":"275","cat_num":"4495","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
