This is real stuff that people should know about.","These are some of the books you definitely want to read before graduation. Prof Hankins does a great job of exploring the relevance and the historical quirks of these timeless thinkers.","This is a fantastic class, but it is a lot of reading and a lot of information being thrown at you. The professor is occasionally hard to follow but clearly incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material. Just make sure you stay on top of things (and go to lecture!) or this class will overwhelm you, but it's a great class and very much worth taking.","This is an excellent course for students of history, philosophy, and Social Studies; Intellectual history is at the margins of these disciplines, and provides great insight into each of them. Hankins is an incredible lecturer, Michael is a wonderful TF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if you make the effort to meet with him during office hours, and the course is challenging without being overwhelming. This course is manageable for students with little experience in history and philosophy, but should be helpful even to students with considerable background."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This is the sort of course you need to take at Harvard.  It covers a wide range of great thinkers, and Prof. Hankins is very good and explaining their complex philosophical ideas.  Do not miss this opportunity!","The lectures can feel a bit dry, but at the end of the day, the class teaches really valuable material about Western thought.  The reading list is incredible.","Incredibly interesting course. highly recommended.","Attend for exemplary lectures.","This is a must-take course for really anyone. I think this material is so important to know for any field.","This class is pretty good, be warned though that lecture can sometimes be a bit dull.","Excellent class, either as an introduction to Intellectual History, as a gen ed, or as an unusual and stimulating elective in which you read essential thinkers. Professor Hankins is deeply committed to teaching and Michael was a phenomenal TF. The visit to Houghton alone justifies taking the class. It is, however, extremely easy, almost too much so at times.","Take it. If you shop it and the first few lectures seem boring, don't be scared. Hankins is insanely knowledgeable and keeps the class loose, and will grow on you a lot. The course is low stress and runs through a selection of works that are surprisingly and consistently fascinating.","This is an incredible class if you want exposure to some of the major themes of Western Philosophy.","This is a fantastic course that will give you a broad overview of pre-modern to early modern philosophy. It is very fast-paced, so make sure to keep up on your reading. But you will learn a lot. James Hankins is a fantastic lecturer, and he is more than willing to talk with any undergrad about their ideas or interpretations.","This is the best course I have taken at Harvard so far. It has changed my intellectual perspective and outlook on the world more than any other class I have taken. After the two-semester series, you will have read 22 of the most pertinent works of philosophy, and you will have gained a concise yet coherent understanding of the evolution of thought and philosophy during the two millenia. My biggest complaint is that professor Hankins does not offer a third part that explores modern thought!! Take His1300 beforehand, if you can.","I enjoyed reading the authors in this course, but it can be tough to differentiate between them, especially without a solid background in the history of the time period.","Take this class! The lectures are phenomenal, and the readings tough but worth it.  I learned so much, and feel like I'm walking away from this class a changed person, with a new awareness of the limitations of my own modes of thought.  This is probably the best class I've taken at Harvard; I only wish I could have taken it sooner.","This is a great way to read and understand some really important thinkers! Take it!","This was one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is a great way to learn about some of the greatest philosophers in Western history, and the professor is amazing!","Take it if you have some history background and like the subject matter.","It was really interesting and gives you the discourse to discuss philosophers intelligently, but lectures are a bit dry (not much of a reason to go if you read the handouts online) and its important to remember that this is a HISTORY course so you'll mostly be discussing the intellectual foundation of philosophical movements rather than the ideas themselves.","This is an absolute gem of a course.  Actually learn about a ton of influential\/famous thinkers and their works in a historical context (Thomas Aquinas, More, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, etc), while taking on a totally manageable workload.","You gotta read this shit and know these mofos. This class is an entertaining and efficient way to do it.","This course has given me tools of understanding which I know I'm going to use in many other courses and in daily life. It is extremely worth your time. Professor Hankins is a really engaging lecturer.","Very enjoyable course if you have some interest in Medieval history.","The class material is fascinating, and though the lectures are dense, the professor is accessible and you will learn as much as you put into the class.  (Un)fortunately there are only response papers, a midterm, and a final.","You only get out as much as you put in, but its totally worth it. It will revolutionize your understanding of Western philosophy.","This is a great course; interesting material and an engaging teaching staff leaves you with serious knowledge.","Be prepared to do the work and stay on top of it"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.58","workload":"2.08","difficulty":"2.83","recommendation":"4.67","enrollment":"40","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1301","course_id":"2412","cat_num":"7573","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"9","5s":"24"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1301","course_id":"2412","cat_num":"7573","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"23","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1301","course_id":"2412","cat_num":"7573","1s":"5","2s":"23","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
