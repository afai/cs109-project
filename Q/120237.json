Professor Valiant creates a collaborative, seminar-like environment in which we discuss research topics such as evolvability, computational neuroscience, network stability, and self-assembly. I've learned tremendously from this course. Students present some of the topics in the papers and are given very helpful feedback the after lectures. The final project is another strength of the course - you may choose your own topic as long as it's related to the course and you may find a topic to pursue in your thesis. I recommend with enthusiasm the course and I would very much enjoy taking another research course with Professor Valiant in the future.","Professor Valiant is wonderful, though be forewarned of the course's format: many of the lectures are student-led, and their quality and clarity will depend upon the quality of students in the course.","Students make the course. If you have a good group, you will enjoy it. Low work, low stress, interesting topics.","The class is an easy way of satisfying your concentration requirement, but not terribly much else."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The topics class in theoretical CS (even though it's mostly theoretical math, but well, that's better for me since I'm a math person) is a wonderful opportunity to do some exciting problems\/readings\/research, and can easily turn into the beginnings of a thesis\/research paper (if you're an undergraduate). If you have strong preparation in math, don't worry about the required background too much; even if you're not sure if the year's topic suits your interests, give it a try for a couple of weeks!","As a graduating senior, this is by far the hardest class I've ever taken. That being said, I learned an incredible amount in a short period of time, and I feel like I have a much firmer grasp on CS theory in general.","Material is tough and readings very dense. Salil explains  stuff well in class, but its just really tough if you arent extremely into math\/theoretical cs. Material is cutting edge but not that applicably interesting imo","As in many 200-level CS courses, you read papers and produce an original final research project. These courses are great training in research for interested undergrads. Unlike some of the other courses, this one does not spend time discussing \"how to read research papers\" or \"how to produce research\". For that reason, it might be suitable for a more experience\/more mature undergrad. Differential privacy is a great research area for young people because it recruits insights from many fields of CS and has many accessible open problems. This is a great course to expand your general skillset.","This class is an excellent introduction to a cutting-edge research field.  Without assuming any prior knowledge of differential privacy, the course ends up reading papers on the subject that were published in the last couple of years.  It's also a great chance to try pursuing a small research project.  \r\n\r\nThis is a rotating topics course, so it may vary a bit from year to year.  Any course taught by Salil is well worth taking and should be both challenging and highly rewarding.","I would take this class if you enjoy theoretical proofs.","Differential privacy is an interesting topic in theoretical computer science with plenty of connections to other areas. I very much enjoyed the course. It wasn't too difficult or time consuming, although the final project was harder than I expected. Make sure you are comfortable with proofs and probability theory if you are taking this course.","Salil and Jon were both great instructors.  Their lectures were really clear and they clearly cared about the students a lot and made our lives focused on learning.  This course was cool in that it started from the beginning but got us to a point that we felt like we could do research in differential privacy."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Cs229r changes every year. In general, take this course if you're\r\n1) excited about the topic; and\r\n2) have the mathematical maturity required (which can also vary)\r\nAs for algorithms for big data, there are many parts to this course, and each has a different flavor to it. My advice would be to check out the other topics (especially dimensionality reduction, which was a major part of this year's big data algorithms 229r) in addition to going to shopping week.","Be prepared to do a lot of work. The psets are generally easy to write up, once you solve it; solving it may take hours of staring at a blank piece of paper. However, the tools and techniques covered are very cutting-edge, and I have already found applications of them in my research.","The material is recent, interesting, and well-motivated. And there's cool math. Jelani is super cool, and very approachable and helpful.","Excellent course. Well worth taking if Jelani Nelson is teaching.","If you're interested in sketching, streaming, or numerical linear algebra, I don't think you're going to get a better introduction than this course. The material is not easy though, so definitely plan on putting time into the problem sets and final projects.","Cool class! But..pretty hard, lots of work.","I learned a lot about state-of-the-art in big data algorithms, picking up useful analytical tools (in linear algebra, probability, complexity analysis) on the way.","A lot of topics are gone over, but often incredibly quickly. The amount you get out of this class will hugely depend on how much time u spend on it outside of class.","Jelani knows his stuff. Great class. Lecture can be difficult to follow, but one can learn by supplementing the lecture by reading the papers presented during the lecture privately as well.","Jelani's a good lecturer, and the material in the course is generally quite interesting. However, I would not recommend it to students interested in more algorithms similar to the ones in (for example) CS124 - the algorithms in this course are mostly probabilistic, and working with them does not \"feel\" similar to working with typical algorithms (there are some exceptions to this though)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"19","response rate":"78.95","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 229r","course_id":"1262","cat_num":"3730","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 229r","course_id":"1262","cat_num":"3730","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"8","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 229r","course_id":"1262","cat_num":"3730","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"8","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
