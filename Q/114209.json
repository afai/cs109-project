Block off as much time in your schedule this semester as you can because you will use it.","This course is very useful if you are a practicing organic chemist. If you just curious about how molecules are made, I'd be wary to jump into this course. This course is very difficult, and requires a lot of time outside of class to complete the problem sets and prepare for exams."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["It is nearly impossible to succeed in this course without having either taken the Harvard introductory organic sequence or an intensive synthesis course at another university. Generally, over 30 hours of work per week were required outside of this course to complete the problem sets and have any chance of understanding the material. At the end of the course, only graduate students in organic chemistry and a small number of undergraduate students remained, the majority having dropped before the first test. The course is taught for the students who already understand everything, leaving everyone else far, far behind.","If you plan on doing total synthesis (or maybe you are more into organic methods, but there are no better options of courses to take at the time) then take this. It is not a \"general interest\" type of course though, you have to like thinking about synthetic problems to be able to handle it.","it's likely too intense for most undergrads. nonetheless, anyone who puts the work into the class will come out a much better synthetic chemist. well, hypothetically.","If you want to do organic chemistry, you can't miss it.","It's a good background of attacking synthetic problems as a researcher, but overall the class lacks mechanistic structure.","Only take this course if you need it for your research, and even then, make sure you are prepared."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Take it if very seriously interested in organic synthesis.  Otherwise, other courses will likely teach you as much without taking over your life.","Only take it if you are excited about organic synthesis, then it's great. In doubt - leave it out!","great course.","This class is very difficult and time-consuming, and only those with a strong interest in doing total synthesis should take it. The teaching is not the best."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course was by far the most challenging course I have ever taken; however, I have learned more than I ever imagined. I would recommend this course to any scientist interested in rigorous synthesis.","If you have any interest in organic synthesis, this class is an incredible experience.  However, it is easy to fall behind and lose confidence as the amount of material builds up.","Highly recommend to those with substantial background in organic chemistry.","This course is for students that want to view actual problems in organic synthesis. It is best for those who want to apply their knowledge, which should be VERY profound. It is a time-consuming, yet very encouraging course, but probably only if you are really interested in organic synthesis. If you are you should definitely take it.","You will learn so much from this class. Organic chemistry is pretty awesome.","This class requires a lot of work but is very well organized and offers plenty of support, making it very manageable. Definitely a must for anyone considering doing synthetic chemistry.","Perhaps one of the most difficult courses in the department, this class is a must for any student seriously studying organic chemistry. Lectures are excellent and engaging. The teaching staff is dedicated and incredibly knowledgeable. This class is very rigorous and demanding, but it is well worth the effort. Students come away with a massively expanded ability to tackle difficult synthetic problems. A note to undergraduates: this course is hard, and perhaps intimidating; however, I would strongly encourage you to take it. The knowledge you will gain greatly outweighs any hits your GPA might take provided that you are willing to work diligently.","expect to work hard and spend lots of time on P-sets","In this class, you will work hard, but you will learn a ton!  This class is an intensive study in synthesis and will require much reading and becoming familiar with named reactions and the art of retrosynthetic analysis.  As a result, students will learn a ton and be comfortable in working synthetic problems, an essential skill for any organic chemist."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Even if you've seen synthesis before, you haven't seen it like this.","The course is fantastic and well organized, but of course also time consuming.  You won't get much out of it if you can't put aside enough time, so plan your schedule accordingly.","This class is undoubtedly the most difficult class I have ever taken, but it was also one of the most rewarding.  Expect to spend 20+ hours per problem set, but struggling with these problems is the most effective way to become better at retrosynthetic analysis and planning asymmetric syntheses.  Prof. Myers is a great lecturer, but be prepared to be put on the spot during class.","This is a challenging class, but very rewarding. If you are willing to put effort in to study the material, then you will get a lot out of the class.","This course is absolutely outstanding.  It is also hard.  That being said, as long as you are willing to commit time to it and work hard at it, you will be fine and you will learn an enormous amount of chemistry.  It was one of the best classes I've taken.","It is one of the most difficult but most useful class you'll ever take, if you can make it all the way through. Only take it if you're committed to working hard.","It's important to know what you're trying to get out of this course before taking it. Unless you're interested in spending a large part of your life making small molecules, taking CHEM115 may just mean putting in a whole lot of effort to develop skills that you'll forget in a few months. But if you really want to understand organic synthetic chemistry as it's actually practiced, this course will prepare you about as well as you can hope for in a classroom setting. It's definitely a beast of a course, and you should be prepared to expend a lot of mental energy on problem sets and exams, but you will learn a lot over the course of this semester. Just make sure that you have a use for that knowledge -- as Myers says at the start of the semester, taking CHEM115 is similar to taking an upper-level foreign language course, and there aren't too many native speakers of organic synthesis.","Anyone who wants to learn about organic synthesis should definitely take this class, as long as they can commit a substantial amount of time to it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHEM 115","course_id":"490","cat_num":"0480","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHEM 115","course_id":"490","cat_num":"0480","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHEM 115","course_id":"490","cat_num":"0480","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"5"}},"success":true}
