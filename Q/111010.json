Even in getting the notes from someone, you may not be able to entirely understand the concepts that were explained in class.","It's work.  It's difficult.  But if you are willing to put in the time, there are resources (like section, the Math Question Center,. and your peers) that are there to help you.","This was a good review of high school calculus and then some.","It's a pretty terrible class, but there's NO ALTERNATIVE so just try to get through it.","This is a very difficult and time-consuming course.","It is a great class and the work load is reasonable.","It is a bit difficult but a great and detailed way to learn Calc II.","This is a very difficult course, whether you took BC Calc or AB Calc.","The concepts are basic calculus concepts that everyone should learn, however the homework is unnecessarily difficult","Focus on the homework and it is best to check hw with others as some people may get certain concepts better than others.","The workload is a bit confusing, but if they take the initiative to learn by assigning themselves more work than what is assigned in class they will do well.","Even if you've already taken Calculus BC and done really well, that means nothing in this class. Most days in class were \"review\" for me because I'd learned the material in high school, but I'm still not doing as well as I would like in the class.","I realize now that as I never want to take math again, I shouldn't have taken this course. I only took it because none of the math cores sounded interesting so I thought I could handle taking straightforward calculus again, especially because I'd already had two years of it. I think I underestimated my calculus abilities. I wouldn't tell anyone to take this class if they weren't interested in continuing in math or science, which in retrospect seems pretty obvious.","if you like math and are prepared to work at it, this is the class for you","If you would like to take more math, this is the way to do it. The instructors make some difficult concepts as painless as possible. The course is very worthwhile if you put in the time to do problem sets and really understand the math. The MQC is an incredible resource you should plan on taking advantage of.","Use the Math Question Center!","Take advantage of all of the help and resources.","Come to Math 1B ready for a new outlook on concepts. Although some topics are an aparent review from high school calculus classes, they are presented in a more critical light and therefore problems require much more of you than high school calculus problems.","Some of the material can be challenging, but it will be useful for future math classes.","It is a tough course, it has difficult problem sets and the midterms are very difficult. For a core, I should not have taken the class.","Take it if you need it for higher-level math courses or if you like the material.","If the class must be taken, or you already know the material, take it -but if you feel unprepared or are on the edge, definitely find an alternative.","Meet with the TF to be concrete with the concepts.","Having an additional calculus textbook was useful.  Take advantage of the Math Question Center.","It moves very quickly! Even if you have taken BC Calculus and are familiar with the material, it is very difficult.","Expect to be confused, but know that everyone else is, too. Use the Math Question Center! It's a life saver!","It's gonna be tough, but if you like math, it could be worth it","If you are shooting for the Math 19 or 20 just take 1a and skip this class.","Good if you haven't taken AB Calc","If you are going to need math in your vocation, I'd suggest this class.","The course covers a lot of material.  I would tell future students not to hesitate to seek help; the Math Question Center is a great place to work on problem sets even if you don't have questions necessarily.  Use your resources and be disciplined with getting your work done.  When it comes time for exams, just review your problem sets, notes, and do some practice problems.","Be prepared for long nights at the Math Question Center for extra help","Only take it if you have to for your concentration requirement","It was a good and necessary class to further your math studies, but your satisfaction with the class depends largely on the section leader.","It's a very straightforward and well-structured math class. The staff is great.","make sure you can understand math if you're going to take this course.","Take the class for your concentration requirements.  If it is not required, it is not worth the time.","Only take this class if you have to... or you are a math concentrator.","Take it if you have to...but if you dont..DONT!","Problem sets are time consuming but there are so many resources available for help.","Pray for grade weighting.","It was extremely difficult regardless of what anyone tells you. \r\nTake Math 21a and skip this one. Major mistake on my part.","This class provides a good foundation for students planning to study math in future semesters.","The class itself is as good as the TF makes it, but the material is enjoyable.","I am likely to recommend as long as your are confident in your math skills and have taken AP Calculus BC","You should take it because it will make you cool.","Don't take this class until you know everything before it WELL","do not take course unless absolutely necessary for some future goal, unsure about how to apply material, does not seem to work towards a necessary goal","This class provided both a great extension of previous calculus and an excellent foundation for future math classes.","If you test higher, don't take it even if someone tells you that you have to. Most of it will probably be review, even of AB calculus.","Be prepared to seek outside help- It is hard to really understand the materials as well as you're expected to for exams just by attending classes.","Start going to the Math Question Center from the beginning. Don't waste any points on your homework by taking the chance that you may have gotten a problem wrong. Making your homework average as good as possible is something that is much easier to do that scoring 100% on all the exams.","If you are willing to study the material, you'll be fine, but if you're looking for a simple math class, this isn't for you.","Difficult, not as easy as your high school calculus class","Unless you are really interested in math, I'm not sure how applicable the things that you learn in this course are for other subjects, like economics.","It's pretty fast paced, but there are helpful resources in your TF's, CA's, and the Math question center, so if you stay on top of things and seek out help when you need it, you will do fine in the course.","only take the course if you have to. it is not very fun.","Don't fall behind","Take this class if you need to take a math class, but only if you have a strong background with calculus. I would not simply take this class for an elective or for the sake of taking a math class.","It could have been taught better, and the course doesn't seem very applicable to life-situations.","It's not a fun class, but if you need to take it for concentration requirements, you'll just have to grit your teeth and do it.  Don't take this class as an elective, unless you really like calculus.","Despite the relative ease of concepts, the mastery expected of you is immense and should not be underestimated.","This is a fairly difficult class due to the fast pace at which it is taught.  To do well, more outside work (than other classes) is probably necessary to understand the material.  Even having taken Calculus BC, this course may prove to be somewhat difficult.","Do not underestimate the difficulty of this course, or any math course at Harvard.","The class is relatively little work and will definitely shine some light on those concepts from BC Calc that were unclear. The only real problems with the course are the exams, but they will most likely curve them at the end anyway.","This class was a good starting point if you are interested in concentrating in Mathematics.","don't take this course just because you've already taken bc calc in high school and you think it's going to be an easy review. this course is actually very hard and you'll find yourself becoming more and more frustrated throughout the course of the semester","That the workload is hard, but the material is doable. The pace at which topics are learned throughout the semester is quick, which can be difficult at times.","Great class that strengthens a student's ability to effectively reason and solve problems","this class sucks.  if you've had BC in high school, don't dash yourself on the rocks to get a review here, because it will destroy you.  instead, just go on to multivariable, which is rumored to be an easier and better course.","do your homework on a consistent basis and the course is easy.","This isn't an easy class, but it is worthwhile if you are interested in math.","If you have to take, I am sorry.  It is in my opinion a poorly taught class, but the material is important for most science concentrators and especially for pre-meds, so you just have to get through it.","Stay caught up from the beginning.  The learning is cumulative and if you get behind at the beginning, it truly all piles up.","I think that if you have taken either AP calc AB or IB methods SL, I would highly recommend the rigor that ths class brings; it is a good segue into harvard math and general numerical fluency.","the work is often demanding, especially around exam time. attending the review sessions is key to doing well on exams","The assignments are very long, and some of the problems are almost impossible to do without help from the MQC or from your TF.","Don't take this class. Avoid it any way you can - try to get into 21a or 19a, even if you don't feel prepared. What you learn in this course isn't worth the time, frustration, and confusion it causes.\r\n\r\nGiven a second chance, I would do anything I could to avoid Math 1b. It is simply an awful course, no matter how they tried to structure it. Because of it, I will never take another non-statistics math class at Harvard.","It's interesting, but it can be a bit difficult at times.","You are going to move at a much quicker pace and cover a lot more material than previous math courses that you have taken.","I dislike math very much, but despite that, I learned a lot of useful mathematical concepts that will help me throughout life.","This class requires doing practice problems on your own in addition to the homework assigned as well as reading the textbook at times to understand concepts.","Try to find a TF that is great at explaining the material","Though excellently taught, the material for this course is presented in a dry, procedural manner. The course does little to actively encourage interest in Mathematics or stimulate excitement, and essentially constantly introduces new material, never quite having enough time to pause and see why material is important. This being the first Math course I've taken at Harvard, I wouldn't want to take another, except that I need to in order to fulfill requirements.","I would not take this class unless it was necessary for a concentration.","AP Calculus BC is NOT the same as Math 1b. Math 1b will cover significantly more!!!!","I would advise students to find another way around taking this class if they need it for a pre-med requirement. Definitely DO NOT take to fill QR core.","Do not take the 1.5 hour option. The last half hour is death. Seriously. The course becomes fractured as a result. Better to have math on a Friday than spend your weekend trying to figure out what in god's name you covered.","Interesting.","teaching staff is great.","Be prepared for a lot of work and remember that despite the title of the class, the course material is difficult.","Be prepared to work hard and consistently-- the exams can be very difficult. Don't merely hope that something you don't fully understand won't be on the test, because chances are it will be. Above all, past exams are a godsend! Use them! Ask your TFs to put more up on the website and do as many as you can before the tests to help you get a sense of what the exams will actually be like.","Forming a study group to help conquer the problem sets and offer new ideas and insights into challenging problems would be very helpful.  Also, if you realize within the first couple classes that you're going to have a miserable time in the course with the section and TF you were assigned to, see if you can change section times and TFs--it could make all the difference.","Caution. Though the material is manageable, the course is taught at lot harder than it should be.","only take it if you have to.","The class is not difficult at all but good preparation is needed for the exams.","Everything is so much easier if you go to class.","I would urge students to utilize the system- Office hours, MQC, section.  Don't struggle out of pride.  There are people that are willing to help you!","It's...interesting. A lot of work. And Professor Munson will most likely not be teaching it after next semester. :(","Only take this class if it is required for a concentration or you have a great interest in it. Otherwise, it can be painful.","It's more difficult than I though it would be. The sections are a bit hard to follow but this course is definitely doable with a little extra studying outside of the classroom. It's a decent amount of work but not too much.","It's a fun course depending on your TF. Hopefully you'll have smart people in your class. There's also a lot of pointless homework assignments.","It is harder and moves much faster than I expected, so don't take it if you don't like math. However, it's not impossible to handle.","Don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. I made the mistake of taking this course for my QR because the Math Department placement test suggested it to me. This course is also the clearest example of the bureaucracy and inefficiency of the Math Department.","This was a good class to review topics learned in Calculus AB and to add on to that knowledge.  It was not a terribly difficult class, especially with the help of the Math Question Center, but it was still challenging.  I feel better prepared now to enter a higher level math class.","like an extention of highschool IB MATH HIGHER LEVEL","I think it is run very well, and I learned a lot, but sometimes I feel as though the course doesn't emphasize what the concepts we were learning meant.  For example, I was taught how to create a phase plane, but it was never clear what the phase plane meant and how I could interpret it.","Take it if you are places into it, or have taken Calc BC. But be prepared to work your butt off.","To go to the MQC and Office Hours. I would stress it highly. A lot of outside help will be needed for this course unless you have a higher background in Calculus.","It's a lot of homework, but very organized and gives you a solid background in calculus","I did not enjoy the class at all, and I like math.","for me this class was difficult","Take this course if you are confident with precal and calculus","It is quite possibly of the most challenging classes at Harvard, but it may also be one of the most necessary for science concentrators.","It is a good class if you want to go farther into calculus but not get into the multivariable part.  There are also lots of resources to turn too if you feel overwhelmed by the course material.  It is not the most interesting class, but it teaches a very valuable skill.","it is a great class for understanding the applications of calculus in the real world.  however, there is very little theory involved, and much more computation","Take this class seriously","use the summer school website for DE explanations","This is a challenging but engaging and straightforward calculus class. A good springboard for future, more difficult courses.","I really enjoyed the subject matter of this class even though it was rather difficult and required a lot of time each week.

As long as you put forth  the effort, you should do fine in this class","Moves somewhat fast, solid AB is needed","This class was very instructive and I was able to learn a lot from the instructors.","This course is a solid second year calculus course.  You will be challenged throughout the course but everything in terms of exams and homework is fair.","Although there was extensive help available, it was hard to know what you were required to know. However, there was definitely help available, whether you chose to go for it or not.","if you are going to concentrate on something that needs a strong math background take the class in order to have the calculus groundwork you need","Math 1B is a mass-taught class taken mostly to get requirements out of the way. Thus it is boring and perfunctory, with very little emphasis on learning the background behind the topics covered and more emphasis on just learning how to use formulas. Section lectures can be pointless and the textbook is useless. Use CA sections, office hours, and the MQC to do the homework because it will invariably have nothing to do with what was taught in lecture.","the subject material isn't necessarily difficult, but the method of teaching leaves very little room for taking time to absorb the material...it turns into a learn and regurgitate process, instead of a learn and understand process","go to MQC often, and study group is always helpful","Be careful of coming into this class thinking it is easy judging by the starting material. Yes, while the starting material may be a review of subjects covered recently, the work does get harder and more difficult to understand.","This class is a difficult class and the homework was demanding at times; I wouldn't suggest taking this class, unless you really need to take it for a requirement."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["Take Math 1b if you want to being using real applications of mathematics.","The course material can be very difficult to understand, and the grading can run anywhere between lenient and harsh.","It has been the hardest math class I have taken my entire life.","Hope you don't get David Harvey.","It is very important to spend a lot of time on each assigned problem set.","This course requires a lot of work and logical thinking, albeit my section leader and calculus coach were very understanding, and helped me whenever and however I had trouble with things.","Great teaching and interesting material.","stay away take 21 a instead","I would tell people to avoid this course at all costs.  It is a terrible class and nothing comes out of it but misery and despair.","Good coverage of basic essential math, relatively painless.","There is lots of work outside of class and concept understanding that you must struggle to do on your own.","This course is time-consuming and difficult to follow, but is also an interesting foray into a deeper way of looking at math.","very rewarding class if you put in the work","Sometimes it is difficult to get a good grasp on the material, and certain problems can definitely seem frustrating, but in the end you will emerge with a good understanding of calculus, which is very useful.","So hard, so time consuming, very discouraging.","It's an ok course - kind of a must for Pre-med, Math, or Science. If you want an essay QR, this was ok. Don't expect it to be easy - I spent a decent amount of time on this when I felt I could have taken a better course that would have been more valuable.

It's not that I did poorly in the course (at all) but to be honest, it was FAR too much work.  In other words, DO NOT take this course if you're just taking it for the QR core (unless you really love Calc and hours of homework every other night).","It's a very good course where you can develop understandings of integration, series, and differential equation, and learn to apply it to real life situations.","My advice is to go to as many problem sessions as possible because everyone explains things differently and you just have to find the explanation that you understand the most.","This class should be taken only if students want to continue on with higher level math.","If they figured out how to teach this class, it would be helpful, but otherwise I would tell them only to take it if they are going to need these skills in future classes they take at school.","This is a great class.

There is so much support for you in this course that there really is no reason not to do well if you are willing to put in the time and effort to use the resources offered. Take advantage of your section leader's office hours and go to MQC! Both resources are so helpful.","It develops your mathematics in a necessary way at a manageable pace.  A very well crafted stepping stone if you want to continue with math or science here.","Awesome TFs and CAs, awesome class! The material gets a little challenging at times, so if you hated calculus in high school, you probably shouldn't take this for your Quant Reasoning requirement. Honestly though, the homework is very reasonable, the support network is just plain great, and you are given all the help you could POSSIBLY want to do well in this class, so maybe this will be the class where you fall in love with calculus. Make use of the MQC and office hours, they are super helpful.","Excellent course. Many many resources. Awesome teaching staff. Don't take though if you have taken Calc BC because you shouldn't waste a semester before 21a. Challenging course but impossible to do poorly because of many extra credit opportunities.","Take it! Even if you're a sophomore. I feel so much more confident in my math abilities after this!","This is a pretty standard math course. It's pretty big so the section scheduling options are pretty good. The exams are returned quickly and it has a lot of available resources.","This class is the best math class I have ever taken, and this is definitely thanks to Professor Gottlieb and her awesome teaching staff. They provided us with so many resources, awesome review sessions, note summaries online, lots of office hours, a math question center staffed by dedicated CAs... There was also an incredible number of opportunities to get extra credit and even to retake a test. I could just tell they wanted everyone to succeed. Furthermore, Professor Gottlieb is the most awesome math professor I ever had. Whenever I walked out of section, I felt like everything was already engraved in my mind and ready to use since it had been taught to me so well. I had never learned anything taught in math 1b before, and yet the class felt easier than 1a (even though I was a lot more familiar with the material taught in 1a). Honestly it was one of the best academic experiences I have had at Harvard in two years, and I am not even a math\/science concentrator.","As long as you stay up on the material, you'll be fine.","only take it if you have to","very work intensive class, but also very manageable because there are many people you can go to if you are struggling","Math 1b is organized very well, and is taught very well. TF's are also very accessible and knowledgable on calculus. I think this course is a great course to give a strong foundation for college mathematics. I took Math 1a in the fall, and that in combination with 1b had taught me infinitely more than I learned in high school calculus. I also think taking 1a and 1b are beneficial to getting you acquainted with college math courses.","The course is taught well. The assignments require thought but are fair.","You learn a lot, but it is a lot of work.","Robin's class was very well organized and students had all of the resources they needed to succeed","Make the most of the MQC and definitely use the office hours!","Only take this course if you need it. 3 psets a week is very time consuming.","The TFs really want you to do well, but be prepared for a tough course with a lot of course work if you're not a math whiz!","three p-sets a week is annoying as hell and the material is boring. it's a requirement for a lot of classes, so you'll need to take it. thankfully it's not too hard and as long as you study, you'll do well on the tests. the p-sets are NO indication of the exams. just do your work and you're pretty much guaranteed a decent grade.","THIS IS THE BEST MATH CLASS I HAVE TAKEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  I absolutely loved math 1b, and it was definitely my favorite class this semester.  It seems like a lot of work with three problem sets a week, but it's a lot fun and by the end of the semester, the work it worth it.","This is a hurdle you have to take in order to be an ec honors major and a requirement for most other social sciences so its a really terrible situation that you just have to put up with. Sad actually that harvard makes you go through such a terrible experience but I guess that's just the way it has to be.","Take this class instead of Math1a!  It is taught much better and I enjoyed this course more.  Weirdly, 1b is more manageable and easier than Math 1a...","It's a big time commitment with the amount of problem sets we have, but as long as you find a steady group of people to finish them with, then it shouldn't be too bad, especially with the MQC around. The exams are pretty reasonable, but definitely require some practice. And you get a feeling from all the teachers that they genuinely want you to understand the material and do well.","Math 1b expects you to understand that fundamental theory behind each of the modules.  Be sure you have a firm grasp of this prior to walking into the midterm.","This class can definitely be taken after only taking AP calc AB","If you want to learn basic calculus, this course does a bang up job.","I would tell them that it is pretty challenging, but if you study and go to office hours, you will do fine.","This class is not as bad as people make it out to be. The workload is not extremely demanding but you do have to put in the work if you want to see the results. Stay up with the home works and going to class helps a lot","Be prepared for a lot of homework.","Like all math classes way too many problems to do. However, depending on your instructor you will understand the material quite easily. Exams are a pain though.","Porbably only take it as a concentration requirement, but it's pretty manageable","Robin is a fabulous instructor, and the material, while difficult, is explained in a clear and understandable manner.  This class, in my opinion, is easier than 1a, but only because of the course organization and teaching, and not the material.","This was a tough course but very easily manageable and useful for the future.","Decent class- the teachers really try and help you do the best you possibly can but if you are competent in integration and functions and don't enjoy theoretical math, I would suggest going ahead to applied math.","You would have to spend a lot of time on this class, including sitting at the MQC a lot.","The teaching staff is incredibly supportive.  If you need help, there are many places where you can go to receive the help that you need!","It's harder than it looks. Get a tutor if you can because the resources are not sufficient.","This class is as good as you make it to be.  The TF's and class resources are plentiful and very useful, but you need to seek out and use them.  The only way you can get the full experience from Math 1b is from active engagement.","It is necessary for building your mathematics foundation.","I think it is a well done class, but there is a lot of work required to complete the 3 p-sets due every week.","Be ready for all the problem sets. They're designed to challenge you and they're going to keep coming until the end of the semester. Don't get behind on your work or not pay attention in class because then you'll be doubly behind because each separate class is also a unique topic in itself. Not understanding something from the previous day's lecture will impact your understanding of the day's lesson as well!","This course is so much fun; engaging sections, problem sets that allow you to both practice techniques and discover new concepts, and well-written exams make this class really enjoyable.","this is an awesome class because it allows you to think logically and the section on series helps with you argumentative skills because you literally argue for why you take a stance on whether a series will converge or not","Take advantage of the resources that are available, especially the practice tests; otherwise the first test may take you by surprise, because it's more difficult that the homework assignments as it requires a higher level of thinking.","There is a lot of homework. However, I learned a lot and was probably the best math class I've taken.","You really learn a lot about math and gain a great understanding about the techniques behind Calculus.","LIGHTYEARS better than 1a. class\/homework\/exams are very fair and actually test what you learned in section! 3 psets a week can be annoying, but you will realize that it's actually really beneficial...","Lots of psets! Robin Gottleib is a fantastic teacher though and her book corresponds with lecture and is easy to read so read it if you miss class and you should be okay!","The class is taught entirely in section, which I found to be very helpful for learning the material.","This class is time-consuming and difficult for those who have not taken the material before, but it is worth it.","I really loved this course because it challenged me and expanded my outlook on mathematics.","seek help when the going gets tough","Your TF can break or make this course for you... If you don't like his\/her teaching method go to other ppl's office hours!","A lot of work, but a great class!","There is a lot of busy work, and your experience depends highly on your teaching fellow.","the material is manageable the workload and time commitment is the hard part","When I was in Math 1a, a lot of my friends told me that Math 1b is better, and it is true.

If you are unsure about taking 21a and 1b, 1b will give you a great foundation and will make you feel comfortable with math at Harvard and confident in your abilities. The exams are fair and there are great preparatory materials online. Overall, I would highly recommend this course!","While this class is time consuming, it is definitely one of the best taught and structured classes that I have ever taken.","This class is a good class for incoming students to take with background up to AP AB Calculus. I did not take AP BC Calculus, but still felt prepared and managed the workload quite nicely.","Waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much homework but exams are fair.","This class takes a lot of hours","This class gives you a firm understanding of calculus while moving at a reasonable pace.

Take advantage of MQC and office hours.","Take this course if you placed into it. Do not skip it and take 21a.","It is a great class if you have an awesome TF like I did.  Most of the TF's are great, but some are better than others.  I really enjoyed the concepts and have a fuller understanding of math in general, but my grade was rather low due to mistakes in algebra.","This course is the best mathematics course I have ever taken. I had Jameel as a TF and his teaching style was excellent.","Do your homework, pay attention in section and take advantage of all the extra help opportunities!","It sucks, but you're going to take it anyway. Because you're most likely premed.","If you are thinking about math and you have done some calc before but need a reminder this is the course for you.","Most people who take this need it as a requirement for something else anyway, but if you don't and are on the fence, please take it.","Standard intro math class - somewhat interesting, but usually pretty boring, somewhat difficult, but easier if you have time to go to office hours and the MQC and do extra credit, somewhat helpful, in that you can take upper level classes after this, but also not sure where you will ever use this math again outside of a math class.","This class is not impossible, but it requires time to process and really learn the material. It can't just be memorized overnight.","I took this class to get a better feel for math at Harvard before jumping into 21 and thought it was a good course. It is really set up for you to succeed if you want to with an extra credit project, tons of OH, and EC HW problems. I had a friend who jumped right to 21 (we both took BC calc in HS but didn't take math at all Freshman year and as a result lost pretty much all knowledge) and he did say it was manageable\/all you need from 1b is integration techniques, but I would recommend what I did.","This class is an excellent math option.  It is a general calculus class that is somehow made tremendously enjoyable and quite applicable to real life.  Overall, the structure is very conducive to learning the material in an interesting manner.","This class is very well taught. You will learn a lot if you put the time in. 3 psets a week may seem like a lot but the TFs are fantastic and you will learn the material. It is a decent amount of work early on but later in the semester it's not as bad. If you have AP Calc AB background then you will be fine.","I am not a math person, but this was the best math math class that I have ever taken.  I really learned a lot, and there was always support if you needed it.  Exams were extremely fair compared to some of the other tests that I took this semester.","a lot of work, reasonable tests","TAKE THIS CLASS!!! time consuming, but very fair","I had already taken BC in high school and found that this course did a much better job of ensuring students understood the process and reasoning behind the math we did. While I had seen most of the material already, I still learned a lot in terms of how to approach a problem and different problem solving techniques.","It's not a course I would take for fun, but it was not the disaster that some describe it as.  I wouldn't say I loved it, but I definitely didn't mind doing problem sets or going to class.  The teaching staff was really helpful, as was my CA.  Tests were not unreasonable - the effort you put into studying was clearly reflected in your results.","This class very much augmented my understanding of calculus. Even though I have done all the material before, this course was a good refresher and is much better taught than any high school course I know of.","If you're not a math person, don't take a math class. You will need to work. Many people complain about this course because we learned the skills before we learn the formulas; this helps us better understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. If you want an easy plug and chug math class, take one of those \"Math Class for Humanities Concentrators\" or something. This course is great (but I love math, so...)","The three problem sets a week require a consistent commitment to the course throughout the week and force you to be committed, especially since homework grades account for 25% of your final grade.","My TF wasn't that great, so that made the course not as interesting as I had hoped. That said, I liked how the class was only taught in section; I don't think I would've been able to handle a lecture-only math class my first semester in college. There's a lot of psets, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it.","You may need it for many classes","Will give you a better understanding of the purpose of calculus as a whole.

I'm not sure how much of it I will use it again...but the head TF promised that most of it is useful.","If you really apply yourself on psets and learn the material to the best of your ability you will not find this class to be unmanageable. It is very organized and there are plenty of resources available if you ever need help.","You can do it. Just survive.","This class is hard but you learn a lot!","Save yourselves and don't take the course. Great TF, awful class.","Despite its three problem sets a week, you will end up loving this class in the end because of its unique approach to the course material and the skills you gain from it.","This was a great calculus class, and even if you have taken calculus before, you will not be bored with the content.","Take Calculus BC before taking this class","Eric is a GREAT Tf. He is really committed to the course and willing to help anyone who is struggling one-on-one. The material is hard, though, so it does require quite a bit of studying.","Get ready to start sleeping at Lamont.","This class is really well organized and well taught. I recommend you take it if you are interested in math or even if you just need to fulfill a math requirement. But be prepared to invest time in it, about 7 hours a week to complete the 3 problem sets, + any additional time you separate to go to OH. I couldn't have gotten by this course without having gone to OH or seeking help from my TF, don't try to do it all on your own,or let things that you don't understand accumulate because it can get to be a lot!","It is a lot of work, but the TFs are absolutely amazing and you will always have help if you want it. Also, everyone should make use of MQC and all the practice problems posted online before every test.","The class is extremely well organized and help is available if you actively seek it out. The concepts are a lot of fun and there is focus on real world applications.","It's a necessary class and if you go to MQC and put in the effort you should do well","If you're not sure where to start in math, you can't go wrong with 1b. It's a really smooth transition from AP Calculus AB to college calculus. It wasn't too hard, but I still learned a lot and at a perfect pace.","Math 1b goes really in-depth on its concepts. At times, its interesting. Most of the time, it's a pain to do three problem sets a week. I would recommend this for someone who wants to brush up on the foundational aspects of Calculus BC (meaning you've taken BC Calc before). Otherwise, if you've taken Calc AB, I would recommend taking Math 1b after Math 1a.","If you're considering this course, it's most likely because you need it and not for fun.  I found this class difficult, but as long as you're willing to put in the hours and go to the help sessions, you'll be fine.  Just hope you get a good TF as well.","This class is for someone who is interested in math for math's sake. It is still an introductory class, so it is not one that should be taken if the object is to learn specific applications.","This is a fantastic course for anyone who has taken AP AB calculus","Previous knowledge is assumed!","Beware! A lot of students have had upper level math in high school and take this to get an easy A. If you challenge yourself, then you may feel completely lost.","It is not that difficult, is manageable, and teaches you a lot.","If you don't need to take this course, you likely shouldn't, as it takes a lot of time and a lot of hard work. If you need to take it, don't be alarmed! The p-sets take a ton of time and they are endless, but it really is not particularly painful. The material that we learned was relevant enough to always retain my interest, and even if it doesn't and you're struggling, there are tons of resources available to help you succeed in the course. I found it very challenging but quite rewarding, and very relevant for my concentration (Econ). Try to get a MWF section, because it's hard to have two p-sets due at the same time on Tuesdays. And try to get Janet as your TF, or Nina if she does it again next semester, or Jameel.","Students who have taken calculus ab in high school should be well prepared to take this class, but I also recommend this class to students who took calculus bc since this course makes the concepts very clear and easy to understand.","This course is pretty easy. It's consistent; nothing is unexpected. 3 Psets a week and a few exams.","The p-sets are not terribly long and not awfully hard, and there are so many resources available.","It is a really great math class with a fantastic structure. The three units all relate to the real world and there is so much help available.","T","The MQC will become your best friend if you have difficulty with some of the problems. However, they're very helpful there and the course overall is very fair.","Very fair and well structured class","I loved Math 1b. I thought the course was well-paced, and the tests were designed to be very fair and tested us on exactly what we were taught. The material was challenging, but there were many resources available daily like the MQC and office hours to seek help. The review sessions and practice tests were extremely helpful.","GET JANET AS YOUR TF!","The class is taught every well. Everything is inquiry based, so there are not formulas to memorize.","Once you get to differential equations, you will marvel at the kind of uses you can put them to: such as physics, biology and ecology, to finance and other topics.","Ensure you have a strong background in basic calculus. The topics in the course are diverse and  related well to real-world applications. The course can be demanding at times but there is a large support structure behind the course to assist you.","Be prepared to learn individually.","This course is a lot of work, but, if you are willing to work hard, it is doable to succeed.","A lot depends on your section but I loved the material even though I didn't particularly gain much from section. Because of math 1b, I want to take much more math than I initially planned on.","Math 1b is set up like a typical math class - a small section that meets 2-3 times per week for 1-1.5 hours. I found it to be well taught and definitely feel as though I've augmented my knowledge of mathematics. I'm not incredibly passionate about mathematics, but I found this course to be enjoyable. Math 1b met and sometimes exceeded my original expectations.","Although I had taken AP BC Calc in high school, I took Math 1b again because I wasn't solid on the concepts covered in the BC portion of the class - really glad I made that decision. I was able to build up a strong foundation in this class through all of the resources offered, and I feel a lot more confident about taking 21a next semester. If you ever have questions on homework or concepts covered in class, go to office hours and MQC! I did almost all of my psets at MQC, and all of the CAs were awesome and willing to take the extra effort to help you fully understand the homework.","Take it if you have to. Not really what most would consider elective material.","It is a great class.  You learn a lot.  The class, for me, was great because I had an amazing TF.  Gabriel was awesome!  However, I did hear of individuals in other sections having difficult times with their TFs.  The class is a needed foundational class and is worth it.  It is difficult but rewarding.  The problem sets really help you learn the material.","A terrific course; for many students a lot of work, though.","Math 1b is a great course, and though I found it challenging at times, I have to say overall I enjoyed taking it. Looking back, I can see how much I've learned and I think it will be applicable in many areas of study. However, there are 3 problem sets a week, so it can be a bit time consuming. The TF's are really helpful, though, so going to office hours can really ease the work load!","Make sure you don't take this class with too many other difficult classes since the three psets a week take some time and the course material is not exactly easy to learn as well.","Differential equations are useful but I feel like some of the other topics were a lot of memorization and not particularly useful for my concentration or pre-med track.","This class is by no means easy. Most people have a misconception that because this class is an introductory calculus course, that it is easy. That, however, is inaccurate. Math 1b will truly tax students mentally, but this will only result in more reward at the end of the course.","It's a very challenging class, but it's well organized. All of the teaching fellows are accessible, helpful, and pleasant people. I rarely did assignments by myself, but I met great people. If you don't like math, you probably won't enjoy this class. If you think you like math, you might find that, in fact, you don't really (or at least, arean't interested in pursuing it further).","Be ready to work! There is a lot of material and the course's pace is unrelenting. If you're struggling though, there are a lot of resources to help and the TF's and CA's are always great and willing to help.","The course is not very difficult but requires a great deal of time especially to complete problem sets. Tests are fair and the course material is generally interesting. Ask questions in class and attend office hours it makes a huge difference.","A good course in mathematics for those with a thirst for knowledge.","I personally did not understand the material well, often I studied hard and did fine on practice exams only to do poorly on the actual exams. It is a lot of information for a few months. I wouldn't take this course if I didn't have to.","This class definitely depends on the TF you get as your section leader. I got really lucky with Gabriel Bujokas. He is an awesome teacher, the best I had this semester. He really cares about you and really wants you to do well.","If it's a requirement, it's a requirement.","Do the psets and practice tests","They make it harder than it needs to be, but they give you some great resources to get you through it.","Learned a lot, very well organized, TF was amazing","Not a super easy class, but a very fair one.","it can be hard but there are plenty of office hours for help and the mqc is an excellent resource","Make sure you shop your section leader. That makes all the difference.","Math 1b is a good math class to take. It covers calculus material extensively and its section-based format is quite helpful for learning.","This class is pretty difficult and is quite a bit of work, but it makes you think about integration in a different way and it is interesting to look at what you've accomplished when you're done!","This class is definitely challenging, but take advantage of office hours, they are very helpful!","It isn't the most demanding class but it does require some effort with 3 psets a week","This course is challenging but if you do the homework, you'll learn a lot and be completely prepared for exams.","This class is very difficult.","very, very, very, very difficult class having not been exposed to the material before. the pace of the class and the necessary depth of understanding is very difficult to keep up with without prior experience","psets due every class but its kind of nice, work spread out among the week","Wonderfully put together course, you will love it.","This is a good class for understanding general calculus principles.","This class is a great introductory level class. You'll learn a lot and generally enjoy it. Having three PSets a week is a bit harsh though.","Math1b is a very interesting class that allows students to understand the many applications of calculus to other fields of study. The teaching staff is highly supportive and very accessible for extra assistance outside of class,","Math 1b is an incredibly important class to take if you want to better understand the world around you! Integral Calculus, Series, and Differential Equations all complement each other to help give you an interesting perspective on the world. And in order to succeed in this class, you just have to put a regular amount of time into the class. I loved the class, and I'm pretty sure you will too!","This course is so enjoyable. The homework and lesson plans are very well thought out. It's obvious that the Teaching Fellows enjoy teaching, and so does Jameel.","Learned a lot, but lots of busy work.","it is a fairly difficult calc class","Take advantage of the stellar teaching staff and supportive department. The course is really well organized and the material on the website is extremely helpful and thorough.","It's a slightly difficult class but you need to put the time and effort in to do well in it.","Your TF can make this class into a living hell, as is my experience.  My advice is to switch out of your section and into another one as soon as your realize that s\/he does not make class material sensible.","Only take this if you have to and if you have a good TF.","You will learn a lot in this class. This class has a lot of problem sets, but on an average week it shouldn't take you too long to get them done. There are a lot of resources that will help you succeed in this class. My favorite would have to be the MQC(Math Question Center). You essentially go to a classroom and ask course assistants questions about your homework. You don't ever have to worry about getting super stuck because there is someone to help.","3 psets a week can be tough, but the amount of support you get is AWESOME! Also, Jameel is just super nice and approachable, and this is a course in which personal math momentum can be built since the TF's definitely encourage you to continue studying the field in the future! However, for those less math-inclined, this is not a plug-and-chug calc course. Be prepared to think conceptually.","This course is beautifully structured. Section for me was very helpful, as I had Jameel as my section teacher, and he taught the material very well. The PSETs are so useful and they actually teach things as you go through them, so the learning continues outside of section. The math department is really good with their office hour availability and there are always people to help.","I would only recommend this course to someone who is willing to put in the time and work necessary to learn the material and get a good grade.","Don't underestimate how challenging this course can be!","The resources to do well in this course are incredible. You will learn so much if you put in the time and effort!","A great class if you use the MQC to waste less time on homework, do all of the practice tests, and the wealth of resources they give you.","All the resources are available for you to succeed in this course, it is just a question of you staying on top of your work.","The class is awesome.  The way they teach math here is so different from any math class I've taken before.  Instead of just being told to memorize formulas, we actually learn the theory!! And worksheets, practice tests, TF notes, and review sessions were all so helpful in preparing for exams!  Everything is so organized!!","Great class. You have to do the work and genuinely understand the material to do well and that takes a lot of hours unless you have taken calculus before.","The material in this course is a bit tough but the TF's are very focused on making sure you understand the material.","If you're prepared to put in the time then this is a good class","The class is a lot of work but there are many ways to get help with comprehension.  MQC is a wonderful place to go and helps with the assignments in this class a lot!","This class is very fun! Infinitely better than Math 1A. If you are a freshman and debating between the two, go ahead and take 1B. Even if you struggle at the beginning, you can get help easily and will be able to catch up in no time. As a sophomore who took 1A last fall, I cannot stress enough how much better 1B is as a class. Make sure you take the course when Jameel or Janet are the course heads. They are phenomenal!","You learn a lot really quickly-- it's a good course, but quite a bit of work.","Don't be intimidated by the workload at the beginning of the year because things become much more manageable after the first unit is over.","This is a great class to help you transition from the computational style of work in high school to the conceptual style of work in college."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"8.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"253","response rate":"87.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 1b","course_id":"2833","cat_num":"1804","1s":"7","2s":"19","3s":"59","4s":"104","5s":"30"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 1b","course_id":"2833","cat_num":"1804","1s":"0","2s":"11","3s":"42","4s":"33","5s":"9"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 1b","course_id":"2833","cat_num":"1804","1s":"1","2s":"73","3s":"86","4s":"31","5s":"12"}},"success":true}
