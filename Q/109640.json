The readings are fantastic, the discussions are wonderful, and Mo is amazing.  I never knew that the 19th century was so interesting!","This is a good way to decide whether or not you would enjoy history and literature. However, you need to make sure that you are interested in the subject matter.","professor is a very hard grader","Unless you really love Britain and France, you will find this class boring.","If you're interesting in either the history or literature of France or England at this time, take this course.  If you're particularly interested in the intersection of history AND literature, sometimes the class deviates from this goal, but overall Mo is incredibly knowledgable about this subject, and is a great facilitator of conversation.  At the end of the day though, because the class is run in a discussion format, your experience is dependent on the other members of your seminar, so make sure you can stand sitting in a room listening to your peers ramble on and on for hours before taking this class.","A fascinating look at a fascinating piece of history through fascinating sources. The class is well-organized, intellectually stimulating, and had a great atmosphere of learning for learning's sake. ALSO, Mo is a fantastic professor. Even if you can't take this class, you should make sure to take another class with her.","This was definitely my favorite course this semester. There will be a lot of reading but it's not too difficult and it is definitely doable if you manage your time. Without a doubt, take this class, Mo is an amazing professor and will facilitate such enlightening discussions.","This is a great introduction to history and literature, and just a really fun course in general. Would highly recommend!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"13","response rate":"76.92","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90av","course_id":"10960","cat_num":"11227","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90av","course_id":"10960","cat_num":"11227","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST-LIT 90av","course_id":"10960","cat_num":"11227","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
