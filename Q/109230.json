She is a vibrant, charismatic teacher whose enthusiasm for her work (and for the work of her students) is contagious. The course material is fascinating to begin with, but working with Professor Georganteli was an experience I will treasure forever. What an incredible person, and an excellent teacher to boot. I learned much more than I ever have in a class of this size and scope, and came away more excited to be a student than ever. I couldn't have asked for a better semester in this class, and wish I could take it again and again.","Eurydice Georganteli is an excellent seminar leader. I highly recommend future students to take this course and really engross themselves in Crusading History in a meaningful, yet manageable manner.","This course was both challenging and accessible. I learned a lot about the Crusades by looking closely at objects and doing presentations on specialized subjects, which was a really effective way of broaching such a broad\/dense subject.","This is a very special and unique course.  I was extremely lucky to be able to take it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
