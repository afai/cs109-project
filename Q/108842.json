If you like to paint give it a whirl.","This class was very frustrating. I expected to paint for the 6 hours of class, but sometimes would paint for only 2--or none.  We spent lots of time doing other pointless things, and we never really learned anything.","The professor is wonderful!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Painting is actually really exhausting, I didn't anticipate how tired I would get after 6 hours.","This course is good for anyone interested in developing oil painting skills and specifically interested in the figure in art. You should be willing to come up with creative ideas but also stick to specific assignments. The small setting is great for interacting with the other students, don't forget to learn from them. The more time you put into working on your pieces and thinking about what you want to do, the better. There is no easy way out in the class, but if you work hard you will improve and learn from the class. Matt and Helen are both brilliant and very nice, but it can seem difficult to access what they are really thinking some of the time--expect to be proactive about reaching out to them and your classmates for help.","Great class if you want to expand pre-existing skills and talents in painting and drawing; terribly frustrating and life-consuming if you have never done either. By far the most frustrating and difficult class I've taken at Harvard. I just felt like I was trying my hardest for no real recognition or purpose, because nothing I produced compared to the others.","You get out of this class what you put in. I spent 3+ hours in the studio outside of class time to think about project ideas and work on assignments, and found the course incredibly rewarding and more than worth the time.","Please, take the time to take this class. The work is different from typical psets and essays. It is drawing, and painting. And that can be done to unwind, but also be pensive about the things you want to communicate in different form. The professor is great, and the class size is perfect to get to know students with other interests.","It's a VES class...you're going to be spending a lot of time (you will want to) in the studio. But it's SOOO worth it. Matt and Helen (TF) are WONDERFUL, and the people you'll be taking the class with (will most likely) be wonderful too :). You will grow as an artist and be equipped to try creative things and approach things uniquely for yourself.","TAKE IT. life changingly good. matt and helen are both wonderful and push you to find your own style by the end. it's magic."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.73","workload":"3.36","difficulty":"3.64","recommendation":"4.55","enrollment":"11","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 23","course_id":"5148","cat_num":"11317","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 23","course_id":"5148","cat_num":"11317","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 23","course_id":"5148","cat_num":"11317","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"2","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
