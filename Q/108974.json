She is interested in you if you go to office hours. She is difficult to understand in lecture. I couldn't always keep up with her. But this class will give you a new perspective on law and is also a great introduction to anything law-related.","If you are interested in any of the subject matter definitely take it!","Not an easy class, but very interesting and Professor Jasanoff is phenomenal.","It was one of my favorite courses of the semester. The topic is great.","This course covers very interesting subject material, but I believe spending an entire semester on it is a stretch.","This class is a very interesting idea in theory, and Prof. Jasanoff is fantastic. It was also a bit hard to follow the links between sections of the course (only tangentially related by their relationships to law or science) and the grading for the class was VERY erratic. Overall, I'm not sure, if I could go back in time, if i would definitely take this class again.","The material in this course is awesome and the workload is manageable. It's not an easy A, but the course covers some really interesting and relevant topics.","If the section component improves, this class is really worth taking. Even if it doesn't, the subject matter is really important for anyone who wants to go into law later on in the future.","The class material is truly engaging, eye opening, and informative. Be sure to dedicate as much time as you can to the readings, and to reflecting on the readings, to truly get the most out of this class.","Take this class. Getting to know professor Jassanoff and Shun Ling was one of the most rewarding relationships I've had with teachers so far at Harvard, and they do a wonderful job of brining in exciting speakers and making the material relevant.","Definitely take this class (or any others that are taught by Professor Jasanoff) if it is offered again! Amazing reading list, great lectures, and you get the chance to learn from one of the founders of the Science, Technology, and Society field! Took it as a pure elective and definitely found it worthwhile.","Professor Jasanoff is incredibly smart and talented, but is also very pedantic so there is not a lot of room for discourse\/dialogue. We cover a lot of material though and it's very interesting. Not very cohesive as a course overall but very engaging in separate units.","this course, while fascinating, is not easy. There are many readings, and there are many dense readings. The class forces you to think about law and science in a way that stretches your brain. Definitely one of the hardest classes I've taken here, but if you are interested in the material, well worth your time."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Take this class. It's hard. It's a lot of reading. The professor is kind of intimidating. But you get out of it what you put into it - which is A LOT. If you have any interest in the intersection between law and science, take it. This class is awesome and I enjoyed my experience. Definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.","This class challenges you to address current issues at the intersection of law, science, and society. It totally changes how you think about systems society has set up, and the fundamental conflicts between law and science. A really interesting learning experience, and not too tough!","Personally found the units hit-or-miss in terms of how interesting they were, but Prof. Jasanoff is a very compelling lecturer. The course is probably better suited for someone with a background in sociology\/pre-law rather than science\/engineering (the most relevant area is biology).","This class convinced me not to go to law school.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I enjoyed the material and think the individual cases we looked at are interesting. Just made me realize how deeply flawed the judicial system is. Professor Jasanoff is brilliant -go to her office hours!\r\nIf you're lucky, she will give you biscuits and make jokes about Downton Abbey and the Tardis.","EXCELLENT materials, and of course Prof. Jasanoff invented the field, so this is a class you'd want to take. I do highly recommend taking this course pass\/fail if you are NOT a science concentrator or pre-law (or maybe you are), because I had difficulty keeping up with the material once midterm season hit. As someone with almost no background in law, I learned an absurd amount about the (American) Justice System from this class, and realized that I definitely am not interested in law because the solutions I seek are not there. This course give you an excellent overview of relevant, modern matters in the courtroom, SCOTUS, but contextualized in what society is thinking, and what I, as a sociologist and just a citizen, think about things. It was a bit intimidating standing my ground against so many more informed pre-law and science concentrators, but I am VERY glad I took this course.\r\n\r\nFor those with heavy workloads, slow readers, or those with little knowledge of the judiciary, definitely do consider pass\/failing it.","This class is a great introduction to issues at the intersection of law, science and society, and it covers a huge range of material - even if one day's topic doesn't interest you, many others will. Prof. Jasanoff also asks for some biographical information from each student at the beginning of the course so that she can make sure to cover info that will fit students' interests. Though lecture was a bit slow at times, it was nice to just sit and learn from Prof. Jasanoff for 2 hours each week since she is so brilliant\/experienced in this field. Overall, this is a great option for someone particularly interested in law or science, or a sociology student who wants to diversify their electives. I was actually in the minority as a sociology concentrator but I loved that it was different from other soc classes I've taken and I felt that I could make unique contributions to discussions."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 180","course_id":"4683","cat_num":"38367","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 180","course_id":"4683","cat_num":"38367","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 180","course_id":"4683","cat_num":"38367","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
