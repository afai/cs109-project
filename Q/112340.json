Class does move fast and there is a significant amount of work involved but for the most part everything is geared towards improving language skills in Italian.","Awesome course, you have to take it! This course is definitely doable, the only thing is most of the class knew the basic grammar of one or more Romance Languages beforehand and the speed that we move through the material with requires that you know at least a little bit of grammar before coming in.","Its a lot of work, but if you already know a romance language and want to quickly get a functional reading knowledge of Italian and basic communication skills, its a good class.","This class is great if you want to get a feel for Italian in a very short amount of time, but it is pretty labor-intensive just in terms of workbook assignments every night.  That said, the amount of work assigned makes it pretty difficult not to become familiar with the grammar so it's beneficial even as it might feel annoying.  Also, in-class discussions are really fun because they end up being pretty comical and it's a really relaxed environment for just trying to absorb and get a feel for the language.","I can't imagine a better introduction, so long as one is motivated and has some resources to supplement class materials on one's own. It was fun, relatively painless (except for social awkwardness during some creative exercises), and a great start. From day one, the teacher is speaking Italian, and it is a thrill to be able to follow along, even imperfectly.","Although I cannot compare to a full year of Italian at Harvard, I cannot claim to possess after one semester the equivalent of a full year of Italian study.  You must keep up with the work and study on your own; if you want to get a lot out of the course, you must do this in addition to the copious homework material. All things considered, it's probably one of the better ways to learn Italian. Classes are enjoyable and, unlike many other courses, can give you the sense that you are learning in class and not simply at home."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class was by far my favorite of the semester.  The class progresses at a quick, but gradual pace so that I found my Italian skills growing immediately.","Take it! You'll learn basic Italian, and the process will be as fun as it sounds! People who want to learn Italian are generally very cool and fun-loving people, and you'll get to see them every day and form a little Italian family! Dalila won't be teaching it next year, which is sad, but if you commit to the class, you'll likely have a great experience no matter what. The details of the course aren't ideal (poorly conceived exams, lots of busy work homework, mediocre textbook) but this will not matter to you one iota when you eagerly get up every morning to attend the combination uproarious comedy spectacle and intensely satisfying learning experience that is Italian Acd. Take it, take it, take it. (Tip: It's basically like 1 class, 1.5 at most, if you already know Spanish or French well.)","Be prepared to put in the time","I took this class to fill 2 elective spaces in my senior spring. It was a lot of busy work, but not too difficult. Plus, I learned how to speak a new language! Pretty cool","SO GOOD! BEST CLASS IN THE WORLD","This is an excellent course for anyone who has the time to throw themselves into Italian. The book is excellent, and it is definitely as difficult as it is entertaining. We listed to at least one song every day, and our classes favorite phrase is \"come si dice\" or \"how do you say...\" We've learned so many useful words this way (ex. the Italian verb for flirt is flirtare!)","A lot of attention is paid to grammar, so that might be difficult for students who have grown up speaking another language and have not been exposed to learning grammar. The class is a great experience overall. Students in the class got close with each other. Also, your italian improves tremendously."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["It's a wonderful course but it requires a lot of work, so be prepared for that.","The workbook presents a lot of busy work (out of 4-5 hours a week on the workbook, only around 2 of those are valuable, you just kind of zombie through the other 3). That said, it does count for two classes, so the time it demands is appropriate to two classes. The teacher is great, she provides plenty of feedback and really tries to make everyone feel comfortable with the class- she helps out if someone is behind and is very approachable regarding questions and suggestions.","This class is useful only for a specific type of student. If you believe yourself to be that type of student who would really benefit from taking this class, then take it. If not, don't.","Take this class if you have a solid understanding of another romance language and really want to learn Italian. It is a lot of work and will occupy a lot of your time. Try as hard as you can to not save your homework until the last minute."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It's so much fun, but definitely a lot of work! The pace is super quick, so keep that in mind when signing up for this class. You do learn a ton of material in a short amount of time, but it can be hard to keep up with. Favorite memories were going to the North End twice instead of holding a regular section.","If your goal is speaking then this can be a very good course for you, esp. if Sarah Axelrod is the TF; if you're mainly focused on reading then you should probably take the \"Reading Italian\" course instead","This class is very intensive, do not be fooled. It moves very fast and does take a lot of work. I would have probably learned more if I had taken two semesters instead of Acd which combines Italian Aa and Ab into one semester. However, the class was so much fun and one of the highlights of my semester.","If you're willing to put the time into this class, you will be highly rewarded. This class was a joy to take from beginning to end, and a jewel of Harvard University."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I felt fluent by the end of the semester! Take this class; it's one of the best I've taken at Harvard. You have to be prepared to put in time and effort (it is intensive, after all), but it's not difficult. It feels great to learn a language in such a short period of time.","It will take a bit of time given that it compacts two semesters into one, but this course will have you speaking Italian in one semester, no joke! It's a lot of fun (if romance languages are your thing), and you can get one on one teaching given that the intensive classes are usually very small.","Interesting course; can be work intensive but overall, very fulfilling."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Don't be intimidated by the fact that the course is accelerated. There's a lot of work, but you'll get so much out of the course.","It really is two credits worth of work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.30","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ITAL Acd","course_id":"4417","cat_num":"3065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ITAL Acd","course_id":"4417","cat_num":"3065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ITAL Acd","course_id":"4417","cat_num":"3065","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
