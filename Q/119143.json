It provides an overview of modern international affairs that is useful for anyone studying this era.","The harder you're prepared to work, the more you should be prepared to benefit from this class.","This is one of the best classes I've taken as an undergraduate or graduate student.  The professors work very well as a team, but differ enough in their outlook and views to make it especially value-added for both, instead of just one, of them to teach the class.  The way they select participants also ensures that discussions are lively and well-informed.","do the reading.","They must really be willing to do the reading and be interested in the material.  It is a lot of work to do if you aren't interested in it.","There is a lot of reading so only if you are prepared for that. You will come away with a large amount of knowledge about international relations, empires and many questions which are not just relevant for history students but also those from other disciplines."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Charles Maier is in many respects the archetype of what a university professor should be. I mean that in the best possible fashion. He is almost unbelievably knowledgeable, in the way that only someone with a vacuum for a mind and incredibly broad interests can achieve after a lifetime of research. He brings this breadth (and depth) of knowledge to his teaching, along with an attitude that can only be described as genteel. Having him as a professor makes what might be an otherwise onerous reading load more palatable. This is one of those courses where you get out what you put in. If you have the time and energy to do all of the readings in detail, you will gain an enormous amount from it. Professor Ferguson was on leave, so I cannot comment on his teaching, but I imagine the course is at least as engaging when it is co-taught.","This course is amazing.  The class is taught very well and gives you access to great minds - both the professor and the graduate students.  There is quite a bit of discussion and the course requires a high level of critical analysis.  Nevertheless it is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Harvard and I thoroughly enjoyed it.","This is excellent - Maier is great. Make sure you do the reading.","Be prepared for some boring reading and class discussion but with a very knowledgeable professor.","Possibly the best course I have taken at Harvard. The reading load is immense, but the readings themselves are always worthwhile. The range of Prof Maier's learning is dizzying and he is an outstanding teacher. Unlike in many seminars, discussion was actually collaborative and engaging, rather than students talking at each other. Above all, the scope and variety of this course sets it apart from anything else offered in the social sciences.","The readings are a fundamental (and usually enjoyable) part to the course and one should be sure to have enough time for them as there is always a lot to read."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.43","workload":"2.86","difficulty":"3.57","recommendation":"4.43","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1964","course_id":"2459","cat_num":"7774","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1964","course_id":"2459","cat_num":"7774","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1964","course_id":"2459","cat_num":"7774","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
