It is interesting, hands-on, and the teaching staff really cares about your success.","Really fun and engaging alternative to traditional, lecture based physics.","AP50 will not make you feel pressured, but at times you'll wonder if you're wasting your time. Depending on who you are, you might be wasting your time. This class is neither difficult nor methodical, so I wouldn't recommend it as a way to really learn the basics of physics.","This is efinitely the way to go if you're considering physics 12 or 15. It is much less work and still counts as a calculus based physics course. The NB annotations can be tedious but the projects are generally pretty painless and psets are only due every couple of weeks. It can be a very rewarding physics course if you put some time and effort into it.","Dear Harvard students, you are fooling yourself if you think that you don't subscribe to the desire to achieve \"results\" in classes, even though you do not necessarily focus on the process by which you get there. This class will be unlike any class you've taken at Harvard, and it will, hopefully, shift the entire foundation upon which you've based your education. I truly believe everyone should take this course; prepare to take full ownership of your learning.","This is not a typical lecture type physics course. You work in teams and you take control of your own education so this class can be as easy or as challenging as you make it. If you put the work and time in you will come out with so much knowledge and experience and fun. I took physics 11a fall semester then I switched to AP50b spring semester and the difference between the two courses is that AP50b is very hands-on and makes you think for yourself. You don't spend your time solving tricky problems on paper but how to apply what you learn to physically make something. You aren't pressured to get the right answer but you are rewarded for creativity and effort. This class is amazing if you are looking for this type of teaching.","This is a really good class. It definitely went through some growing pains this year but it was still a great course and I am confident it will only get better in the future. The teaching staff is very passionate and helpful","TAKE IT. It is hands-down the best physics class ever.","The class felt like a show. Everything seemed to be about making the professor look good instead of really focusing on the physics. I was disappointed with how little I learned","I would take this class in one or two years, when all of the kinks have been worked out. Seriously worth a gander, truly a unique course at Harvard. Learn how to engage better with the concepts of science.","This is an interesting course because of the new way that it is taught!  Really recommend shopping it.","It was slightly frustrating to have a class where there are no lectures because you can never know what the Professors are expecting from you, especially when the book isn't that great and quite confusing. However, the RAA's were very low-stress, the psets were fair, and the projects were manageable.  Carolann was really awesome, and I think this is a much better substitute to Physics 11b or 12b or whatever they're calling it.","Be prepared to do the work and engage fully with your team. By doing so you will reap the rewards of learning for the sake of learning.","The group oriented nature of the class is extremely refreshing and useful. There is honestly no better physics class than one where you can learn from and teach your peers. Highly recommended! :)","This is a great course where the work load isn't painful even if it can be a lot. It overrides any painful high school physics experience you might've had.","TAKE THIS, it is a fun, interesting, and just great way to get rid of you Physics requirements.  It might not be as intense or go into full depth of the material that a regular physics class would cover...but this doesn't matter because this class still hits all the main points and its fun and interesting.  working with teammates > working individually.  projects>>tests","This class could be great, they are continuously improving it and I only see it getting better.","A very interactive approach to introductory physics","I really enjoyed this class as it provides a very different environment to learn physics. I am an engineer so I really liked how we applied physics principles to three separate physics projects. The class could be a bit more organized as grading was kind of confusing for p-sets and NB annotations. This class is based on learning from your peers so there is not a large lecture component but you mainly work on physics problems in a group setting. Overall a great physics class that will only improve in time, but definitely not the traditional approach to teaching physics.","It's much better than any other similar physics class, and the projects can be fun, albeit time-consuming. Overall, much easier, more fun, and more informative."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you want a truly revolutional learning experience, take this course!!! You will learn from your peers, learning from teaching your peers, and have a blast while doing it.","Take this class!","This class is a gameshow.  The professor appears periodically, usually flanked by important-seeming consultants\/educational professionals\/high school teachers\/university professors, to show off you, his guinea pigs, to his audience.  There are a bunch of questions whose answers don't matter for credit: it's more about going through the motions.  You will be asked to help with research on teaching methods.  You could easily get through this course without learning anything new, especially if you took any physics in high school.     \r\n\r\nYet, this class may be your best option for second semester physics, if you fall into any of the following categories: A) You have no time on your hands and need to fill a requirement (my situation); B) You hate learning physics (i.e. you hate exams), and much prefer working on things with your hands in teams; C) You do not care how much you learn about physics and just want the easiest way possible out of this semester.  Of the people taking this course, most were a mix of B and C types.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the projects are a lot of fun and you do learn about being a good teammate, which is a stated goal of the course.  So while you aren't learning much physics, you are learning other, less academic things.    Watch out for the psets though.  They have the most frustrating grading scheme I have ever seen in all my years of taking classes: they actually discourage you from working hard to get the answers right, as long as you write a whole lot explaining why you were wrong\/confused.","Be prepared to teach yourself physics. If you really put effort into learning it on your own, you can learn a lot. If not, you will not learn much. The projects and team aspect are great and teach you a lot of skills. You will learn more about working on a team than actual physics in this class.","Take 15b, you'll learn more and be challenged more","this course will not give you an extensive background in physics. there is pretty much all self directed learning, so if you are not good at teaching yourself, DONT take this class.","You're not learning physics, you're learning to please the graders.","AP 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nontraditional style might appeal to you, but I strongly urge you to not take this class.  The class takes a lot of time, as there is substantial work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mandatory readings, problem sets, and group project meetings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outside of the 6 hours per week of organized class time.  However, if your learning style does not perfectly match the textbook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, you then face the prospect of spending even more time trying to learn the material.  In the end, I felt that it was not worth it for me.","If you did not come from a strong science background, yet are still premed or in the STEM fields, this is a great way to take physics. It really allows you to learn the material, and tests how you grow.","This is a great class to take if you want a general background in physics for future classes.","This class is great at forcing you to apply what you already have learned, but is horrible at teaching you new information. The quality and difficulty of the physics you are learning is on the same level as high school physics (not even AP level). The class covers a very cursory review of E&M, the textbook extremely verbose, the tutorial very basic, the projects not very applicable, and the training and preparation for the students to start the projects unsatisfactory and insufficient. \r\n\r\nMuch of your time will be spent with frustration on writing up impossibly confusing and verbose problem sets, drilling and machining failed projects.\r\n\r\nThe staff does put in a lot of work to make this class work. However, the idea behind this class is perfect in concept, but not so perfect in the real world. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the class is great at forcing me to become better at working with others. It's more of an engineering class.","This course was fun and interesting, but only some of the time.  The projects were a great opportunity to work with a group and develop something from start to finish, but there were also many components of the class that seemed to be more of a nuisance than an asset, such as the estimation activities and certain experimental design activities.","AP50b was a great, unique class! I switched in from PS2 and I definitely recommend this course for those students who are hands-on learners. For me, it was a much more enjoyable experience to learn the physics and apply it through the projects in AP50 compared to doing numerous psets and exams in the PS2\/PS3 series. I became more confident in my ability to approach physics problems, even though I did a lot less textbook work than I would have done in a different physics course. The six hours of class a week is not that bad, and it is definitely a less stressful way to complete your physics requirement compared to other courses. Please shop the course and see if it is a good fit for you!","It's very easy, but just tedious. If you take the time to go through the motions you'll do fine, but if you actually want to learn something I would recommend looking elsewhere.","Only take this class if you like the idea of taking ownership of your own education, If you already know a lot of the material, you will be a great help to your team. If you do not, like most people, you have to actually want to learn it or else you will bring your team down. If you are trying to get by with as little work as possible you will but it will be a much less enjoyable experience for your teammates. The projects are very cool and fun. It is very nice to have the class contained to two meetings- no labs or sections or necessary OHs. If you like the people you are with you will love the team model- you learn a lot from your teammates! The teaching staff really wants you to succeed in the classroom model they have- it is very supportive.","This class will sound very appealing at first - but make sure you really think things through and understand what you're getting yourself into. Expectations are very unclear and it's hard to know what you're supposed to do. Problem sets are very hard and they make you painstakingly write out every step in great detail and write explanations for everything you do. That being said I really liked how this course gives you a chance to get to know other students and work together in small groups. I got to know other students really well which was a definite plus. Carolann is the saving grace of this course.","Make sure to go to office hours, Carolann is extremely supportive and will work with students in order to make sure they understand the concept before even tackling a problem. In addition, communication with your team is crucial, this is ultimately a class that revolves all around the team formations.","This class does have a bit of a high time requirement, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had more fun with these projects than any other classwork I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an awesome growth experience that requires effort but helps you better understand how you learn and how you work in a group setting. For that, it is an invaluable course.","If you are self-driven, you will learn Physics. Expect to take control of your learning.","unless you like to learn by reading the textbook, dont read the book.","If you took AP physics in high school, this class is more of a review than new material, but the projects were very fun.","If you don't mind sometimes feeling unprepared for projects due to no lectures, it is an awesome course. Not very hard. Don't feel as though I learned as much physics as I would have in the traditional Physics 15a.","\"The flipped classroom\" is only helpful up to an extent.  First of all there was waaaaay to much work in this course particularly in the beginning. Some weeks had 2 reading and annotations (4 hours each),  study for RAA (2 hours), pset (10 hours), and project work (6 hours).  This totals 26 hours outside the classroom and since no one can work that much on one class discourages us to do this work effectively.  The readings were good, but you have to give far more time to allow us to read the material.  The material has to be re-presented in lecture so that everyone is on the same page because we don't understand the material just from reading it.  Then an in-person question and answer session should take place so that we all know the material.  Completely doing away with lecture is a terrible idea.  Some is definitely necessary.  The amount of math was nothing compared to what should be involved in a physics course.  I don't think I used calculus once....  Don't dumb down the material for the students.  We need to learn it.  Psets were unhelpful.  The rubric was horrid.  I'm supposed to be doing problem and math on these psets and definitely not writing essays which the rubric makes you do.  This was probably my biggest pain point.  Psets should be like in every course -- graded on correctness and have the option to work together.  Provide evening office hours (like physics night) where students can work together with TFs and instructors around.    Class was way too large for style it was taught in.  More guidance during final projects necessary.","Great course, you'll need to be self disciplined","This is the best way to get a physics requirement done because it does not have really tough math-y problem sets or exams. Instead, it is project-based and team-based which I really enjoyed. However it is very self-directed in terms of reading and learning.","You have to put Extra efforts to further your knowledge in physics","Overall, AP50 was a positive experience because one of the professors, Carolann Koleci, was a saint and offered so much support and guidance throughout the year. It made the class feel personal and manageable. However, The head professor, Eric Mazur was only there when there were people coming to film the course, so it seemed like he didn't care about the development of the actual students taking the class. AP50 was awesome in the sense that you were never really stressed out about your grade, but it was very frustrating because it often felt like no one was learning physics and we were just set out to do a lot of busy work. If you need to know physics for the Mcat, save yourself and don't take this course. You'll get a good grade, but that's a tradeoff you'll have to make if you choose AP50 (good grade in exchange for a lack of fundamental understanding). \r\n\r\nI think there definitely needs to be a lecture component of the course. I understand that the whole point of ap50 is to move away from that model, but I think the current approach is too extreme- it is unreasonable to expect students to teach themselves a year of physics with no guidance from the professors or any real incentive to learn how to problem solve (ie. exam grades). Additionally, the grading system needs to be tweaked as it felt very arbitrary and unfair at times - for example, when 80% of the class got a 0 on a problem set...that didn't make sense to me and just made everyone angry. This course was a positive experience in many ways, but there needs to be a lot of improvements in order to ensure that students are actually learning to solve physics problems. That is the biggest critique. I don't think many students walked away with a better idea of how to solve standard physics problems. Most students relied on prior knowledge to get by. The course material was too advanced too quickly and therefore people didn't learn to do the simplest versions of problems.","Much better class than PS2\/PS3! Only take though if you are okay with doing team projects, as this is a major component of the course. Effort also counts a lot, which I loved.","You'll cram the projects and the pset questions are often asked poorly, but it's better than standard physics classes and you'll definitely remember more than people do in other classes.","Think very carefully about if you want to learn to do physics problems (take another class) or to understand concepts and learn about teamwork.","If you're considering to take this course, you must realize that it is very different from traditional courses. You must be willing to put in the time to learn for yourself in order to get a lot out of this course. If you fall behind on the readings, it'll be hard to maintain a desire to learn.","I found it to be a relatively rigorous introduction to physics, on par with the material covered in PS12, and ahead of PS2\/3 in rigour. \r\n\r\nYou should consider this course if you want to take a more hands on approach to learning as opposed to simply problem sets and exams. If you don't like hands on learning this course is not for you.","This is a great course, with a few kinks here and there (as with any new course). Carolann is a great professor, and I really hope she's around in the next AP50 iteration. If not, I'd hesitate taking this course, because she was such a huge part of making it run.","This course has a lot of potential but there are still a lot of kinks to iron out. It was often a lot of fun but also often very qfrustrating when you arent sure whats being asked of you.","This class can be rewarding if you put in the time and effort to do the work. The class is entirely self- and peer-taught, so it is helpful to have some physics background coming in; students who hadn't taken physics before seemed to have a hard time with the material and with doing all of the work, and the team can't necessarily each you everything. The projects definitely force you to understand what is going on and apply it to building something. That said, the projects are awesome and this class is definitely unique to any other physics classes available. It is very accessible to people who are not in necessarily concentrating in engineering or the hard sciences."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"69","response rate":"82.61","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APPHY 50b","course_id":"1148","cat_num":"92262","1s":"3","2s":"14","3s":"19","4s":"11","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APPHY 50b","course_id":"1148","cat_num":"92262","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"33","4s":"8","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APPHY 50b","course_id":"1148","cat_num":"92262","1s":"2","2s":"18","3s":"26","4s":"6","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
