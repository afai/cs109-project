'08":{"comments":["I feel like I left with a great grasp of hebrew grammar and I learned lots of vocabulary.  With Irit's positive, friendly approach, there is really no better way to learn Hebrew."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["The class wasn't always enjoyable. I enjoyed learning Hebrew and improving. But I didn't always want to be there and didn't always feel comfortable.","Don't expect to be babied in this class; the professor respects students and expects them to be up to the challenge of learning Hebrew like adults.  The pace is quick; a lot of ground is covered. Very few handouts.  Don't expect your spoken Hebrew to improve rapidly.  But your understanding of grammar will almost certainly improve.  All in all, an indispensable class for intermediate students who wish to continue to advanced modern Hebrew.","If you're interested in learning a lot about grammar, this is the class for you. If you're more interested in Hebrew literature it's not."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This is the best language class you'll ever take.  Even if you've already got a full course load, take Hebrew with Irit as a 5th or even 6th course.  It's really more like a fun extracurricular.  I always look forward to class ... and you'll be amazed at the end of the semester how much you've learned.","I would say Irit creates a wonderful teaching environment and that the class has a lot of fun. Hebrew is a wonderful language to study at Harvard.","The professor and tf are wonderful","Best way to wake up in the morning","Irit is unbelievably amazing -- take this course to continue learning Hebrew and enjoy all the great songs and movies.","An easy language to learn considering how relatively new it is. Highly recommend, Irit's awesome!","Best class at Harvard! A lot of fun! Great teacher!","This class is fabulous. I adore Irit and Mishy and the lectures are just so much fun. It doesn't feel like class at all!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Beginning level was great, but each semester gets better and better!","This is the the best class I've taken at Harvard, with absolutely the most fun, caring, and patient professors. Irit and Osnat have become more than just professors to me - they are mentors, friends, and almost family. They put 100% of their efforts towards the students and our wellbeing and progress.","It's a great course.  Be prepared to work (because there's a lot of it), but it's totally worth it.  And Irit is fantastic.","This class is awesome, particularly for anyone hoping to take a stress-free class and learn much about Hebrew and Israel.","The course is an excellent way to become better acquainted with the Hebrew language and Israeli culture.","This may be auxiliary to others but, to me, the most important thing about this course is that you become a part of a Hebrew-learning family that persists for the undergraduate years and beyond. To say that the professor and teaching fellow 'get to know' the students is a vast understatement of effort, enthusiasm, and knowledge that the faculty contribute to the course. Other professors should audit this class to understand what it means to know a student and invest in him or her in a lasting way.  Hebrew everyday was the most fun because I was learning with friends \/ family. \r\n\r\nConcretely, I am very happy that Irit is so flexible with deadlines. This being a class that meets everyday, there are sometimes inescapable commitments that arise, and I love that I am able to turn in work when it is convenient for me. I do not think that this detracts from the level of effort I put into the work. No student does homework in order to receive a grade (homework is ungraded) but we do homework because we respect our education and we respect Irit. \r\n\r\nI feel that I learned a lot of Hebrew this semester. It's impossible to remember everything, but the vast amount of material means that you will walk away with an amazing knowledge of Hebrew even if you just sit in class and absorb passively. \r\n\r\nI loved the introduction of slang this semester. To me, the most important thing about taking Hebrew is being able to speak in a relevant manner with people my age. I know this isn't the case for everyone, but I think the course is very well balanced between modern, traditional (texts), and artistic Hebrew."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class is incredible. Irit came to class every day with so much enthusiasm and passion for the subject and the topics we were discussing that everyone else looked forward to class too. She is an amazing person and I learned so much in this class- not only about the Hebrew language, but about Israeli culture and writing- that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.","Take this course!","Amazing class! So much fun to learn with Irit","This is a phenomenally fun course with incredibly dedicated and fun teaching staff; a great way to better understand the language. One small disclaimer: the majority of the work you're expected to produce in this class is written, and speaking is the hardest part of foreign language acquisition, so do not expect to improve much in your spoken Hebrew."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Irit and Osnat are caring, warm people who want you to have a good experience in the class. However, you may feel a bit disorganized unless you set some of your own structures for how you want to study the material.","Don't take as an easy fifth class, it will require work. That said, Irit is amazing and you are bound to dramatically improve your conversational skills.","Irit and Osnat are simply two of the most caring and dedicated professors I have ever had. This is so much more than just a language course. In addition to teaching the normal components of a typical language course - vocabulary, grammar and speaking skills - Irit incorporates aspects of Israeli music and literature, Jewish history and thought into her lectures, covering an astounding amount of ground in the course of a semester. It quickly became clear that this class was not just a group of students, but a community of curious people interested in developing their Hebrew language skills, deepening their understanding of Jewish heritage, and strengthening their connection with the state of Israel together. This one will stay with me through Harvard and beyond.","You learn a remarkable amount of Hebrew in this class, and the class itself is enjoyable and not too stressful. The teachers really work with you to make sure you succeed.","There is no class like Hebrew. What begins as a class becomes a family. Irit does an amazing job. In one year, you gain exposure to the grammar of the language in full. The environment emphasizes individual expression in Hebrew\u00e2\u20ac\u201deveryone is asked to speak often, but there is no cold calling or external pressure. I could not be happier with the course.","Morning class with Irit will increase your happiness a little bit each day, and at the end of the year you will realize that you were a happy person thanks to her.","excellent teacher, but the class requires a lot of independent work and regular revision. It takes a lot of time to keep up."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MOD-HEB 120b","course_id":"3837","cat_num":"2563","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MOD-HEB 120b","course_id":"3837","cat_num":"2563","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MOD-HEB 120b","course_id":"3837","cat_num":"2563","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
