It's a specific topic but very relevant in this time of rising issues in Asia. Professor Smith knows what he's talking about and it is a great course. Be prepared to write a lot of notes and process a lot of material but it's definitely worth it.","Because there's no section, you should really work to do the reading and study your notes shortly after each lecture. I fell into the temptation of not doing the reading during the weeks on electoral reform because Prof. Smith pretty much summarized everything in lecture. But the later weeks delve into more complicated and varied material, and the lectures can't cover everything you need to know.","If you are interested in understanding how the Japanese political system works, this is the class for you. If you like political theory, you will be disappointed.","This class is awesome if you want to learn more about contemporary Japan. It covers everything that you need to know about Japan and gives insight into many of the customs and current events surrounding the country.","This was a fantastic class.  The professor was great and the exams were fair.  However, the exams are a vast majority of your grade, so check the syllabus if you don't want your grade decided by a few hours of work.","This class is great except right before the midterm and final there is a TON of material to study.","If you are interested in Japanese politics\/Japan in general, take this class!  It's great and I learned so much!  The structure of the class is extremely organized, and the lectures incorporate information not only about Japanese politics but also about general approaches to comparative politics.  As for the exams, if you go to lecture and study your lecture notes, you will be fine!  Professor Smith is a great professor.  He knows his stuff, and he presents it in an organized and clear fashion.","Great class. Prof Smith is really cool and down to earth. This class feels like an elective but counts towards the gov concentration. You'll learn a lot about Japanese politics in the context of global politics.","Take this course if you want a lot of information about Japanese politics!","Even if you are not so interested in Japanese politics or government, you can get a sense of how you can use political scientific tool for analyzing politics. Learning foreign political system deepens my insights on US politics.","Make sure that you are interested in Government because this class really goes into depth on how the japanese government operates and the history of how the current government was formed.","Great overview of Japanese politics from an institutional stand point. Would highly recommend this course to people who are interested in getting an introduction to Japanese politics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"1.60","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"30","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1270","course_id":"2221","cat_num":"11288","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"9","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1270","course_id":"2221","cat_num":"11288","1s":"2","2s":"11","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1270","course_id":"2221","cat_num":"11288","1s":"10","2s":"10","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
