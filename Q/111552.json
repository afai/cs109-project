Little day to day work and incredibly interesting subject matter.  Not sure about how final grades will play out.","This is a good introduction to some of the major issues in the region. It's very general, so if you're interests are mostly in one particular issue area, there are probably courses out there that are more focused and in-depth. Also, you get out of this class what you put into it -- it's really up to you how many of the readings you do and on what level you engage with them.","Only take this course if you are genuinely interested in the region, as there is a lot of reading about everything. Most other students in the course have a specialist knowledge of at least one country in Asia, and facilitates discussion.","It's comprehensive if that's what you're looking for.","There were no surprises in this course - very straightforward. Workload is not bad at all, though you can get a ton more out of the course if you read everything. Very good professor. Nothing too difficult to understand.","It's a lot of reading and lectures are long.  That said, you will get the chance to interact with the professor in section (hopefully he continues to do this).  He is very caring and loves to keep you up-to-date as possible with links to news.","Lectures could be a bit dull but interaction with the professor is valuable","The course is mainly composed of undergraduates and is tailored to those who desire a basic introduction to international relations of East Asia.","Great course, would highly recommend unless you are scared of long papers.","I would not take this class unless you are profoundly interested and somewhat well-versed already in East Asian IR. It just didn't feel like a class for people who were new to the study of east Asian relations.","I came in knowing extremely little about international relations, as a transfer student from a business program. I came away  learning a lot. The amount you get out of this course is a function of the amount of effort you put in. The course is incredibly valuable if you are willing to put in the time. It is also cutting-edge in that the literature on international relations theory as applied to the East Asian context is not very extensive, allowing students to be impactful thinkers about the direction of East Asian IR. Professor Johnston is a great teacher and among the nicest, most approachable professors you will find on Harvard's or any other campus.","Best course to boost interest and deepen our knowledge about IR in East Asia","If you're interested in IR theory or East Asia anything, this is a great class!","Professor Johnston is one of the most honestly good people I've met at Harvard.","If you are deeply interested in international relations and\/or East Asia, this is a great class to take. If you are not, then it might not be the best for you.","This class is excellent if you want to learn something, perhaps a lot of things.  At least it was for me.","Prof. Johnston provides a course that covers interesting subject matters and leads some of the most engaging sections I have ever attended.","This is what we wish all Harvard classes could be like.  An interesting and comprehensive introduction to the IR of East Asia, and very well taught.","This class is quite boring. Most people tend to drink a lot of caffeine before the class or they purchase caffeinated drinks during the break. It is good only if you are immensely interested in East Asia."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is a very mixed course. Professor Johnston is terrific in many ways - approachable, interesting, and extremely knowledgable. His insights are incredible. The reading list is very heavy and much of it is dense. However, it seems you don't need to know more than just the abstract and conclusion. The section component is weak - just summarizing the readings. It can be a manageable course with midterm\/final similar to Gov 20 (IDs, short essay)(50%) or final paper(50%) or both (25% each).","Professor Johnston is extremely knowledgeable and its evident that he knows everything there is to know about East Asia. The workload is not too heavy, but you absolutely must keep up with the weekly readings in order to understand what is going on in lecture and in section. As long as you make a solid effort to understand the concepts and apply them accurately in your work, you will learn a lot and do well!","Professor Johnston is a very clear and effective lecturer, and the fact that the lectures were put online was really helpful for keeping up with the amount of information contained in each lecture. The course also has a good mix of IR theory as well as commentary on how East Asia IR fits those theories. Also, Peter brings cookies to every section!","Take this course! IR of East Asia is the best class I have taken so far at Harvard. Prof. Johnston is just a legend in this field and at the same time very interesting to listen to and to watch presenting. Peter is the best TF you could ever hope for - he is frighteningly knowledgeable and with a great sense of humor! Just take it! Don't be scared by the reading - it's doable and section makes sure you understand it.","Much more theory than international relations of east Asia","I would recommend this course if you either have a solid understanding of international relations theory or a solid understanding of East Asian politics and history. For me, learning both areas at the same time was very challenging and made it one of the most difficult gov classes I have taken.","This course covers some of the most interesting and significant issues in East Asians international relations. I came with a lot of interest in the region but no previous coursework in IR, so it was cool seeing the issues from an IR lens. While some of the readings are a bit dense, Professor Johnston's lectures are really easy to follow and he's also easy to approach with questions. Expectations for the assignments are not that clear, however, and turn out to be a little higher than I would have thought..I only learned that after the first paper.","Good class. Interesting IR perspectives on conflict and cooperation within East Asia. Helps to explain the dynamics of the US-China relations","I would recommend Gov. 1760 to anyone with an interest in East Asia.","It's a good class, but it covers a lot of material.  Be on top of the readings and be able to really pick them apart for section.  It's a pretty rigorous class in that sense, and also a lot of competing theories that you need to know pretty cold.","Anyone interested in East Asia or IR  should take this course!!!! Started the semester knowing nothing and ended the course with a great understanding of foreign policy in the region of East Asia","Take this class if you're interested in the subject.","This course was a great introduction to International relations theory.  East Asia is the case study for everything, so make sure you are actually interested in the region.  Either way it is still interesting to look at all the competing IR theories and how they have played out in East Asia and predictions for the future.   Though sometimes the readings were a bit dry, overall the theory and lecture were engaging.","This is a great class that surveys the general state of relations between various East Asian countries. We first learned about the 3 IR theories and then looked at various areas and hotspots in the region (security, economics, Taiwan, DPRK, South China Sea, etc...). The readings are standard length for a Gov class, the exams are fair and the lectures are very interesting. Prof. Johnston is one of the world's foremost experts in the field even though he is too modest to ever admit it, so definitively do not pass up the chance to learn from one of the top Asia experts and get a better understanding of where the region is headed in the 21st century. As a side note, the class places a big emphasis on theory, hypothesis generation, IV and DV etc., so having taken a junior tutorial beforehand will give you a big leg-up for the midterm and final.","Really enjoyed this class. I thought it was very well taught and was a wonderful introduction to IR regarding East Asia.","Professor Johnson is fun, wants to talk to students, and gives good lectures.  His course is a theory heavy, hard class, You learn ton of composing viewpoints, but the \"on the ground\" things you learn tend to get muddied by broader trends in EA IR dynamics","Challenging, but rewarding class!","This class is wonderful whether you're a freshman with no international relations background or a senior specifically studying East Asian IR. It's not incredibly difficult, but it is really engaging class for anyone with even a passing interest in East Asia and\/or IR.","the class itself was pretty interesting but there is a lot of extra work in section not on the syllabus","This course is what a Harvard course should be--a look at relevant subject matter with the people leading the field. Prof. Johnston knows East Asia extraordinarily well, and I left the class feeling like I had a solid understanding of the region. What made this class really stand out was the outstanding TF, Peter Volberding--if he's still TFing, you might just want to take this course to see how good section can really be.","This is one of those classes I didn't really enjoy throughout, but towards the end, I began to realize how much I had learned. It would have been much more enjoyable with some IR theory background. Without it, I often felt lost as to the purpose\/theoretical significance of the items I was studying. \r\n\r\nI will say, however, that the teaching staff is really, really caring and very invested in helping you learn the material. I have full confidence that the course will improve.","A must-take course for anyone interested in East Asia. This course covers a wide variety of topics, illustrating different reasons for cooperation and conflict in East Asia. Do the readings and go to class and you'll learn a LOT.","Great class with interesting material but not an easy one.","This is a great class that provides students with a comprehensive theoretical and empirical toolkit for analyzing East Asian international relations. Professor Johnston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lectures were very informative, and Peter was a fantastic section leader. I would highly recommend this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"44","response rate":"95.45","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1760","course_id":"2239","cat_num":"2733","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"16","5s":"21"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1760","course_id":"2239","cat_num":"2733","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"22","4s":"14","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1760","course_id":"2239","cat_num":"2733","1s":"5","2s":"20","3s":"15","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
