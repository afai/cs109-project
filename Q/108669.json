You do some really interesting labs and will learn a lot about conducting research in general. The lab write-ups are not at all onerous and provide a great way to develop science writing skills. Dr Reynard is also a fantastic teacher","The lab reports can be time-consuming if put off to the last minute. Also, the labs are graded pretty harshly. I have no idea what my grade will be because the labs are graded tough with the promise of a curve. A mid-semester grading sheet with relative grades (A,B,etc.) would have been really nice to gauge my performance.","The labs were all pretty interesting and relevant to both day to day life and human evolution: you'll have the opportunity to learn about how certain genes or traits were selected for in ancestral human populations, and then see how that applies to you.  Experiments that let students learn more about themselves included caffeine metabolism, starch digestion, and how diet affects your molecular make up.  The basics of many different lab techniques were introduced, and doing a lab report for the majority of them definitely led to improvement in the level of analysis and details that everyone was able to provide for each lab.  The fact that any teaching or instructions Linda had to provide for a given experiment could be done in the same time frame as the lab, saving lecture hours during the week, was a really nice touch.  Felt like it kept things more efficient.  This is overall a great class to learn more about lab based research.","This is a pretty good class. There's not much homework, just one lab report a week. It's not very exciting in the beginning but the final experiments and guest speakers were more interesting. Linda is very helpful in experimental procedures and data analysis.","It's a really fun class where you'll learn a lot. Dr. Reynard is awesome and really helpful.","This is a great way to learn about a variety of lab methods in HEB prior to writing a senior thesis or otherwise doing laboratory research in the life sciences.","absolutely take this course. very practical and incredibly interesting."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is a great reintroduction to lab work; the labs aren't at all arduous but always interesting, and the final paper is completely open ended. Linda's a great teacher and this class was a lot of fun.","The grading is very ambiguous, so you don't really know where you stand the entire semester. Also, I'd recommend already being comfortable in a lab, because it can be really stressful.","This class is great for those considering writing a lab based thesis (in HEB or other fields) or generally pursuing a career in lab based research. It will take you beyond simply following the step by step instructions in labs in LS1a, LS1b, and PS1 and answering a few required questions. You will become more comfortable working in a lab and think more seriously about how scientific ideas may be tested. If you are someone who likes highly structured classes, this may not be the best for you. The small class size and individualized attention are awesome!","One of the better classes I've taken at Harvard and a great option for the junior research class.","This course is an awesome introduction to an array of biological experiments that can be used to ask a variety of questions. It's really great!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1419","course_id":"2736","cat_num":"98922","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEB 1419","course_id":"2736","cat_num":"98922","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1419","course_id":"2736","cat_num":"98922","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
