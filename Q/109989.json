The briefs are aimed primarily at improving students' ability to describe these developments concisely, so if you are looking to go into an academic or non-academic career field related to the region, the course is a good option in either case. Moreover, the inclusion of guest lecturers is very effective for refining one's understanding of specific policy issues. However, if you are searching for a more traditional academic course with a final term paper, this may not be the most appropriate option."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.70","difficulty":"3.80","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 2151","course_id":"10900","cat_num":"17965","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 2151","course_id":"10900","cat_num":"17965","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"8","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 2151","course_id":"10900","cat_num":"17965","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"5","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
