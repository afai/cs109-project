For me, it was a continuation of my exploration of my identity, and it has continued to teach me how to live. It goes beyond course material, it is really about choosing to be conscious and nurturing that consciousness in order to create more love in this society. This class is crucial at Harvard. It has made my experience here at Harvard much more meaningful and I will take the teachings with me in my future pursuits. This was a truly beautiful and necessary course for me.","Latin@s Remaking America is a unique course for several reasons. For one, it explicitly addresses Latinx issues, which is a rarity here.  For another, it includes incredible guest speakers whom you get to know much more closely than in other classes.  The course load is moderate, the readings are informative & relevant, and the is a lot of effort put into encompassing as much of the varied Latinx experiences as possible. Definitely a class worth checking out!","TAKE THIS CLASS. It is by far my favorite class so far and it will truly push you to think about matters important to you as a person and America as a society- the new America.","TAKE THIS CLASS!! It was wonderful, I loved the material. It's really the only class on campus that deals with contemporary issues Latino\/as face in America- and around the world. It's the closest to Latin American Studies Harvard has- which is sad. However, this class was great and more classes like these are needed at Harvard!!!","Finally a class about Latinos at Harvard. If you are Latino, please take it. It is a wonderful way to study and feel together as a community.\r\n\r\nIf you are not Latino, do not go into this class thinking you can study an entire people as animals. Exotifying and ignorant comments were thrown around, and they are not appreciated.","Take the time to really engage with the papers! They're fairly straightforward, but these assignments are usually more enjoyable than most I've had this semester in other courses, and are definitely very relatable if you are a Latinx student. Take time to get to know the professors as well; they are great lecturers and just fascinating people when it comes down to it. And definitely do the readings! They provide a lot of different perspectives that lectures supplement.","At the core of this class is teaching students about the role of Latinx in America. One of the coolest things about this class is that the professors arrange events with important figures, who put on great lectures and demonstrations.","Cool intro to Latin@ studies.","TAKE THIS CLASS! The essays were a great place where I could finally share my personal stories. There are not many classes at Harvard that tackle the Latin@ identity and I truly believe it is a topic that helped me grow. WE NEED LATIN@ STUDIES! Obed is also an amazing TF.","On the first day of class, Professor Carrasco boldly stated that this course was going to be a \"life-changing experience.\" 'Latinos' truly was life-changing (or at least perspective-altering and thought-provoking). This class was an amazing experience for me, both inside and outside of the lecture hall. Professor Carrasco and Professor Parra are extremely knowledgable and engaging scholars who really know how to motivate students and facilitate the learning process. Also, you'll have the opportunity to listen to the foremost scholar and thinker on ancient Mexico, Professor Carrasco. Professor Parra, who is from Mexico City, is also a great resource, especially when it comes to discussions about language and linguistics. You should DEFINITELY take this class if it is offered again. Plus, I swear we had mole and tamales at least 3 times during review\/study sessions. Take this class if you want to really immerse yourself in the Latino experience (music, culture, food, dance, performance, etc). It will surely be worthwhile.","It is the only course of its kind at Harvard, given that (shamefully) there's no Latino Studies degree or department here. Definitely worth taking.","Take it. Seriously.  Profe Parra and Carrasco, (affectionately Parrasco) sincerely care about the students and engage with them through so many great ways.  Take it.","This course, for a new course, was good. It needs to be organized better, and perhaps the mandate it takes on is too large- but it is a really important course, and tries to fill an important gap in Harvard's course offerings.","The course was a bit unorganized however this is common for any course that is taught for the first time. Also, many times it felt like the material covered in class covered a broad spectrum of topics and it would have been nice to focus on a select few. However, I understand that this class is one of the very few course that engages in this critical dialogue given the fact that the college lacks a Latino Studies area of study. The professors made a tremendous effort in providing students with the best academic experience given such limitations.","To really engage with the readings rather than simply reading over them. It helps so much with understanding and adding to the course.","This is a great introductory course for students interested in studying U.S. Latino experiences, as most other classes tend to focus on Latin Americans solely.","I enjoyed this class, and it was clear that the teaching staff was committed to making the students enjoy the class. The readings were great. The guest lecturers were extremely interesting. I enjoyed almost every part of this course. I think that this course will be really great next time it is taught (my uncertainty during the semester definitely came from the fact that it was the first time that this course was given).","TAKE THIS COURSE. We need more courses like this at Harvard! Interesting, lowkey, important, and they'll have parties with TAMALES\/TACOS!","I highly recommend this class! It was a bit disorganized its first year, but if those logistics get worked out, I would recommend without any reservations."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"33","response rate":"87.88","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1648","course_id":"10652","cat_num":"90682","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"7","5s":"22"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1648","course_id":"10652","cat_num":"90682","1s":"4","2s":"10","3s":"14","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1648","course_id":"10652","cat_num":"90682","1s":"10","2s":"14","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
