Anyone interested in understanding governments, or just interested in politics, should definitely take this course, and will be given a new insight into many aspects of democracy which are actually more complex than they may seem on the surface, such as voting or collective action -- in particular in light of the \"Occupy\" protests this year.","Great E&M class. Not a lot of work at all and the material is interesting. Harmless class to fulfill a gen ed and gov elective.","There's not really any math but it's interesting","Only read Analyzing Politics for this class.  Attempt the hard problems on the problem sets since the homework is pass\/fail.  Take good notes; you'll need them for the open-book tests.","Not a very interesting topic, but great for fulling E&M Reasoning without having to do any actual math. Great for Gov concentrators","Very little math","Very relaxing.","Confusing material","The lectures are interesting and Professor Shepsle is an entertaining lecturer. If you do the readings in the course, you will do well.","It is very interesting and accommodating to your schedule.","This course is a painless--actually enjoyable--way to satisfy the E and M requirement. Great course!","Definitely get the book and read it as you move along in the class, it's a good supplement.","This class is very fun, informative, and not very difficult.","The workload is pretty manageable, though beware the final paper at the end of the term. A freeform 3000 words during Finals Period is not something everyone wants to stomach.","This course is not an enormous time commitment but does not provide the rigor of many other classes. Substantial elements of this course overlap with Economics 10.","This is a great class if you are interested in government, and are looking for a breather in your class schedule. That being said, many may find it boring\/challenging if they find no interest in the subject matter. The weekly work is minimal and is all pretty easy to understand (unless you have trouble with VERY basic math\/stat).","Take this course if you would like to fulfill the math requirement without number crunching.","Best way to satisfy the math gen-ed for those who aren't looking to take multivariable and have any interest whatsoever in politics.","This class is a great way to fill a Gen Ed.  It's really relaxed, requires very little work, and is genuinely interesting.  Read the book though, as it elucidates a lot of the ideas from lecture.","Very interesting and applicable course. Decent amount of work, none of which was too hard though","It's a math gen-ed! and very little math is required... practically none.","It's a relatively laxed class, but it is by no means work-free.  It's actually pretty interesting and it makes studying for the finals and writing your final paper so much easier.","That this class is fairly interesting while not requiring much work of you. Just the 4 graded things. The only thing is it can be very dull and boring and if it's not a topic you actually want to know about there's no point","This is a great course for non-math people, the math is very minimal. There are only 2 Psets for the semester and are more about logic than math.","very dry but fairly easy"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["It's definitely an easy class, but the subject material is pretty interesting and worth thinking about.","Not a bad class and definitely something to look at if you're not trying to work too hard, but it can definitely get a bit boring and dry and you don't feel like you're learning much.","Take this course!!! Very interesting and different from a boring gen ed. I originally took this course to fulfill my math requirement for gen eds, but I ended up loving the course. Professor Shelpse has a great grasp on this subject and knows how to apply to to our lives. The workload is very light and when assigned a pset or an essay they are more often then not a pleasure to work on.","Great class, really interesting","Shepsle is a good guy and funny as well.  There is not much math in this class, and lectures can get pretty boring.  Experiments during section were definitely the most fun and engaging part of the class","I would tell them that this is a course that could very well spark their interest in political science and that they should take it as it both covers a gen-ed and is very informative and well run.","Great course. Dives deep into political philosophy within the US. Puts a bit of a negative view of politicians. Highly recommend if you are interested in how bias can affect legal decisions.","This is a straightforward, informative, and relevant EMR course for non-math people. It's a great way to fulfill the requirement if you are interested in politics or policy. Great textbook.","This class if politics for math people.","Good way to meet math requirement without ever having to actually do math. Shepsle is a great professor, and all the TFs are awesome! The material can be somewhat dull at times depending on your interests, but the people running this course really do make it fun.","A gen ed that takes itself too seriously. There are easier ways to fulfill the EMR requirement than this one.","Great! Easy Class! It is an amazing class to take to fulfill your GenEd Math requirement if you do not particularly care for math. It's only based on 4 criteria, so it does not require much work. Just make sure to complete all of the assignments.","This is a great class if you're looking for something interesting with a very light workload. The professor and TF's are great.","This is an extremely easy but interesting course. You will need almost no knowledge of math.","Good class that covers a lot of basic polisci and economic principles in a more engaging and interesting way than large lecture classes like ec 10. Nice way to fulfill your EMR requirement without taking something stupid like the magic of numbers or something really work-intensive like Math 21a.","This is a great class for those that are not mathematically inclined, but are interested in current events and institutions the politics behind them.","This class is a great way for Gov concentrators to satisfy their EMR requirement. The math involved is simple, there are very few p-sets, and the information you learn is very relevant to other aspects of political science thought.","It was a ridiculously easy class that required virtually no work \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which is not a bad thing, really. It just became tedious by the end, and the 70% weight applied to the midterm and final made it difficult to know what would be important.","I never thought the day would come when I would mark a Harvard class as \"very easy.\" Lectures directly mimic the readings, final exam OR paper, exams are open-notes, sections are not even every week.  I could go on.  A place to easily get a requirement out of the way (the topic is pretty interesting).  However, not a place for people seeking to get a lot more than an intro econ or any other gov class.","I absolutely loved this class!  Professor Shepsle is amazing and hilarious and made the lectures really entertaining.  This course really gives you an different perspective on politics, and you will never look at it the same way ever again.  The workload is light, so if you are looking for a fun elective this is a great choice.","I took this class first semester of my freshman year and it was my favorite! I learned so much and all of it was extremely interesting.","If mathematics isn't your strong suit, and you especially have an interest in politics, this is the perfect EMR gen ed for you!","The material is very interesting, the professor and TFs are excellent people and communicators, and the experiments in section are really fun and engaging. Definitely take this course if you're interested in political science.","For those who do not want to take an actual math class for their EMR requirement this is a great option because it includes very little math but it still a very compelling subject that can stand up by itself.","If you're not interested in game theory (which you'll \"learn\" about for like, 1\/3 of the course) and spatial models, no matter how much you think you like studying government and the more interesting subject matter (i.e. bureaucracies, legislatures, the courts)that comes towards the end of the course -- that is, once you're already sick of it --, the course will not be enjoyable for you. I took it thinking it would bring a practical, logical approach to politics, but instead the course introduced enough theories and models to make my head spin and not really learn anything other than that people are bad at making decisions and that one vote really does not matter (right before elections, too!). Would not recommend this course; if you're a Gov concentrator taking it as an EMR class, just go on and take Gov 50 instead."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.77","workload":"1.40","difficulty":"2.37","recommendation":"3.83","enrollment":"35","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"E&M-REASON 13","course_id":"1970","cat_num":"3544","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"18","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"E&M-REASON 13","course_id":"1970","cat_num":"3544","1s":"7","2s":"13","3s":"11","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"E&M-REASON 13","course_id":"1970","cat_num":"3544","1s":"24","2s":"10","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
