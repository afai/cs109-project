While I was skeptical at first about learning to brainstorm and problem solve, the tactics I learned in ES139 really helped me develop better habits and approach problems in general differently.","One of the two best classes I've taken here. Very interesting but little workload. One of the only classes offered with a practical application.","Its a fun class, with great teachers and you learn a lot of really practical information.  The workload is very manageable.  I would definitely take it if you have room in your schedule and are looking for an interesting class that won't kill you.","Great class for thinking. I looked forward to it every Tuesday and Thursday.","Reasons to take this class:\r\n1) It's not too much work\r\n2) It's interesting\r\n3) It's a fun way to learn about how innovations occur and are taken from lab to reality","You learn a lot about the innovative process and it is not very difficult.","Beware of the group project. Hope to God that your team members aren't slackers. Otherwise, a very nice course. Extremely reasonable work hours."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["can be interesting, the final project is fun, lectures are worthless,","You learn relevant and useful information about leadership, entrepreneurship, and innovation that you'll realize you can apply to the rest of your life. The coursework is very light. You get virtually no feedback about how you are doing in the course throughout the semester, though.","Great course for balance, however the grading process is not very straightforward.","Easy elective.","It's great for exploring creative habits and having a fun class with good readings that you find relevant and immediately applicable to your own lives. Rather poorly organized though, but it changes every year. Approach it without high expectations and you'll have a lot of fun.","This class is a really excellent elective for a semester when you need an easy class. There are no exams, no papers, just a short response due every class and a big group project at the end. As long as you keep up with your group once a week, this class should be a breeze and there are some pretty cool guest speakers too.","It's definitely interesting material, and Professor Weitz is great, along with some other guest lecturers, but the class is very disorganized and grading is ambiguous.","Loved it.","Not much work.  Lectures can be boring at times.","The class is full of seniors for a reason","This class can be hit or miss. However, I quite enjoyed the course, and it was the first class at Harvard where I actually did 90% of the reading, because it was interesting (and I'm a senior). You will get out of this class what you put into it.","do it. can be as interactive or as laid back as you want it to be.","Put a lot of effort into the final project and meeting with your team, because you'll actually enjoy working with them and working as a team if you put in the effort to really brainstorm when the time comes. coming up with these ideas and just throwing out different thoughts is really fun","This class offers students the chance to learn more about innovative design thinking! I'd recommend it to those interested in working in startups.","Good class with low workload overall but you still get something out of it.","It's an interesting class, but it get's kind of stupid towards the end due to repetition. It's also hard to find out your grade.","DONT be deceived by the cool concept of this course like I was. I KNOW it sounds great, but trust me that this course would be better suited as a short workshop and that you will get so, incredibly bored a few weeks into the course. Half the kids don't go to lecture, there is absolutely no feedback along the way (it is December and I have still not received a single grade in the course). The group project component is cool, but just doesn't warrant a whole semester. It's easy though, so if you're looking for a low time commitment then you got it!","Take this class, great topic material and manageable workload.","This is a saddening course. Saddening because it has so much potential. The material is interesting, the course has great industry connections, and a solid reading list. Yet it is a disorganized string of loosely related topics. All the assignments are ill-defined, with unclear expectations and goals. I received zero feedback in this course. All in all, it was a frustrating semester in which I kept wondering why I was there, and getting aggravated over the disfunction of the class. That being said, this was an \"easy\" class, in that what little work they assigned often did not take long. So if you're looking for an easy class, and don't care about whether you'll remember any big take-aways from this class 10 years from now, maybe this is for you.","very straightforward class. definitely possible to take as a 5th. at the end of the day, i feel like i got a lot out of the class. the project they had us do was very interesting. i wish there had been more direction\/feedback along the way (the course structure felt somewhat disorganized at times). also, there were times when the course felt somewhat repetitive, but this also help reinforce concepts in my head. the case studies were my favorite -- some of the other readings were dry.","This is not a typical Harvard academic class. It is a quite different style, and you get as much out as you put in. Going through a lot of the exercises in class, although the seem routine, can offer a new perspective on how you see creativity and innovation. Do all the readings and show up to class.","This class is not difficult at all - even as a 5th class. There are a lot of interesting things you can learn and take from this class, but if you only want to take it because you heard it's \"easy\" then you won't get anything out of it because you will end up on your laptop the entire time or not coming to lecture. You get out of the class what you put into the class. The group projects require time outside of class and scheduling times with your group members, which could take significant time as presentations approach.","Cool class if you're interested in entrepreneurship and science, and if you like innovation. Light workload and fun team projects.","It's a really fun class where you really get to connect with a group of people in order to solve a problem of your choice.  The only drawback of this class is that you receive no feedback during the entire class, so you have no idea how your final project is going to be judged.","This class is not about innovation in science and only somewhat about engineering; rather, the focus is mostly on commercializing ideas and business practices.  This is probably good for Harvard's endowment, but often feels like a softball consulting best-practices business course instead of a critical evaluation of the way we (can and should) innovate in science and technology.","Take ES 139 and be an entrepreneur in a think-tank for a semester.  There are limited assignments and the focus is really on developing an idea in a group format.","This is one of the courses that have so much potential. It could have been that course that changes your life forever with its unique practical approach to creativity.  However, it failed miserably. The course was rather disorganized, the lectures were plain and boring, and the final projects were mostly fluffy and could be done in 2 days. Unless they change the structure of the course significantly and are more creative about assignments and lectures, don't expect that you'll be changed much by this course.","The concept of the class is really amazing! To teach innovation and the process of innovation to undergraduate is very relevant. Many engineers, scientists, and students in the social sciences would highly benefit from this kind of class. However, I am not sure the purpose of the class is fulfilled with the way it is currently designed.\r\n\r\nAssignments are not really enforced (for example the innovation journal is a great part of the course but not really followed up on).","You get out of this class what you put into it. It's really easy to blow everything off, but if you actually involve yourself, it provides insight into start-ups and business.","The lecture topics get a bit repetitive. We learned a lot about innovation and the creative process. I was really into the class during the first three weeks of the course. However, toward the end of the class, I felt that we were learning the same thing over and over again (through different lecturers, guest lecturers, assignments). I wished there was more diversity in the topics that we studied."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Take this class ONLY if you're interested in innovation and entrepreneurship! Otherwise you will waste your own and everyone's time.","Great class, Weitz is the man. Take it if you're at all interested in pursuing any sort of business on your own, science-related or otherwise.","I would recommend this class for a specific type of person: one with a deep interest in innovation and startups. Otherwise the course lacks structure and organization, and I would skip it...","interesting with easy work-load and great group projects","Only take this class if you're looking for an incredibly easy joke for a class.  The professor actually falls asleep in class, even when his friends come in as guest presenters.  He also slept through out final presentations.  Also, it's full of the wanna-be business type students who make participation-based classes a nightmare to sit through.","incredible class","Really enjoyable class. One of the few classes offered that has true real-world applicability, particularly if you're interested in entrepreneurship and innovation. Very light workload, aside from the midterm and final group projects. Take as an elective!","This class is interesting, fun, and super easy. Very little work. I definitely recommend it.  The one downside is that all of the work is in groups, so if you get a bad group it could hurt you. Also, with essentially only two assignments, if you do bad on one, it's hard to come back (although the assignments weren't graded too hard).","The workload for this class is by no means difficult and the discussions and readings can often be enlightening and interesting. I would say the downside is that such a large percentage of the grade is participation, so most of the comments that people make in class and the questions that people ask can feel forced. They added more structure to the class this year than in years past which is good, but the feedback is still fairly limited. Good class to balance an otherwise difficult workload.","Course is very fun and interactive. Great elective.","The course had little work and was pretty easy, but I'm not sure I gained much from it.","The workload is not too intense in the beginning of the semester with relatively interesting readings and discussions. However, a lot of it depends on the people are taking the class with you, and how that dictates the conversations. The project presentations do take up a bit of time so work with your group early on to make sure you can get it done on time.","There is a lot of group work in the class. They assign you to a group, so if you don't like working with people you dont know, it is probably not the best class.","What you get out of it depends on how much you put into it","Be prepared to speak up in class, keep up to date on current technology news, and spend time on a group project","Take this course if you want to learn something about innovation and\/or start-ups. It's pretty easy, not much work and your personal benefit depends on your own interest in the topics","Low work load with one reading and short response per week on average.  The midterm is a group presentation and the final is a group research paper plus a group presentation on what you researched.  Both very easy.  The professor has a lot of guest lecturers with a wide variety of backgrounds which is very useful for a class that covers something as broad as \"innovation.\"  You may get bored with the material towards the end of the semester but it's worth sticking with it.  This is probably the easiest engineering course there is.","If you do not have a group that is willing to put in the work, you will spend the majority of your Thanksgiving break doing the group's work.","A great course with interesting subject material. Not too challenging, no technical experience necessary. Make sure you can work with groups, especially with people you've never met before.","Great class to take that is not time-intensive at all.  I highly recommend!","Interesting class that's not stressful.","You will learn a lot about the principles of innovation"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is enjoyable in that it offers a stress-free environment in which to talk about innovative ideas in most fields. The course revolves heavily around group work and video projects, so it is to your advantage to make sure someone in your group has strong video-editing skills. The course suffers from a lack of structure and really doesnt have all that much content. Prof Ricketts is one of the funniest professors I've had at Harvard, and definitely understands what students are looking to get out of this class","Was incredibly disorganized when I took it. TFs seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. Seems like all we did was prepare iMovies. Guest lecturers can be interesting.","pretty easy and material is interesting, but SO UNORGANIZED. don't expect to have a clear sense of how grading works either.","I'm not sure what I expected going into this course, but I didn't get much out of it. I don't feel like I learned much about innovation from the lectures save from the innovation consultant reports given by students, and the assignments, though few, tended to be tedious.","This class is interesting, but you are going to have homework every week and they are sometimes really time consuming and sometimes not so clear. Also, you are going to have to make videos about everything.","Very good class if you want to have a relaxing yet informative experience.","this class is ridiculously easy","Organization of the class is a bit off, but you learn a lot not only from in the classroom, but by working with others in groups.","this is a great class if you want to learn about innovation, creativity, etc. you do have to take everything with a grain of salt, but it's interesting to look at things under a new light.","It's a fun class, but required some time for the video assignments. But if you are interested in technology, innovation or science, definitely take it.","I would definitely recommend this course because it's mostly low stress and it's kind of cool to feel like an engineer student as a social science concentrator. The professor is extremely flexible about leaving class early and apart from a few select weeks, we had class once a week. For the material, some of it is interesting, but some of the visiting speakers are just awful. The assignments are not well defined which could be very stressful because you're not always sure what you're supposed to do until the day before. Your experience is absolutely contingent on the group you are randomly assigned to and I was fortunate to have a wonderful, diverse group of interesting multi-talented people. This class gives you an idea of what it's like to work in the real world because often times what's required of you is vague, but you have to get it done. A.","The class is pretty interesting, and has some really good guest lectures. However, it was very poorly organized, and the expectations for assignments were unclear. We didn't really receive instructions on how to do things, and those instructions that we did receive gradually came over the course of several emails rather than being consolidated in one.","The class material is interesting. However, a large component of this course is dedicated to learning how to present information. This is interesting and useful, however I think it detracts from the actual content that is supposed to be taught. Additionally, the course was poorly administered. For example, expectations for assignments were unclear, grading wasn't explained beforehand and feedback for assignments was either never returned or returned very late. That being said, it's easy and mostly interesting.","Possibly the worst class I have taken at Harvard. Teaching staff don't care about you or your work.","I loved lecture.  I got so much out of it and it was so interesting in ways I couldn't find anywhere else in Harvard. HOWEVER, the assignments were ridiculous video projects that only somewhat related to the material but certainly were not helpful for me to understand or practice the concepts discussed in class.  It was really disappointing.  I loved the material but the assignments were such a waste of time that tested my (non-existent) videography abilities so my understanding of the actual course was never reinforced or practiced.","It's a simple class, no need to go to lecture or anything. There is just annoying video assignments, and it is extremely disorganized.","The course is not particularly hard - 90% of the work is in groups. But there is so much confusion, and just utter chaos in terms of the class organization, which results in extreme ambiguity as to what is due when that the class becomes a nightmare. The entire teaching staff is incompetent (at least in as far as running this class goes).","There are some amazing guest lecturers and the information for the course is pretty interesting.","This class appears easy but it's a waste of time. Assignments were frequent and often not relevant to the course objectives. You never get any assignments back, feedback is pretty useless (or nonexistent), and grading is not consistent or justified (seriously, they didn't like the color I chose for my flow chart boxes). Guest lecturers were tough to take seriously. They would send multiple emails a day because they hadn't thought through their messages and included everything they wanted to say. Project were often unclear and took a lot of time (lots of videos, helpful to have video editing skills). I don't know, I wouldn't recommend this course. It's a headache.","I unfortunately have to say that this class was atrocious for three reasons: 1) disorganization, 2) droves of busy work, and 3) uninterested professors. I received about 50 times more emails clarifying and redacting things than in any other class. Sometimes, I would receive emails so close to assignment deadlines that I would almost miss the deadline. Some of the professors never talked in class. Why are they on the teaching roster? Last, these video presentations and 'proof maps', etc. really got on the way of my learning because most of our time had to be spent on meticulous video editing and not on actually learning innovation methods in engineering. I am sorry to be harsh, but I believe the class was unsatisfactory and needs to be seriously rethought.","If you want a class that has minimal requirements, this is it. However, unless you're super excited about innovation, this will most likely waste your time.","Do not take this course. While it might have been great in the past, they made a lot of changes this year for the WORSE. It was a waste of time (attendance at lecture is mandatory) and the projects are time consuming (almost every assignment is to make a video) but not educational. If you want to learn about innovation, take the course offered at the business school instead or just read a book about innovation. You'll learn more.","This class is extremely disorganized. You'll get last minute emails from the teaching staff, followed by additional emails from another member of the teaching staff correcting the last email sent out. Dates will change and random assignments will pop up. Unfortunately, everything is sent out through the tens of emails you'll get but not located anywhere on the website so things can get very confusing very quickly. I didn't learn too much from this course even though it sounded amazing -- I was very disappointment by the lack of attention the teaching staff gave to students and effort. I think this class has a lot of potential but unfortunately, it requires a lot of revamping for you to learn anything or feel like you're just doing busy work that takes up hours and hours."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Very interesting content. Very reasonable workload. Take this course.","This is a very good low stress class if you are into entrepreneurship. It is an easy class to coast in and get a good grade but if you do the very reasonable amount of assigned work and engage with the material it is a very rewarding class."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Although this class was easy, I got very little from it. The class was too big to have any meaningful case discussions, and the lectures were quite boring. The final project was interesting and fun, but we got very little help or instruction with it. Also, the teaching staff did very little in terms of feedback. Essentially, it was the situation where everything goes into a black box and out pops your grade. Still, for anyone who is interested in business or starting a company, this is a good introduction to this field, especially since there are very few business related courses taught at the college.","Great, pain-free way to learn about entrepreneurship and venture capital!  Listen during lectures and try to incorporate those lessons into your midterm and final project.","This course is a great opportunity to learn about innovation and everything surrounding entrepreneurship: it offers a valuable glimpse of the conventions and practices in this particular ecosystem, and the final project will teach you a lot!","Its very helpful and interesting (and also easy) but also disorganized. Don't get frustrated by that, just roll with it, because its ultimately a satisfying course.","This class is terribly organized but very minimal work. You are essentially expected to develop a business plan\/pitch based on one of several technologies for your final project. There are infrequent weekly assignments and sign-up sheets used for attendance. It was not a stressful class, but I find that I did not come away from it with any tangible lessons learned about innovation. Would not recommend as a good class, but a pain-free one.","If you end up in this course and it's larger than 20-30, it will be much more a lecture than a seminar\/conference course. You will still learn a lot. If you ever want to use your technical knowledge in business or might consider a start-up, this course will provide a very good knowledge base and possible networking for future endeavors.","This class has very interesting material and a low workload.","It teaches about how to do a pitch. Everything other than that could be learned from somewhere like wikipedia.","Good startup class to better understand how innovation is thought about from an academic perspective","Grading is absolutely random and based off essentially two assignments. Don't take it as a GPA booster, only take it if you really are interested in learning about startups in the biotech space. Talk to John Boyce and go to lecture, every one is really cool.","The class was inconsistent. Some parts were excellent, others were dry lectures. The course staff did not handle the huge course size well my year. Look to see if they've made improvements since then.","Its a interesting business school style class with little work requirements... take this class","Better organization would help improve the course.","Doesn't have a heavy workload. Instructions for assignments are nonexistent. Class seems very disorganized because there are so many people teaching it. Learned something about entrepreneurship from Weitz and Boyce.","This class was definitely the easiest course I have ever taken. It was honestly really fun and I learned quite a bit about innovation and entrepreneurship. Almost no weekly work and a very doable final presentation.","It's a very easy course if you want an easy 4th class, take it.","If you want an introduction to entrepreneurship, especially within the sphere of biotechnology, this is the class to take. Great material and teaching staff that you can learn a lot from in and outside of the classroom.","Grading is very unpredictable","Though the course sounded promising (real world experience pitching!  Working on tech the instructors actually wanted to spin out companies with!) it did not deliver.  It became instead an exercise in how to manufacture legitimacy by students who don't understand the technology.  I hope this is not what real biotech startups do :\/","This class can be quite disorganized. Grading seems a bit arbitrary at times and classes are sometimes randomly cancelled (though that gives groups more time to work on their pitch). However, it's really nice to be able to apply what is learned in class to a project that's pitched in front of a panel of VCs at the end of the semester. I also enjoyed having multiple professors lecture, since they all come from various fields and have various expertise and insight. Also, you choose your own groups, so be sure to pick people you think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll work well with.","Loosely structured innovation course with nice pitch at the end","Lots of fun and still learn a whole lot!","Not only does this class require relatively little work, but the work you actually have to do - developing a mock company and giving a full pitch on it in front of a VC panel - is really interesting and, depending on your career path, especially useful. Lectures are neat as well and some are pretty interactive, though be aware that they do take attendance (there's no section, though!). The only negative I'd say is that the class isn't well organized and clear guidelines for the assignments aren't really presented, which made the grading seem somewhat arbitrary and slightly harsher than one would expect. Still, this class is a perfect combination of useful, really cool, and not much work - I'd highly recommend.","The lectures and projects are great if you want to learn how to take an idea from inception to reality, how to build a pitch to give venture capitalists, etc.  Course organization was lacking, assignment expectations were often unclear.  Overall, however, I liked the course.","Amazing opportunity if you are into biotech and want to do a start-up. A bit lame sometimes. Ill-organized. Good grades for not too much effort.","NA","Worst class I have ever taken at Harvard. No structure, arbitrary grading, I basically didn't get anything out of this course.","This is an incredibly relaxed class that is also very stimulating, which is a great combination. You won't waste time doing meaningless problem sets or reading boring texts... the assignments and midterm and final projects are all great experiences.","139 Changed a lot this year, but the final project was on Biotechnology. I would recommend this to any student who is wants to learn skills in the intersection of business and technology. You learn tangible skills that will be useful to you.","you get to learn a bit about the process of innovation, you project will have to be biotech though be warned.","in its current form, this is the easiest class you will take.  However, if you want to work a little harder to learn a little more in an elective, they are out there.","Chill class","You get a good overview of innovation and entrepreneurship for a Harvard class. You learn about startups, venture funding, and hear from live experiences. The class is very disorganized, the assignments are vague, and your grade is ambiguous throughout the whole course. The course is very easy with zero work. So take it as an easy elective.","This class is a gem. It is interesting, with great professors and an almost non-existent workload. There are negatives, however. The class is disorganized, and you will not get adequate feedback on anything. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. One of my favorites at Harvard.","The course is quite disorganized and covers a range of topics at the surface. Some of the findings in innovation and quite straightforward and there is nothing in this class that was mind-blowingly different from what I expected. Final project helps you learn a lot, especially as they bring in real VCs, but because it is a group of 8, groupwork is a complete disaster.","This is class is a painless and very easy course to those who are interested in entrepreneurship biotech.","I'm not sure if it will increase your chances at success at being an entrepreneur but it was fun and made entrepreneurship seem more real as a a possiblity"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"76","response rate":"69.74","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 139","course_id":"1336","cat_num":"0994","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"14","4s":"25","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 139","course_id":"1336","cat_num":"0994","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 139","course_id":"1336","cat_num":"0994","1s":"23","2s":"16","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
