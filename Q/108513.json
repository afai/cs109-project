You should be very interested in the science behind photos - not just taking photos.","If you are interested in photography, you will enjoy this class. It is not a lot of outside work so taking it as a fifth class would be managable.","This class isn't about how to take pretty photos, but about how the pretty photos are taken by cameras that involve lots of dense scientific and mathematical functions.","Just bear in mind that this course is geared towards highly mathematical \/ theoretical individuals. The professor is great and nice, the theory is really interesting, but it is a little difficult to digest initially.","the course description does not match what we actually did in class - all the description says it that some familiarity with basic calculus is required. In reality, 80% of what we did in class was related to physics. So unless you have a lot of interest in physics as it pertains to photography, not just photography itself, then you will find it very hard to stay engaged throughout class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Not the most exciting seminar, but alright as an easy fifth class if you're mildly interested","Overall it was an okay class, but unless you're really passionate about physics this class might not be for you","You have to want to understand the physics behind the art, but if you have an interest in both the creative aspects and the technical aspects of photography, this class is wonderful. We covered everything from the history of the camera & darkroom development to digital settings and Photoshop.","Be prepared for lots of math. If you can't keep up it might be bad."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"1.00","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 34o","course_id":"1831","cat_num":"40867","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 34o","course_id":"1831","cat_num":"40867","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 34o","course_id":"1831","cat_num":"40867","1s":"4","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
