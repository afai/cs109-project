If you're itnerested in clinical psychology, this class is DEFINITELY for you - you learn so much about evidence-based treatments, how they're implemented, theories behind them, and also how to critique and improve upon existing interventions.

It's amazing."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Take this class! Professor Santucci is absolutely amazing - she makes a two hour class seem too short, she facilitates great conversations, and the interactive examples of treatments really make them stand out.

I learned so much and loved every second of it!","Lauren is the best!","Probably my favorite class that I have taken at H! Professor Santucci is such a great lecturer.
