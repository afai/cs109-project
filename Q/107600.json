She also cares a lot students' schedules. She also has some very interesting research that she does. I liked how she talked a little about the history and applications of operations research to introduce some of the topics she was teaching.","This is a good course for those previously unfamiliar with linear optimization.","There aren't many optimization courses at Harvard, besides this and APMTH 121. I HIGHLY recommend taking one of them since the material is very interesting, practical, and important to learn as an Applied Mathematician. Because this was a new course, it was a little bumpy, but I would recommend it for later incarnations. The material is very important and I do hope this class is continued to be taught.","This is a fantastic class! A really great followup to AM 121 -- you really learn not just how to apply optimization methods but why the methods work. Ozlem is very clear and very approachable; go to office hours if you're ever confused because she's great at clearing anything up! The coursework is very manageable, and Ozlem's very lenient when it comes to exams. As long as you put in effort, she understands and recognizes it.","Useful material, but lots of work (not necessarily too difficult, just a lot of it)."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["An excellent introduction to the fundamentals of linear optimization which will prepare you for future courses in convex optimization. Not a comprehensive overview of general optimization methods.","If you are looking for a theoretical understanding of linear programming, then this is the class for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for something that is applied, this might not be what you are looking for.","I got everything I hoped to out of this class. This is a great class for upper lever undergrads and first or second year graduate students.","I love optimization. This class is a great continuation of AM121 (Intro to optimization). I greatly recommend the class to anyone who enjoyed the topics covered in AM121. This class covers network optimization, which I thought was super cool. The workload is manageable (4 psets + 2 midterms + final project).","The final project will be very time-consuming, so make sure to factor that in to your choice of what mix of classes to take. The main difficulty I had with the rest of the class was getting myself to focus in class and the need to be self-driven to get in the work."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I took this course expecting to obtain a blend of theoretical grounding and practical applications.  The course is entirely theoretical and has left me feeling that although I understand the methods we have studied from an abstract perspective, I would not be confident applying them.","Optimization is everywhere, great course!","This course is a great introduction into convex and submodular optimization. If you are interested in this area, take it.","The programming problems are fun yet can be fairly time consuming.","Very interesting subject matter.  The psets are challenging and take a long time (save time for the programming questions), but Thibaut was very accessible for help and there are only 4 of them.  Overall, moderately difficult but rewarding.","The psets can be quite tedious and the lectures seem to lack coherence, by the end of the semester the trajectory of the class does not appear to be completely straight. The professor can be awkward but he is generally a good enough lecturer. It is an OK class.","Good for students with little background in optimization.  Students with knowledge of optimization may not learn very much.","It's important to have analysis experience to take this course.","This could be a really great course. But there are surely better courses -- e.g., surely Bertsekas at MIT teaches a good (better) convex optimization course.  Also a course offered in the math department by a mathematician not a computer scientist (computer scientists tend to abuse notation like crazy) might be nice.  Optimization can be so nicely taught through a lens of geometry too, but this course just doesn't offer it.  On the other hand, the course is pretty easy, the workload is light, and you get to see a glimpse (though actually a really really small glimpse) into what optimization is about."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"20","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 221","course_id":"1132","cat_num":"84323","1s":"2","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APMTH 221","course_id":"1132","cat_num":"84323","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 221","course_id":"1132","cat_num":"84323","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"12","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
