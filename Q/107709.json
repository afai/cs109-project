Because this is a practically-focused class, there is less emphasis on the theory of crystallography itself.","The lab portion is very helpful.  However, if you plan to learn the background and why things are so in crystallography, you'll have to work on it and look for a lot of the sources yourself.","Great lecturer and TF. I learned a great deal","This course is really good for anyone thinking about running crystals during their stay in graduate school.  The first lectures are pretty confusing and you may feel lost constantly, but once you begin going through the practical applications and learn WHY you are learning the material, you realize how helpful the class really is.  Both Shao and Tamara are really great, caring teachers and I highly recommend this course."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Only take this class if you actually have an interest in crystallography and you know why you want to learn to do it. If you are just taking the class because you think it might be easy, you will be bored out of your mind. If you are interested in learning to do crystallography, the class can be quite enjoyable.","Definitely consider taking this class if you plan to use the X-ray diffraction lab. Shao knows so much about crystallography and does a good job at introducing and reviewing the relevant topics. Mike was also very helpful in the course. They both care a lot about helping you learn and are accessible outside of class in case you need clairification on anything. There is a reasonable workload. The guest lecturers were also really neat! Shao invites many specialists in the field to disucss their research and its a great way to see the utility of crystallograhy.","The course will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of crystallography. Afterwards, you will have a much better judgment on the quality of structures in the academic literatures. It is very practical and the labs are fun!!","Shao is a wonderful person to get to know in the Chem department. His class is really useful if you want to learn about what crystallographers do and why it's awesome. Also, you get to go on a field trip to the Advanced Photon Source in Chicago to see how synchrotrons (circular particle accelerators) are used to really take crystallography to the next level, and to better know Shao and your classmates. Office hours are easy: Shao's nearly always in his office in the basement of Bauer where the diffractometers are kept, and he's super friendly so feel free to ask him anything!","This course is very easy, but successfully teaches practical crystallography.  While it can be boring and repetitive, the course is thorough in its practicality.","This course was overall a very positive experience. The workload was very manageable and the material was interesting and practical for any chemist interested in grad school (or already in grad school). Especially noteworthy was this class's trip to Chicago to visit the APS lab - that was an unparalleled experience and one which should definitely be taken advantage of.","it is a very interesting coursed, with a significant emphasis on the practical aspects of crystallography"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Take this if you want to learn about x-ray crystallography of small molecules. It's a good class.","If you plan on using small molecule crystallography, you should take this course. In particular, the lab section prepares you well for structure refinement."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHEM 255","course_id":"512","cat_num":"79245","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHEM 255","course_id":"512","cat_num":"79245","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHEM 255","course_id":"512","cat_num":"79245","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
