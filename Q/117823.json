I would recommend it to anyone with interests in the history of philosophy.","I loved the course, but it was very difficult","It is a difficult class and requires that you put time into reading the book thoroughly. It is a very good class though and the Critique is an excellent piece of work.","If you are really interested in philosophy, The Critique of Pure Reason is a must.  However, if you are just somewhat curious about philosophy, this might not be the right course for you.","This is a very difficult course. Only take it if you are familiar with philosophy in its structured and rigorous academic setting. This is not idle philosophozing.","You have to really like Kant and challenges if you're gonna take this course.","If Professor Boyle teaches it, and\/or Tom Fehse is the TF, take it. Otherwise, shop it and think carefully about it--Kant is filled with magic, but only when the right people are exposing it.","The class is challenging but extremely rewarding."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Fun, challenging class that will make you think.","If you like Philosophy, Kant is really a genius, and this book will likely change the way you look at the world. It takes work to begin to understand him though.","The material is certainly difficult, but the effort required is both enjoyable and productive.","Do not take this course unless you have a very solid understanding of metaphysics already.","This was a very good, challenging, thorough philosophy class. Masrour is extremely knowledgeable about Kant; not only is he extremely familiar with the material, but he also has really interesting, well-formed views about it. Walden as a TF is also extremely knowledgeable and a great resource; if you go to his office hours, he'll direct you to other sources, give you very straightforward advice, etc. This is a challenging class; it's Kant, and Kant is hard. But I took it as my first upper level philosophy class (I had Phil 3 under my belt), and while it was very challenging, it was definitely doable. You'll work hard, but you'll learn a hell of a lot, and get really deep into the really fascinating thought of one of the world's most influential philosophers."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you are interested in Kant, take this course. The First Critique is one of  the most important works in the history of philosophy and it is a real opportunity to devote an entire course to just that one work.","The material is extremely difficult. However, the payoff is immensely rewarding and Kant is such a fascinating thinker that it's worth going through his terrible prose to get to the philosophical meat of his ideas.","You don't understand Kant before you study him very carefully, and even then he's still very hard to understand. But this course is totally necessary for anyone who wants to have the real groundwork to understand later analytic and continental philosophy. Plus Kant is crazy and cool.","Excellent class. It helps to actually do the secondary reading that is mentioned.","This class is a very rigorous look at the central issues of the Critique of Pure Reason that you should take only if you are willing to devote a lot of time to it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"24","response rate":"45.83","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 129","course_id":"4050","cat_num":"0614","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 129","course_id":"4050","cat_num":"0614","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 129","course_id":"4050","cat_num":"0614","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
