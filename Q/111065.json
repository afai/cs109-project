very useful class for physicists and engineers, similar to applied math 104\/105 but a lot less plug and chug. Well taught by this prof, and not too difficult in terms of grading.","If the topics are interesting or relevant to you (which is likely if you are a Physics concentrator), then this is a great class that won't take over your life.","This course offers a nice mix of the theoretical basis for methods and techniques in complex and real analysis, while also motivating them with their applications. It was a really enjoyable class overall."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Great class for physics or applied math people!","Absolutely take it.  By course's end, you'll actually know how to calculate things using complex analysis.","Course, which covers variety of interesting and useful topics and which doesn't become too complicated. Lectures are enjoyable and intensive.","This is a great course.  You will learn a lot of useful math (working with complex numbers, neat integration techniques, differential equations, etc.) - and not just the applications, but also the underlying theoretical stuff - without having to work to hard.  In my opinion every physics concentrator (and probably anyone else who's planning on using a lot a math for whatever it is they do) should take this course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 115","course_id":"2854","cat_num":"1871","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 115","course_id":"2854","cat_num":"1871","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 115","course_id":"2854","cat_num":"1871","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
