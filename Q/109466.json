But it is more than a great elective. I took a lot away from this class personally. So this class is an complete win: enjoyable and low commitment. Just please do the reading! It makes the class so much more enjoyable.","This is a GREAT class. The books are so good and so are the movies. \"Mother of George\" is the most beautiful film I have seen, and I probably would never have heard of it if I hadn't taken this course. Also, the Prof is legitimately an expert in all things diaspora, so lectures are interesting. If you take this class, go to his office hours because he is great to talk to!","If you ever want to learn about \"Diaspora,\" this IS the course to take. Very interesting material, not too much reading, and old but thought-provoking films. Professor Jeyifu is also incredibly knowledgable about not only this topic, but seemingly all things... \"except physics\" he says. Don't take this course for reasons other than learning, won't get much out of it.."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.20","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"14","response rate":"57.14","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 140x","course_id":"10639","cat_num":"67506","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 140x","course_id":"10639","cat_num":"67506","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 140x","course_id":"10639","cat_num":"67506","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
