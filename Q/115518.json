It was very well taught and was insightful and meaningful beyond the context of the classroom.","Be prepared to learn a lot of new vocabulary! It takes time to learn.","This used to be independent study consisting of weekly 3-hr interviews with the department head which culminated in a 15-page research paper. Get as many people to sign up as possible and have the dept make it into a class. The course was much more enjoyable that way.","I was lucky to have Mr. Lee as my teaching fellow, but he's leaving after this year. I'm not sure if you'll have a tf as wonderful as him."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["The best class at Harvard.","Take it take it take it!

That being said, the readings tend to be significantly and relentlessly biased and one-sided every single week. Use the readings as a starting point to discussion and thought, but look up and consider other viewpoints before actual opinion-forming."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"KOREAN 150b","course_id":"885","cat_num":"1282","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"KOREAN 150b","course_id":"885","cat_num":"1282","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"KOREAN 150b","course_id":"885","cat_num":"1282","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
