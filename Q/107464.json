Highly recommend!","put in the time to do the readings and participate in class. you'll get more out of it.","Definitely take this course if you are interested in helping the world. Khanna opened my eyes to all sorts of unconventional ways to improve lives.","Think very carefully before taking this class. If you have an interest in South Asia, the material is fascinating, but since there's absolutely no accountability in the course I felt like most people didn't get nearly as much out of it as they could have. Also, be prepared for the lectures to be dominated by the majority of grad students who know exactly what they're talking about. Be very careful in picking your group for the final project - it will literally make or break your experience in this class. Finally, if you're the kind of person who is obsessed with grades, I would decidedly not take this class since none of us had an idea what grade we had all semester (we didn't get a single letter grade in the class, since we only formally turned in one assignment, which was returned to us with a few comments and no grade).","If you have the knowledge and desire to be making real social change in India today this is the course for you! If you are only looking to learn about the region perhaps look elsewhere since this course is more about practical application than mastery of new knowledge.","This class was one of the most interesting that I've taken at Harvard, both for subject matter and because its structure based around case studies since it's run by a Professor from HBS. It would be useful to have a background in South Asia, either to have family from there or have travelled\/worked there at some point. The grad students can be a bit overwhelming to keep up with just because they have so much already under their belts.","Overall this is a pretty good class, I learned a lot and really enjoyed doing the readings. That said, many people get by without doing most of the readings. Also, the group project is a good idea, but make sure you have a good group of people you know will work hard - there were a couple of people who didn't pull their weight in my group and it makes life really difficult, especially since it's very time-intensive and it is weighted for the bulk of your grade.","Definitely take this class, but make sure you go in knowing that although you will learn a lot, you will have no idea how you are being evaluated.","great exposition to different facets\/problems facing a new South Asia; focused mostly on urban life","This class gives you a great opportunity to work with other individuals excited to make a positive difference in South Asia. The course gives an excellent overview of complex issues in South Asia and gives you the opportunity to interact with experts in social enterprise in South Asia. Use this course to launch a new or existing social enterprise forward!","It was a good course with well defined intentions but since it was the first year that it was offered, the kinks weren't worked out as well as I would have liked them to be. I think it was hard to do everything the course required simply because a lot of it that involved creating a social enterprise in South Asia wasn't able to be done in a semester's worth of time. The readings and cases were really interesting though and gave a good perspective on South Asia. Sometimes lectures would get a little boring when it involved class discussion. Also, it's a lot of work for a gen ed.","The issues discussed in the course are really relevant and the course also provides a unique opportunity to exert creativity and ingenuity to take what is taught through case studies and lectures and solve these problems.","This course is for you especially if you have some level of knowledge on a project or venture you want to develop.","Professor Khanna is a really great lecturer. The class is application-based and current, focusing on attempted and potential solutions for social problems. You'll get more out of the class if you're knowledgeable about South Asia, but a very good class even if you're not. If you think entrepreneurship is cool, take this class. A good Gen-Ed for engineering concentrators."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a really interesting course that ends with a very engaging project. If you do the readings, I think you will get a sense of the energy of HBS classes!","Great class. One of the few that exposes students to HBS cases and professors. The students come from every school at the University. The reading assignments are multifacteted. And finally, the course is very managable.","They assign to many readings for you to actually do all of them, the lectures are kind of dry, and you never really have a sense for how your grade is in this course.","The key to this course is the final project. If you really  want to do well in the class, go into it with the mindset that you want to launch a venture in India. In this sense, the final project is much more time intensive than just a paper. Many of the groups are very keen on actually implementing their business plans, so be prepared to submit something substantive. Also, the project is not something you can put off until the last few weeks of the course. You absolutely must be working on it throughout the whole semester.","Working on a project or paper is definitely fulfilling, but the class lacks a good structure of support throughout the process. The material is interesting, but feedback on work done is limited.","Lecture is interesting and Prof. Khanna makes it discussion-based, but lecture doesn't seem entirely relevant to the deliverables. Section is a great way to talk more about the material and innovate - you get to brainstorm and debate solutions to the problems discussed.","Interesting introduction to a topic not normally explored in classes. Also allows students an exposure to the HBS style of teaching and thinking about problems.","The course, overall, was okay. I had a lot of high expectations from it in terms of learning about how to be an entrepreneur, executing ideas, etc. This course did not teach me that. The low coursework made me not care about the course as much as I would have liked to care about it. The professor is a bit rude, so speaking up during lecture could be intimidating. The final project for our group was total chaos, as we did not receive much help from the instructors.","You have to be prepared to participate. You cannot be shy in this course.","Lot of readings - try to skim at least the abstract, intro, conclusion, and tables of them. Really interesting lectures. I thought Professor Khanna was amazing and really liked the project aspect of the course.","This class can be a very interesting and a lot of fun if you are willing to put in work. If you just do the bare minimum you wont get much out of this class,but if you do the work it is very rewarding","It opens your eyes to how conceptual issues manifest themselves in the lives of Southeast Asians on a daily basis."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The class is a great way to survey various ways in which entrepreneurs in South Asia have taken a stance in addressing the prevalent institutional voids the region faces.","Couldn't recommend it highly enough. We discussed real world problems that exist in the Indian subcontinent (fair warning-- majority of the course focused on India, but the style in which problems across countries in the subcontinent need to be tackled is similar, so not that big an issue), and learn to critically evaluate approaches that have been made to solve them. I knew I wanted to do something for India, but it was a vague, abstract concept; this course was my lamp that lead me out of the darkness, and made my ideas more concrete. Prof. Khanna is a wonderful resource, great to bombard with any questions. In my year, the class had <10 undergrads; and around 30 grad students. Warning: I would be careful about taking the course if I were not from the subcontinent. I recommend doing it only if a) you've spent time in the subcontinent, or b) you understand the culture and issues a little bit through personal reading\/another class, or c) you're interested in developing countries and have a natural interest in issues there, and don't mind being one of the only people without specific background (doesn't necessarily affect how you write the assignments as you have time to research on them, and you'll still learn lots).","Very unique course that brings together students from a variety of disciplines and schools, allows you to take a critical eye to institutional voids in South Asia and the entrepreneurs that fill them.","This course is an excellent interdisciplinary look into South Asian affairs and challenges. Dr. Khanna is an engaging professor, but not all other module instructors will be as prepared, or present with the same quality. This is one potential downside of the course: module professors sometimes came across as not quite prepared due to their \"guest lecturer\" status in the class.  Joint ownership among all professors would help to improve this class, though I know that may not be logistically possible.","This class is very engaging and great overview of entrepreneurship in a very difficult environment - India.  The best way to maximize this class is to make use of all the resources available including not only Dr. Khanna and Gokul, but also your classmates.  One of the greatest strengths of this class is the eclectic selection of students around you (HLS, HBS, The School of Public Health, and more).  There is a huge range of people in this class with a wide range of skill sets from young students, to successful entrepreneurs."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is an awesome class that you can learn a ton from if you invest time in it. Even if you don't invest that much time, you will naturally gain a lot of really interesting insight into social innovation\/entrepreneurship and South Asia. Definitely take this course.","This class is amazing! It gave me a new framework to think about social problems prevalent in South Asia, and creative ways to begin solving them.","Take this class, it will broaden your mind and allow you to bring your own individual academic experiences, be they in mathematics, linguistics, philosophy or computer science, to a stage where you can have meaningful impact. This class is about using your education to do something productive, and is one of the few Harvard classes that allows you to feel that kind of empowerment. One of the best classes of my four years.","Very interesting class- great way to learn about social entrepreneurship and cultural and institutional context in South Asia. Very broad modules- so come willing to explore a breadth of topics.","TAKE THIS COURSE. What a gem, my god. Teaching staff is super into the course. Material is great. Assignments are actually interested and very manageable. \n\nTake this one - you will not regret taking this course!!11!!11","Awesome course. Being in a room with people from all across Harvard is a phenomenal experience and should certainly be taken advantage of. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS if you have even the slightest interest in South Asia. From learning about urban planning and heritage preservation, to micro-finance and social entrepeneurship strategies, this multi-faceted course is by far the greatest course I have taken ever.","This is a bit different from most courses at Harvard.  While most classes tend to give you content that you then have to replicate\/regurgitate on exams and other types of assignments, the point of this class is more to help you develop a skill set that you can then take with you beyond Harvard to make a difference outside the classroom.  For that reason I think the class is worth taking, since you have the opportunity to read and hear about the successes (and more importantly, failures) of predecessors in the field who have tried tackling problems in South Asia, through the guest lectures and case studies.  Professor Khanna is an incredibly smart man, and while at first it may seem hard to connect with him, if you do get the chance I would HIGHLY recommend it (he holds occasional office hours where he does 1-on-1 meetings, sign up!), since he is an incredible resource to have.  In terms of the class itself, in the short term it may seem a-okay due to issues such as disconnected guest lectures and somewhat arbitrary grading, but coming out of the class you will see that you have developed invaluable experience that will help you in the future.","This class was a great way to satisfy the Societies of the World gened. It is far from a gem, and requires much more work than certain gened courses. It is great if you have any interest in India or entrepreneurship. It is also the only class at Harvard where there is no lottery to take a class that involves HBS case studies.","great experiment of a class!","Take this class if you are fascinated with India and seriously plan to be an entrepreneur there. Otherwise, find a different class.","Get used to the case style format and that the class will have a lot of graduate school students. You have to make an effort to stay engaged.","This is a great interdisciplinary class about South Asia, with a strong focus on India.  Prof. Khanna is wonderful, and I loved the HBS cases that we covered.  Some of the many assignments are annoying and slightly time consuming but other than that a totally manageable gen ed!","This class is awesome to engage with contem. SA issues and it's a very painless gen ed too. You get what you put into this course, so if you take it seriously, you'll learn a lot. Teaching staff is very engaging and the content is super interesting.","It's a great multidisciplinary course for people interested in international development, entrepreneurship, developing countries, and the region. It might be a bit intimidating because a lot of people have an extensive background in the region, but it won't be held against you as long as you do the readings. Professor Khanna is very knowledgeable and guest speakers were interesting as well.","This class is really interesting, but the lectures are hit and miss.","this is such an amazing class. it is really not that hard, but you learn so much that is so relevant to our lives. definitely go to lectures, and do the readings (theres not much). the final project is really fun, and it's great working with grad students. the syllabus and introduction to the course make it seem a bit daunting, but it is very manageable and enjoyable. definitely one of my favorite classes so far","Great class to take. Makes you realize how you can make a business that also solves a need in a community. I learned how to think about businesses in the government\/NGO ecosystem through this class. At the same time, I was able to learn a lot about South Asia and current initiatives and needs in the area. The class maybe somewhat disorganized, though. Prof. Khanna's HBS-style lectures were my favorite because we got a chance to see how he and other students in the class look at different initiatives and say what contributed to their success or lack thereof."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"26","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 47","course_id":"2060","cat_num":"85573","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"13","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 47","course_id":"2060","cat_num":"85573","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOC-WORLD 47","course_id":"2060","cat_num":"85573","1s":"6","2s":"17","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
