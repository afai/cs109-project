You will learn a lot, and the subject matter is extremely important and useful.  I really enjoyed the open-ended nature of the course and the final project.  However, the class met Friday 2-5pm, which is not ideal.","If Sam is teaching it, take it.","Very good presentation of multivariate analysis.  Very mathematical."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Professor Kou's lectures move quickly and a lot of care\/preparation is needed between lectures do keep up with the material.","This is a great course and the material is interesting. However, it will be fairly challenging if you lack the proper prerequisites. Though it is possible to take a lot from the course without this background, don't undertake it lightly.","Prof. Kou is extremely clear and organized.  You always know what's going on and will manage to develop great geometric intuition for a lot of multivariate problems by the end of the course.","A very good course!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Builds great intuition on multivariate analysis and introduces some powerful tools. Not necessarily required but very helpful and thought-provoking.","If Sam's teaching this course, definitely take it. He's exceptionally clear and it's useful material.","The course is taught well, and the material is not only interesting, but also useful. The projects provide a great opportunity to deeply understand some of the topics.","This is an excellent course. The content is quite relevant in terms of modern statistical research, and is taught in a really exciting and intuitive manner without comprising much on mathematical rigor. And trust me, the instructor is amazing !","Definitely worth it to learn and gain fundamental intuitions behind key methods in multivariate analysis that are hard to find in other sources.","Kou is dynamic, but the class is certainly challenging; great, intuitive geometric approaches to a lot of concepts. Make sure you have a solid foundation in linear algebra.","Sam is an excellent professor, and this is an amazing course. It is one of the more difficult graduate level statistics courses I have taken, but it's worth it. The lack of a final exam takes off the pressure and allows you to focus on the material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"7.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 230","course_id":"4850","cat_num":"5206","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 230","course_id":"4850","cat_num":"5206","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 230","course_id":"4850","cat_num":"5206","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
