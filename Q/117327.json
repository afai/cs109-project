Exposure to various texts and professors (some of the best in their respective fields) was enjoyable and a fantastic opportunity for those still figuring out what their concentration should be.","Susan is great and the class gives you an opportunity to meet the Harvard Middle East faculty","This is an excellent introduction to the breadth and depth and the field of Middle Eastern Studies.","If you are unsure of the specific focus you would like to have within Middle Eastern Studies, this course exposes you to a variety of disciplines to explore in your studies.","This course was the best possible introduction to the A.M. program in Middle Eastern Studies I can think of. It provides you with an extensive overview of the subject and teaches basic skills necessary to succeed in the program."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would read Edward Said's Orientalism and other prominent academics like Albert Hourani to be able to place in context some of the texts discussed in the class which aren't necessarily books that haven't had wide exposure to Middle Eastern Studies literature.","Substantial reading but you learn a lot about what it is to be a graduate student.","Great books.","Keep in mind at all times that this class is an exposure to the full range of interests and expertise among Harvard's Middle East-focused faculty. Many of you may not be intrigued in the slightest by the assigned week of, say, anthopology, or pre-modern history. But in a degree program where your focus and trajectory are almost entirely yours to compose, this exposition of some very different approaches to the region we all find so appealing should serve as a valuable dose of perspective.","It's fun and you'll learn a lot.","Very enjoyable class. Susan Khan is a great teacher and very approachable!","This class is one of the broadest survey classes you could probably find about Middle Eastern Studies. This is very helpful for a field that is so interdisciplinary."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["All incoming AM students have to take it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it really is not an option!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MODMIDEAST 200a","course_id":"3852","cat_num":"5918","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MODMIDEAST 200a","course_id":"3852","cat_num":"5918","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"10","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MODMIDEAST 200a","course_id":"3852","cat_num":"5918","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
