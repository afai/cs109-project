course is very difficult to follow because the material presented does not follow standard textbook presentation. So it's very difficult to find references if you need help. Also, quite a lot of advanced material is covered very quickly.","I guess that even students who believe to know QFT quite well can profit from the sometimes nonstandard perspective, Georgi offers to QFT problems.","This is probably a useful class to take if you already know quantum field theory and wish to gain additional insight into the subject.","Unless someone else is teaching it, take the course at MIT."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["There are a lot of interesting things to learn, but it takes a lot of time.","This is a good course for those who prefer to learn independently and\/or in groups of peers.  The lectures themselves served more like motivations for more detailed, individual study of various field theory topics.","Professor Georgi makes this difficult subject into an interesting game. There is a useful viewpoint (and useful approaches) that one can only get from this course.  Also, before class look at the lecture slides and try to understand the general idea of them before class. Lectures can be confusing if you don't have some idea of the subject matter beforehand."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Make sure to supplement the lectures with several textbooks, and be sure to have mathematic textbooks on hand! In terms of the course work, make sure to work with and discuss the work with the classmates.","This is a great class and you will learn a lot. It treats the symmetries in field theory in depth and explores the consequences of many models in field theory. The expertise of the instructor in this field is second to none, and you will learn a lot from this unique treatment. It does not, however, treat the basic topics systemmatically so you will have to do a substantial amount of unguided outside reading.","Only take this course with Georgi if you have already taken QFTII once before. You will learn a lot either way, but prior knowledge of QFTII makes it a lot easier to understand the material."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Make sure you have the background and more than enough time to take this class if Xi is teaching it. It's confusing and time consuming!","The professor provides some insights that you would not find in the canonical texts. But you have to teach yourself this course, and there's so much material there that it's impossible to master everything in one semester.","The best way to prepare for this course is to run a marathon.","The course teaches a lot and teaches a lot of things required for research in HEP-th","I would like to take this course from Xi Yin a second time; I feel like I would follow it much better. Not for beginners.","Prepare to encounter sleepless nights the week the problem set is due because some of the calculations are going to take forever to get right. You will have to spend a lot of time reading the notes\/textbooks over and over to understand the topics completely, but it feels awesome to pass the course.","This course will take a great deal of effort and time. Do not take this course if you plan to conduct research, or are taking more than one other course during the semester. Do not take this course in conjunction with another difficult course.","Don't plan on having any free time if you decide to take this class. You belong to QFT now."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["It's a tough course, but you will learn A LOT. This course worths the time you put into it.","Given a second chance, I may choose to audit this course instead of enrolling in.","I would recommend to students in theory, otherwise they might not have the drive to get through the course","May learn ahead before go to class","Make sure you are able to put a very significant amount of time into this course; you will get a lot out of the course if you do, otherwise I would recommend auditing as the assignments get very difficult.","qft2 is well taught by Prof. Xi Yin.","QFT II is an excellent course. The class is very challenging and time-intensive, but the material is interesting. You need to have a solid understanding of QFT coming into this course if you want to get the most out of it. Overall, the course was very demanding but well worth the time commitment.","What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  If you're interested in quantum field theory, take this class but know that this class will require your full attention.  You will do things you didn't think you could do; they will try you; you will be better for it if you can make it through.","I would advise not to take too many other courses along with this one. It is fast-paced, and involves a lot of non-trivial concepts and lengthy calculations. I took 2 others, and found it difficult to manage time. But of course, you can be much faster than me (I'm slow at picking up new stuff), I know people who've actually done 3 more courses along with QFT-2. so it is totally up to you."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you're serious about understanding QFT and willing to put in the hard work and effort, this class will be a great help towards that goal.","This class is important for students from many fields, especially high energy physics and condensed matter physics. After taking one semester of QFT, this class will lead you to exploring the hard side of it.","This class takes a lot of time. I would not recommend taking this with more than two other courses.","This course is difficult and is not taught very well. More often than not, you will not be able to satisfactorily understand what goes on in class, but you will learn a lot by doing the homeworks and exams. You will have to read the textbooks yourself to be able to understand the things that you need."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"4.80","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"10","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 253b","course_id":"4125","cat_num":"5250","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 253b","course_id":"4125","cat_num":"5250","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 253b","course_id":"4125","cat_num":"5250","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"}},"success":true}
