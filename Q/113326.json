Unfortunately, the students' individual experiences in the course seem to be unimportant to the Harvard bureaucracy.","Recommended for people with an interest in economics, but this class gives you knowledge that is useful for everyday life-understanding the economy, how people buy and sell things. It's very difficult at first, and you will get frustrated at times, but it's part of the Ec 10 experience-you will bond with people and make friends in this class.","Useful info, extremely bureaucratic in its administration. Tests and p-sets are pretty awful.","This was my first introduction to economics, and I loved it (and am now considering concentrating in it). If you don't know anything about econ, I definitely recommend checking this out. However, be prepared for some tough problem sets and some fairly unreasonable exam questions. Also, MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD TF! I had a great TF so I really enjoyed the class, but I have friends who had horrible TFs and were miserable all semester. 90% of this class is taught in section, so if you don't get a TF you like off the bat, I would recommend switching into a different section immediately. Your enjoyment and learning are directly linked to your TF quality.","You will certainly get alot out of the class...if you are willing to put ALOT into it.","Don't freak out too much about the exams, even though they're long they're not too bad.","It is a must-take; however, it will not be what you expect in terms of learning economics from an economic guru.","Ec 10 is the type of class that every college student should take at some point. It allows you to understand economic policies and the basics of economics that drives the world. However, the way in which students are evaluated is frustrating, especially because you feel that the three exams you take during the course of a semester do not accurately reflect all that you know and have learned.","If you have a terrible TF resection because it will make your life a lot easier. Also take an economics in high school.","We all have to do it so just get it done.  It's some great standard knowledge of economics that no one should go without.","This is one of the most useful classes you can take at Harvard.","The material is important for anyone to know and I had a wonderful experience in this class, but you really will have to work hard and your section and TF can really make or break it.","Worth taking, just get a good section leader.","Hey there.  Hope you're having fun shopping for\/thinking about your classes.  I'm really glad I took this class.  Really fun.  But your Ec 10 experience IS contingent on your section leader, so try to land with a good, clear teacher, and switch out EARLY if your section leader isn't strong.  I'd recommend my teacher but he's peacing, so sorry not to be helpful on that piece.  Also, thoughts for seniors and\/or those taking this for an elective: pass\/fail is a nice option for this class, because there is a lot of work and it's nice to not have the pressure of a grade.  I still went to section and turned in assignments, but it was nice to not have to get all the nitty-gritty details and just focus on bigger concepts.  But you'll have to decide for yourself if you can get yourself motivated enough with pass\/fail.  To everyone: YOU ARE GREAT.  You are an awesome, smart, wonderful person.  Don't be hard on yourself.  You rock, so shine on.","It's not too challenging but requires time to learn...weekly problem sets sometimes take a lot of time","Take it only if you plan on being some sort of economics concentrator.","Not enough support. You are one in 600.","It is a difficult class but very interesting.","It's very time consuming and you will not get an A without putting in a lot of time.","Take this class if David Johnson is still head TF and make use of him. He writes the problem sets and the exams, so he is the best person to answer your questions. He will also make sure you completely understand the material. Start problem sets early, not the night before because you will NOT sleep if you do the latter. And again, go to David Johnson's office hours. Best decision I've made in this class was to go talk to him","It's a good course if you want to sample economics, but has some of the problems of all large courses.","EC10 isn't just a class, it's an experience. Taking it gets you into the exclusive club which includes about a third of your peers and it allows you to work with and get to know so many people.","It's a really big class and pretty much everyone is taking it, definitely THE \"freshman class\" at Harvard.","It is a great class that depends heavily upon which section leader you are assigned to.","I thought the course was definitely worth taking. I learned a lot however be prepared for a lot of work. Problem sets take a long time to finish and usually have to consult with section leaders for help.","start problem sets early so you can ask questions and be thorough.","The quality of this class for you really depends on the TF that you get, so if you don't like yours in the beginning, do everything you can to switch into a better section because that really makes or breaks this class for you.","This class is pretty enjoyable and the material is applicable to real life. The book reading very closely mirrors section, but it helps to read the book to reinforce the concepts learned in section. The problem sets are a lot harder than any of the examples done in class. The unit tests are a useful way to practice more difficult sorts of problems, and they help you figure out what you need to study for the midterms.","Ec 10 provides a good foundation for students in economics and should be taken by students no matter what they study, but the class is quite difficult.","Economics is not easy, but it is definitely worth taking.  It will change how you look at the world.  You will get some great tools for how to think about real world problems in a multitude of situations (not just as an investment banker).  I think that this is one of the few classes that everyone should take before they graduate.","Pretty legit class. Good lectures and great teaching staff.","This course is very helpful if you will major in Econ, and the material really helps understand what is going on in the real world. Yet, the testing is brutal. It's unnecessarily hard, even for me who scored  a top score in IB HL Econ.","Fulfill your requirements elsewhere.","This class is what you make of it. If you are interested in the subject and willing to broaden your knowledge on how the world we are living in today works, this is a good start.","This is an intro to Econ that everyone should take. That being said, do not fall more than a few chapters behind and pay attention in section. It's not terribly difficult if you get a good TF, but P-Set problems will confuse you if you don't have a strong understanding of the material.","If you are going to take economics, you have to take this class. If not, you should just to get a general idea of the topic... the class functions very well in that regard.","The class is a rite of passage.  It must be taken for economics, and most don't enjoy it.  However, it is an experience, and you can learn a lot from it.","It seems to be designed to weed people out of concentrating in economics.","Expect to do a lot of self-learning!  This is not a class where the professor cares about you.","This class is probably loved by those who do well and hated by those who don't. Everything really depends on your T.F. I don't know how to ensure getting a good T.F but if you do you're in good shape. You'll never see Mankiw but he's great when he lectures.","Ec 10 is an important course to take because you learn the foundations of economics which everyone should know. However, there are a few things to keep in mind: 1) this class is taught by your TF; Mankiw gives 4 lectures and you read his book; 2) the midterms and final are hard- the problems are harder versions of problems you have seen or problems you have never seen before; however, they're curved so people end up doing fine; 3) you need to stay on top of the work if you want to do well; 4) go to office hours, it really helps; 5) Mankiw is economically conservative and his opinions may bother you; keep in mind that you don't have to agree with him, you are in this course to learn the basics of economics; 6) get a good TF...this is extremely important","A useful introduction to fundamental economics.","Very helpful for many concentrations and your personal financial life.  Be careful how you section.","Try to switch TFs if you feel like you are having a really difficult time understanding the material during section.","Your TF is the key to whether or not you understand anything. Find someone who you connect with. Otherwise you'll have to work twice as hard to learn the material. Go to office hours. David Johnson is awesome and a great teacher.","Easy class, take the unit tests, very generous curve. You'll do well.","Definitely useful information and worthwhile to take","Ec 10 is not as practical as it may seem to outsiders who have never taken economics before.","micro is a bit dull, but looking forward to macro.","ALWAYS do the readings","this is sort of a rite of passage, and not enjoyable but often necessary. probably every harvard student should take this course, but that doesn't make it any easier to get through.","This course is very interesting, but make sure you have a good TF!","Be warned: this class, although not too difficult, is enlightening.  If you don't like economics, don't take it just because your friends are.","It's a hard class, but it's useful for anyone to take - regardless of your concentration, a basic knowledge of economics will help you at some point.","Stay on top of your work and review often","Little access to professor, hit-or-miss TFs.","The class is really intersting and I would recommend it to anyone even if you're not an econ concentrator. However it is a lot of work so just be prepared to put in the time and effort.","Don't just take it because you feel like you should know economics or to fulfill the requirement.  A lot of how much you learn will depend on your section leader so if you don't like your section try and switch out.  The class gives you an interesting perspective for viewer the world, but it may go completely against everything you know to be true about people and behavior.","This class has been one of my favorite courses at Harvard so far. I feel like I finally have informed opinions on political issues, because of a newly formed economic perspective. That being said, it's a fair amount of time (readings and problem sets)and only take it if you are interested in economics and math.","This is a great introduction to economics. I has a lot of interesting information that is not usually include in an introductory course of this size. However, the tests are written to the curve, meaning they are meant to be so that only 10% of the class does extremely well in the course, which is pretty discouraging. The problems sets are challenging and interesting. David Johnson (the head TF) is amazing, and going to his office hours are incredibly helpful.","Try to get a good TF","I learned a lot.","Its difficult and time consuming","Material is interesting and important to know about, but teaching is bad. Many TFs are not inspiring at all and problem sets have very little to do with was is taught in section and can be very frustrating.","This class is extremely boring, and if you don't know whether you like economics or not, this class will help you decide.","It's a hit or miss class.","do the readings!","If you feel that you need to have a basic understanding of economics, you should take this course. If you stink at math, or anything related, then you should definitely be wary as this class could hurt your GPA a little.","Not tons of fun but not too bad either. Good shtuff to know ya know?","To read the chapters pertaining to the teachings before they are taught in section because it makes understanding what is taught in section much easier.","If you are looking to learn the basics of economics and gauge your interest in this field, then take this course.","This class is amazing in the sense that everything you learn can be applied to daily life. You will find yourself referring to \"diminishing marginal utility\" in your every day life. However, while the material of the course is amazing, there are many problems with the course itself. For instance, the class is almost entirely taught in section, with little involvement from the instructor. Additionally, exams do not reflect material learned but rather heavily weight the course readings on the website. This makes the class a bit unpredictable. Take it anyway for economic knowledge!","It's a great way to fulfill a GenEd requirement, and economics is just something that everyone should have a basic understanding of as it's applicable to so many things occurring in the world around us; however, it has more \"math\"-y related stuff\/concepts than you would think, and it is a fast moving course so be prepared.","Take this class knowing that it is a very large and impersonal course experience. The midterms are very difficult to prepare for and the overall structure of the course may be frustrating, but the material is useful.","The results from this course will be as rewarding as how much you put into the course.","EC10 will teach you a lot about the behavior of humans, both in markets involving the exchange of goods as well as in everyday, real life situations (e.g. planning to exercise tomorrow and not following through). The textbook is great, and all of my interactions with the course staff (David Johnson, Prof. Mankiw and my section leader) have been interesting and positive.","Go to section! Bring coffee to Mankiw's lecture","This class is a bit of a hassle, but TAKE IT. Very important to understand how the world works, whether you're an ec\/government\/science\/etc major","Great for students who want a friendly introduction to economics; the workload is definitely manageable, and the course is more so about understanding the concepts than memorization.","Read the textbook, because it helps more than people think.","The Q scores for this class might not be that high, but this class is valuable and rewarding because it makes you feel so much better informed as a citizen and educated person.  I don't usually like quantitative subjects and didn't think I would like this class very much, but I like it much more than I thought I would.  Many people told me to take Ec 10 as a freshman if I was going to, and I think this is good advice - it gives you something in common with a lot of your classmates and makes it easier to find people to ask questions of or study with.","Ec10 was incredibly interesting and eye-opening. It was difficult, but rewarding.","it is a good class to take, even if you are not going to major in economics","Stay on top of the reading and find a good study group to do problem sets and you'll be fine!","This class is a good introduction to economics, and always relevant to everyday life; you will soon be connecting many issues of today to the concepts you learn in class, which is rather enjoyable.","It's not as bad as everyone says","not as easy as it seems...","Its a good class not too hard and most people can easily get a B in it.","Yeah, doing the work sucks.  It's super useful though.","Mankiw is funny. Go to lectures!","It is a great opportunity to learn about the economics behind everyday life, and behind the policies which affect us. You see the world in a different light after taking this course.","Take your time with the problem sets, and try to understand why each question was included.","Your experience is highly dependent on your TF and how good they are.","Problem sets are tediously long, but exams are curved tremendously, so it is pretty easy to do well. Just make sure you get a good TF!","If you come from a quantitative background, stay away from this class. You will feel a constant disappointment that the class hides simple facts about functions with hand-waving explanations.","Any student interested in having a competent understanding in how financial systems in the world works needs to at least have this class.","Great economics course!","This course can be a bit boring and tedious at times, especially when things are so simplified in the beginning.","Bottom line: a great intro to economics course.","Go to section, do the problem sets. Class is extremely easy.","You'll learn basic economics, but the class is rather boring. Take it if you need to take the class as a requirement or to take future economics courses, but if not, I'd steer clear of it.","The material is interesting and fundamentally useful- however the experience depends entirely on your TF. If you get a less competent one, resection for another.","The problem sets are very long and tedious (though not always difficult), although there are only six. The exam grading is arbitrary and inconsistent.","Econ 10 provides essential information that every person in the U.S. should know.  If I were in charge of the education system, I would make some form of economics mandatory in colleges.","Economics 10 will provide you with a solid foundation in the subject matter, but the course itself is not very engaging. There are very few lectures, and the sections seem to focus on material already covered by the textbook.","It is a requirement and an intro into economics that you do have to take if you want to go further into economics in this place. However, this course is not well taught and is rather challenging. Hopefully not representative of what studying economics is like at Harvard in general.","It's not as easy as some people say but worth the knowledge you gain. (and it's not hard either, but you do need to put in effort)","If you take it, you feel like you're really a freshman, and you will have no problem at all finding people to work on problem sets with.","You might not want to take it if you don't have a particular interest in the subject itself.","If you're interested in economics, this class is a good place to start. But realize that it's taught mostly by grad students and be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the concepts. Some people find the problem sets difficult, but if you spend time to understand the concepts (the textbook is helpful) they should be quite manageable.","Painless most of the time","The psets are not bad as long as they are done with collaboration, and the TFs are always ready to help. The lectures are pretty irrelevant to the readings, but random facts from lecture are put on the exams to make sure people go.","You learn the basics of economics while stretching your mind.","It definitely does improve your understanding of economics but you have to teach yourself a lot of the time","The exams for this class tend to test specific details instead of large concepts, and your experience is largely contingent upon the TF you get. Be sure to keep on top of the material, because it adds up and some exam questions pull from various concepts and try to fuse them. Work on problem sets in a group, and definitely go to your TF (if you feel comfortable) for help or review.","Even though this course isn't the most engaging or exciting that Harvard has to offer, you do learn a lot throughout the course. Your experience will depend a lot on the quality of the TF, but even if you don't have the greatest TF the course material ultimately isn't that difficult and there are numerous resources online and through other TFs. The lectures are interesting for the most part, and provide overviews of some interesting applications of the abstract economic concepts learned in class.","Its a good way to learn the fundamentals of economics.  However, Mankiw's lectures are extremely dry and exhibit a strong conservative bias.","it is so impersonal and self-taught and you are by no means guaranteed of success, by which i mean mastery, of the course.","I feel like everyone should have some basic knowledge of economics and this class is a good way to do it, especially for those who have never taken economics before. The class is challenging enough but really not too time consuming. It's fun to take it as a freshman because you can work on problem sets with your friends. Oh but you should take extra effort to get a good tf, even if that means changing to another section.","Worth taking, very informative.","It's easy to get disenchanted with economics as a result of taking this course--don't let it happen, though! Take advantage of office hours and ask questions. Read the textbook. Put time and thought into your problem sets. Do the Unit Tests. You will walk away from the first semester having learned a lot more than it felt like you did at the time.","It may be a pain, but you need the knowledge for the future, whether you are pursuing an economics degree or not. The course changes the way you look at the world and why things are the way they are. Beware that all assignments and exams have absolutely nothing to do with what is taught in class - they test your innate problem solving abilities, which can get frustrating. Textbook readings are hardly useful for evaluations - they are just for your personal enjoyment. TF quality varies tremendously, so choose yours wisely.","It's a good indicator if you'll end up liking economics.  If you're thinking about concentrating in Ec and despise the class, don't concentrate in Ec.  The class is rather bureaucratic, but that comes with having about 800 people enrolled.  If you ever have problems with the P-Sets go to David Johnson's office hours FIRST!  He writes the problem sets, and he is great at getting you to learn the \"intuition\" behind the problem, which will be helpful on tests.  \r\n         Other notes:  You're always crunched for time on midterms, so be prepared!  The class is taught in section with a few guest economists coming in to lecture throughout the term.  Having a good section leader is an invaluable asset in this class.  Go to the coursewide review sessions- you won't be disappointed.","The course material is very interesting but there are few lectures, so if you have a good section leader it can make all the difference in your understanding of the subject matter.","if you don't have any ec background\/experience, stay on top of the material, go to office hours, do the reading, do problem sets in groups, get a study buddy, get the help you need or you will fall behind. if you don't get a good TF, ask to change b\/c your success in the course significantly depends on your TF.","Besides the problem sets, there was generally not that much work. Just by reading the book and paying attention in section, anyone can do well in this class.","Take this class! Whether or not you think you hate economics, or think you will ever study economics again, this class is a must. Policy decisions make so much more sense after this.You cannot claim to understand the world without taking this class.","Have luck getting a good TA. And Mankiw holds only 5 lectures or so...so he is there mainly for the name.","It's a good course to take to gauge your interest in econ","If you aren't planning on concentrating in economics, don't take it! But since I am, I have found that I have learned a lot and it was a very good base class to take.","Ec 10 is a Harvard staple. Basically half the freshman class takes it, and it's a pretty impersonal class. The problem is that most of the TFs are not great teachers. You're not allowed to switch or shop sections, and so eventually it gets frustrating when 1 out of 10 kids has a great TF who actually explains the material (since Mankiw only teaches about 5 days of the year, when in fact he's a not bad teacher who should be teaching more), and the book, while well-written, is not targeted at the Harvard student and doesn't explain everything fully. \r\n\r\nIn the end, most people will still take Ec 10. But the sections are the worst I've ever seen, and this course simply justifies the common misconception that Harvard doesn't care about its undergraduates. It's a shame that such a helpful subject is taught so poorly at the school with arguably the greatest Economics department in the World. \r\n\r\nThe exception, the one exception, to this is DAVID JOHNSON, the head TF. He cares about us students, he cares about teaching, and he cares about economics. He writes the problem sets (and they're hard...), but when I'm ripping my hair out at 2 AM or ripping my hair out after getting a check (some TFs don't even grade your psets with letters...they do CHECKS AND CHECK PLUSES...what is this, kindergarten?) at my 9 AM section with a TF whom I don't fully understand because he has an extremely heavy foreign accent, I think of the fact that David Johnson explains how economics will matter, and how one of the 800 kids in the class will probably become President one day and will need to know Ec, and then I feel slightly--ever so slightly--better.","I loved this class. I never knew what economics was, and I had the impression that it was boring and that I would hate it. However, after taking Ec10, I actually have decided to concentrate in economics. I had heard horror stories about this class, so I was very hesitant when I started, but I ended up loving it. If you even think you might be interested in Ec or if you don't know what you're interested, take this course.","If you're simply interested in the concept of economics, take another course. The workload is too heavy for you to use it as an elective. But if you need to take it for your concentration, then it's a good course to take. Do your reading and you should be fine.","DON'T LET YOURSELF FALL BEHIND!","TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. IT WILL TEACH YOU ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD.","It's a required course for all economics concentrators. What can you do!","It's a solid intro econ class.","I would advise against taking Econ 10 unless you're thinking of doing a concentration or a secondary in economics.  There is another (gen-ed) econ class you can take that does not assume any prior background knowledge.","Best class at Harvard. Enthusiastic staff. Teaches you to think.","This class isn't entirely what I expected but it's still provides a good foundation. I can't say how it compares against the upper-level courses or alternatives because I haven't taken them yet, but this seems like as good a starting point as any.","It's not an easy course, but everyone should know how the economy functions.  Regardless of your opinions about economics or specifically, Professor Mankiw, everyone should take this course.","Something you have to go through. Not terribly enjoyable, but whatever","take some time to really learn the material because the tests are very tricky. they want to make the tests as hard and tricky as possible so you really need to learn the ins and outs of the material and how it all works together.","Easy for some, hard for others. Hopefully easy for you.","The problem sets are long and the midterms are tough, but you have a lot of resources offered to you, so use them all.","Take this class if you feel like you want to learn how to manipulate formulas and study diagrams.","Take it","Economics is important to know, even if just basic. This class covers quite a bit.","I'm really not a fan of the structure or the testing.","It is not that hard of a class but there is a lot of information and reading that is necessary to do well in the course.","Your TF is the person who will make or break your experience in Ec10.  There are very few lectures (which is a shame because the lectures are generally interesting), and all of the actual content is taught in section. I'd highly recommend doing everything you can to switch TFs if you don't like yours.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the only way to differentiate grades for such a big class is to have hard exams, be prepared for things you've never seen and exams that are too long for the allotted time.","You really have to enjoy economics to like this class. Don't take this class for the sole purpose of fulfilling a GenEd.","Ec 10 should be required of all students. Everyone should have the basic knowledge of economic principles that it provides.","You will do work but it is worth it. Your experience really depends on your TF though.","solid course. you can get a lot from the course no matter what your experience\/interest in economics. Not only for people on economics.","This is a coure that everyone needs to take. It teaches you the fundamental principles to economics - a field that impacts all of our lives every single day.","A good introduction to the basic principles of economics, especially since there is no other course at Harvard that offers you to explore the field of economics without previous knowledge. I often felt lost as to what the course expected of me and how to best answer questions on problem sets and exams. Therefore, make sure you get a good TF; knowing the material from the book is simply not enough to do well.","It will sometimes get boring but it's rewarding in the end when you can apply your econ skills to real-world situations!","It's a very good class that teaches you fantastic, interesting, practical things, but it is not easy at all.","A good introduction to economics, but generally the TFs are mediocre and it's a little weird only have Mankiw lecture 3 or 4 times the entire semester.","If you coast through this course, you might make a good grade, but it will be bland and might seem pointless.  But if you take the time to delve into the material, you'll be introduced to a new and valuable way of thinking about the world in terms of incentives and markets.  The lectures were by far the best part of the course and should be increased, as they revealed the real world problems economists are working on.","It's not too much work, it's a lot of fun, and it's an important class to have taken.","Don't be put off by the large numbers of people taking this course: it just means more people to help you out with problem sets and questions. Do the unit tests (more than once if you want) and anything extra that comes up, so you'll be ready for the midterms and the final.","Get a good TF","This is a good class to have under your belt. It satisfies a gen ed, it's good to know for any human, and it's not too stressful or demanding.","You need to be able to apply concepts to do well on the exam. Memorizing concepts barely helps.","Ec 10 is a great class to take, regardless of your concentration plans. You'll learn some very valuable tools.  Just be advised that the difficulty levels of the textbook, sections, problem sets, and exams certainly increase in that order.","It is harder than you think it will be.","It is a great preparation for the future in business and economics","Take it! It's interesting and applicable, and of course, is the required gateway to higher economics courses--I wish I had taken it freshman year","Difficult but worth it.","Ec 10 although an intro class is definitely a difficult course to take. There is a lot of reading and a lot of material to cover. This is definitely a course where you get what you put in to it.","Don't be afraid of your TF; it helps to actually talk in section.","It is very hard to do well in this class if you are not happy with your section.","Even if you have taken one or both of the APs, this course may still be challenging, as it was for me and I took both in high school. It is a bit more mathematical and certainly more intensive. It delves into topics I skimmed through in high school.","Something you want to take while you are in college. It's just all good to know ;)","This course gives you a very good, strong background in micro and macro economics that is definitely worthwhile. It's a big lecture course mainly taught in section, so don't expect it to be really personal or anything, but other than that I'd say take it--everyone needs the foundation this course provides in economics.","Although the concepts and problem sets can at times seem overwhelming, I feel that Ec 10 gave me a general understanding of economics that I will value for the rest of my life.  It really put current events in perspective, and it was amazing to hear some of the guest lecturers.","There is a lot of work to manage. Go to office hours and stay on top of all of the assignments. This is not one of those classes that you can ignore until the midterm or final. Begin everything assignment long before it's due.","You won't see much of your professors.","The test are incredibly difficult and the workload is difficult, but doable.","it gives you the basics of economics and by the end of the course, you will hopefully understand some of those terms in the Wall Street Journal.","I feel like Ec-10 is one of those courses that is just useful to take for the sake of learning some basic principles of economics and how they impact daily interactions in society. It's really useful and explains a lot of really relevant concepts, and isn't too much work!","Students should be ready to take initiative and study the material on their own.  Not everything will be covered in section, and if time outside the classroom is not dedicated to study and read, the student will be lost.","Your experience in this class unfortunately depends heavily on which section leader you get. For those who are lucky and get people like David Johnson, class is great! You learn a lot and leave the class with a much more positive impression of economics than if you had some less-amazing section leader.","David Johnson makes this class- make sure to at least go to his review sessions and\/or office hours if you are not in his section. Every politician should be forced to take this class.","It is hard, but you learn a lot and go in depth in applying the concepts to modern day economic policy making\/choices.","It's a great class. Read the textbook.","It covers a lot of material in a very short amount of time but the foundations of microeconomics are accurately covered.","This material presented in this course is fundamentally necessary to fully understand the world and interactions between people.  Though the course can be slightly challenging and at times a little monotonous, I think it is well worth taking.","Ec10 was great!  I say this conditionally because I had an amazing TF (Holger Wilms), and since this course is taught almost entirely in section, your TF determines a lot. Mankiw is actually a pretty interesting lecturer when he lectures, and most of the guest lecturers are quite good as well. There are only 6 problem sets (not 10 like the science courses!), and working in groups makes things go faster. Learning basic economics is something everyone should do--it's unbelievably relevant to everyday life, and this is a relatively painless course. Take it!","come ready to support all your economics-related intuition with graphs.","grind","I love economics, so I found the material interesting. Honestly though, this is not an intro to Econ class. I had 1 year of economics background, and I found the material moderately difficult. I would not recommend this course for people who don't have a strong background in Econ... If you don't but want to take this course or major in Econ, I would recommend sitting down with a friend for a while and discussing the main points of Micro\/Macro so you have an idea of what to expect. The sections are not representative of how hard the exams will be, so don't slack off. Also, I would suggest reading the textbook before starting the class.","It's almost an experience. Don't expect to be guaranteed to do well, problem sets easily take upwards of 6 hours each, sometimes more, and are sometimes mostly busy work. Definitely take unit tests, and take notes in lecture.","It's a good course for introductory economics, but it is a class meant to weed out all the potential economics concentrators.","Economics is useful to learn. Because it is so sweeping, it is not particularly focuse nor necessarily always interesting, but several of the topics are fascinating.","stay up to date on the readings! pay attention in lectures!","Mankiw doesn't teach this course. The TF you get is the most important factor for your grade.","This class is interesting, no doubt. However, it is hard! Make sure to stay on top of the readings and GO TO SECTION! Your success is dependent upon how much work you put in. Also, take the unit tests--the biggest mistake I made was not taking them!","If you are considering taking any economics courses for a concentration or just for general interest, take this course as a freshmen- it's great for freshmen bonding and is a good intro course that's manageable freshman year.","It is indeed taught primarily by the TF's. Though that tend to be a stereotype of Harvard, it is actually true in this case.","This is a good course if you really want to understand the principles of economics, but not a good class just to take because everyone else is doing it.","The course teaches you a new way to think.","Get through it","This course is time consuming and not terribly interesting all the time, but everyone should take it because economics helps to explain the way our world works. You will bond with your fellow freshman and be glad that you took it in the end.","It's a good course but it takes time.","Ec 10's a great class to take, even if you've taken AP econ in high school. Especially as a freshman, I found it helpful to take Ec 10 first semester just to ease into college life. You can always move up to Ec 1010b spring semester.","It is difficult but provides you with a good economics background.","Ec 10 is well structured and organized but often impersonal and hurried.","Take the couse! If you have a great section leader like I did, it's fantastic, and you learn a lot.","The class is very basic and includes next to no practical math.  If you have previously taken economics, you will not learn much of anything.  That being said, if you have never taken any econ, Ec10 is a good intro and will set you up to take any further classes in the subject.","The material is good to know, but be prepare to endure a lot of pain to do so.  Problem sets and exams are much harder than the material in Mankiw's book.","Solid work required, interesting course","Know in advance: for all intents and purposes, it's a class entirely taught in sections. The small number of lectures are in good part there for appearances' sake (though they also give some interesting application).","It is a great class to take but is somewhat difficult if you don't keep up with the readings.","If you are an upperclassman, do not take it unless you take it Pass\/Fail- you will not care to do the work, which will screw you","This is a boring class. You should only take it if you are considering majoring in Econ or if you feel that your understanding of economics is insufficient to understand current events. The number of concepts taught in the semester is astoundingly small, with applications to many apparently different scenarios that actually require no new conceptual understanding. For such a simple course, the material is explained surprisingly little. Even keeping in mind that everything we do in the course is an approximation-- something not always made clear-- some assumptions seem so outrageous that the usefulness of these assumptions is questionable.","Students should take this course if they want a good grounding in intro economics. However, be prepared for the fact that it actually a section based course. I didn't realize that TFs were the ones primarily teaching the material.","Workload is fair, material is dry sometimes, but a good intro course.","Take this class along with the other 90% of your freshman class. Everyone takes it for a reason.","Take it if you want to know what it teaches","If you want an introduction to economics, for any field you are planning on going into, there is no reason not to take Ec 10.  You will learn interesting and useful material that helps you better understand what is going on in the world.  If you work, you will do well.  The tests are simply a matter of studying--as long as you understand the problem sets and review material, and read the textbooks and supplemental readings, there is no reason you should not do well in the class.  Also, go to Mankiw's office hours if you have the chance, just to say hello!  I didn't have much interest in economics before, but now I'm considering taking more classes because I really enjoy it.","Be ready to work very hard.  This course teaches you a lot, but you have to be responsible to stay on top of your work.","This class can sometimes feel very impersonal, but you have to keep up with the work and learn the concepts. Exams are extremely difficult, but the curve is huge.","Take if you think you might concentrate in Economics. Or take Pass\/Fail to fill a requirement.","A lot of work, and pretty stiff, but if you get a good section leader you're golden","this class is not structured very well, and the quality of the course will depend heavily on the section you are placed in.","There is much to be learned in this class, but its impersonality and rapid pace can be discouraging and uninspiring. Come into the course with low expectations and a great deal of initiative, and you will have a decent experience.","Think carefully about whether this course is right for you to take, especially in your freshman year. Freshman year is a time for exploring new, exciting options, not getting stuck with a course that you may find quite boring. There is actually quite a lot of work in this course, and for some people who are not economically inclined the work quickly becomes tedious and the class becomes hollow. Also - there are problem sets, which can be long and stress-inducing. I'd day that you would have to be extremely interested in pursuing economics as a concentration or extremely interested in mico-economics in general to make taking this course worth your time and effort. One of the key lessons of this course is the concept of opportunity cost (forgone opportunities incurred from making a particular decision)- and with this lesson in mind i would really urge you to think of whether another course would be more worthwhile for you to take.","Make sure you get a good TF. Make up any excuse to transfer if you get a bad one. It will make or break your semester.","be prepared for a tough class and only take it if you are serious about concentrating in economics","It really helps you see the world in a different light.","A lot of work, but worth it.","Only take this class if you don't mind very little attention from instructors and teaching entirely in sections.","You better be ready to learn abstract concepts and own them. You need to stay on top of the reading or you'll never figure anything out on your own.","Class provides a solid understanding of the fundamentals of economics.","Read the helpful hints! They are your best resource for the problem sets.","This is a great class to establish the fundamentals of economics.","Ec10 was a highly demanding and pretty interesting course.  You will take up a large portion of your time completing the problem sets, but office hours are extremely helpful for better understanding the concepts.  Review sessions for exams are also really great, particularly if you have the magnificent David Johnson leading them.  Mankiw's lectures were decent, although much of what he said was already on his Powerpoint presentations.  The other guest lecturers, especially David Laibson, were phenomenal.  I loved having Raphael Rosenblatt as my section leader (though I believe he'll be finishing grad school next semester).","Unless you are really interested in economics, skip it.","Painful if you don't get David Johnson as your TF. Boredom saps you of the will to work, while tediously long problem sets keep you up at night. Take it if you need to","I would say that enjoying the course really depends on how well you like your TF. I like the material, and it's a good overview of economic concepts for people like me who took economics in high school but never really delved deeper than an extremely superficial level.","The material is interesting and presented in a clear and coherent way but the work you do for the class (problem sets, unit tests, and exams) is often confusing and sometimes might not feel like it reflects (or reinforces) your understanding of the material.","miserable.","Good TF required if you want a good experience. Even if your TF is not exactly sane, but he or she is good, you're very lucky. Until the TF selection process for Ec10 is improved, I hope you just focus on how practical and applicable the material is. I enjoyed my class because Laurence is a good albeit pretty odd TF (but aren't we all a bit weird...).","Make sure you are pleased with your section leader, because most likely that is the person you will be with for the entire year. I was blessed to get an awesome section leader, which made my experience much more enjoyable than those of some of my friends.","Try to think of everything that you learn as explaining something that you know but couldn't explain very clearly.  For some, it comes as common sense, for others it might be very difficult.  It also depends on your section leader.","Taking this course felt like playing a game, and I didn't really like it. Learning the economics wasn't enough - we had to memorize small details from the readings and textbook to do well on exams. It seemed like we were rewarded more for following directions and sucking up to TFs than we were for learning the material. Also, Greg Mankiw was supposed to \"teach\" the course, but I felt that his presence was minimal, and he could be considered a guest lecturer at best. Don't take this course unless you really really really want to major in ec, because I guess then you don't have a choice. If you want to take economics just because it makes you a better citizen, that's a good idea, but take USW 17 instead.","I would take this course if I really needed it for a concentration requirement, or a secondary field requirement.","This is a great course to take regardless of whether or not you want to concentrate in economics.","A good course to take if you are interested in an overview of economics. Be prepared for a conservative bent to the readings and lectures, and do not put of PSETs and studying for exams to the last minute.","This class is definitely manageable, but you need to be wiling to put in the time. The TF will make or break your experience- make sure to take advantage of office hours! The curve is definitely helpful, and you learn material in the course that will actually be useful in the real world.","Ec 10 is a course all students should take at some point.  While all Harvard students get a firm grounding in math, English, history, and science in high school, most enter college knowing very little about economics.  No matter what students end up concentrating in, it is important to understand how supply, demand, taxes, trade, monetary policy, etc. work.","This class really depends on your tf so if you realize in the first few days of class that your tf's teaching style doesn't suit your learning style, I would definitely recommend resectioning.","don't mess around","No need for much background on the topic. You will enjoy this if you are strong in logic and basic mathematics. It is an interesting look into the dynamics of the market as a whole.","My only reservation is that the exams are nit-picky","It'll be awful, but you just have to slog through it because they'll never change it at all.","Stay on top of the reading. It may be tedious at the time but it is much easier to go over the readings bit by bit than for 10 hours all in one sitting. Also, try going to office hours for different TF's, especially if your one is not that helpful: don't get stuck.","As long as you keep up with the assignments, you should be able to do well.","What you get out of this course totally depends on your section leader, or your determination to seek out an effective section leader who doesn't mind your sitting in on his or her section.","If you like numbers and applying math then this class will work well for you.","Don't be fooled by the big-name professor on the course description or the two first lectures in Sanders, this class is taught in section. If you don't get a good TF you are screwed.","EC 10 is a great course if you have a good section leader. Make sure to go to the unit tests as these are extremely helpful. David Johnson does a great job of holding review sessions as well.","I would tell future students that they will learn a huge amount of material from this class, and it is definitely one that they should take before graduation; however, I do think that the testing could be done in a more straightforward manner, testing on the concepts instead of testing on new ways to use the concepts.","Take this class because it is important to know these things; however, this course is conducted in the least fair way as possible, so find a good TF and form study groups with friends. You will master the material because it is easy, but do not get mad when your grades on the unfair tests do not reflect that.","The material's great, the lectures are a particular highlight, though there are few of them. Most of the material itself is presented in section, which makes your experience in this class somewhat dependent on the quality of your TF, especially if you depend on in-class presentation of material to succeed.","Problem sets and exams are very challenging but feature very lenient curves. Despite the section-heavy nature of the course, worth taking if you find microeconomics interesting.","Very difficult and time consuming, but a good way to measure your interest in economics.","It is a fairly straightforward class that is not very demanding, but fairly uninteresting.  I do enjoy economics, but still this class was boring and dull.  A large portion of the course is taught in section, and whether or not you have a good TF defines your experience.  My TF was boring and confusing, which certainly altered my perception of the course.  Mankiw's lectures are also quite dry, but some of the visiting lecturers were entertaining and interesting.","Do not take it unless you are seriously thinking about concentrating in economics. If you are, then it is necessary. If you are not, then there is no need.","This class is one of the largest at the college. As such, you'll be able to form study groups with ease. The reading and problem sets are not difficult, however, the midterms are quite intense.","It's a good class to take for the information you'll learn, but it's generally not a great course","interesting but the psets can be kind of annoying. It winds up being like 5 hrs of work every wk theres a pset and theres 6 psets a semester","Take it, because you owe it to yourself to learn how the world of economics fundamentally works and it is not terribly difficult (particularly if you have several friends\/roommates taking it), but keep in mind that much of it (sections, etc.) is not well taught and you will have to learn much of the material from the textbook.","Your experience in this course completely depends on how good your TF is - and don't expect to see Greg Mankiw ... at all.","The lectures are great, but not very common.","Although difficult, this course is very enjoyable and extremely interesting, especially the readings and the problem sets. You will learn a lot! If you are interested in politics or international affairs I strongly recommend that you take this course, as it will help shape and perhaps change your views on modern domestic and foreign policy!","Ec 10 is a good intro foundation, but the material tends to very very very coached in theory. so if you want things that are applied and relevant right away, I wouldn't suggest taking the class","Great class that builds the fundamentals of micro and macro economics.  If you like economics this is the class for you.","It's not as hard as its reputation.","If you're looking for a general knowledge of economics, this is the course.","Not really taught by Professor Mankiw, most of the material is taught in small sections with a TF. Therefore, your experience in this class varies with how good your TF is.","I think it's great to learn economics, and everyone should. However, if you really don't think you want to, and you don't like large, impersonal classes, I'd think of another way to learn economics. Remember that the course is a yearlong. It's nice that about half of your classmates are taking the class though.","take unit tests","Read the textbook, but this is only a preliminary prep. You have to read all the helpful hints because the questions in the mid term and final are nothing like the ones in the textbook.","Make sure to synthesize everything in the class.","Cross your fingers that you get a good TF.","This course is a must, regardless of what you want to pursue in life.","Your understanding of the material really depends on which TF you get. Be prepared not to rely on the book to learn the information.","Do your assigned reading before section. Not necessarily the whole chapter word for word, but the graphs and understand the general concepts introduced or else section will become a waste of time if you haven't.","Keep up with the reading, don't memorize graphs but rather understand how they are derived","The concepts are easy to understand but applying them to do well on the tests is very hard.","Provides a good background knowledge of economics that is necessary for everyday life.","Attending office hours is very helpful.","This course will teach you very useful and interesting material, though you may have to put a lot of personal effort in to feel like you understand it well.  How well you are taught the material depends heavily on your TF and his\/her teaching style, but no matter who your TF is you can learn the material from the textbook, which is really clear.  This class will most likely have a lot of your friends in it so you can work together on problem sets - without help from TFs and peers the problem sets are very, very challenging.  Also, the exams are given in very short time periods so that you feel pretty rushed.  But of course, that is the situation for everyone so the curve is always generous.  I'm happy I took this class because I knew nothing about economics before and now I have definitely noticed that I understand things in the news and casual conversation better.  The ideas you are introduced to in this course are very interesting and worthwhile, it just takes effort to master the material.  The lectures are usually pretty interesting as well - especially the behavioral economics one.  Be prepared to be a bit frustrated by challenging problems, but if you  want to take this course you'll probably get a lot out of it.","Take this class if you must but know that you won't get very much help.","Even though it's a lot of work, take it. It's important to understand the problems with the economy.","There is not much work, but when you do get work, it is very difficult and time consuming. The exams are very difficult, especially with the time constraint. The curve is very helpful though. The material is also interesting.","make sure your TF is good.","I think everyone should get an introduction to Econ. This class is not very well taught and incredibly impersonal, but there isn't really any way to get around taking it if you want to take Economics and haven't taken it in high school.","waste of time","Don't take this class just because everyone else takes it; it's challenging and requires a lot of work. Take it only if you enjoy economics or may want to concentrate in economics. You will learn a lot, but if you don't find the material interesting it won't be enjoyable.","It's a fun, fairly easy class with a lot of students who can help you.","This a good class and a pre-req for many courses.","Know the reading for the tests","Never get behind on the reading.  Make sure you treat class sections only as reviews\/summaries and not as you learning the material firsthand.","take it if you think you'll ever want to take an econ class at harvard.","This class sucks, but is generally the only way to get the micro requirement fulfilled by any concentration. I hear it gets better 2nd semester, and if not, that other econ classes aren't so terrible :)","Ec10 is a very manageable course. Basic knowledge of economics is useful for everything in life, so take the class!","very difficult course. Kills your mark because you can know every possible concept taught in the course and yet fail the exams due to required synthesis that was not demonstrated during the actual course","Make sure to choose a section with a TF who can speak English clearly.","The content is very important and the course teaches you to think outside the box and in a very useful way. The exams are difficult and the problem sets require a lot of time and effort.","This class can be easy, unless you prepare for it like it is. You'll be set for a solid grade as long as you make the effort.","If you are interested in concentrating in economics, or think you may be, then you basically have to take this course. Reading textbook chapters before section is helpful. As long as you don't fall behind in understanding topics, you'll be fine. If you do fall behind, tutors are helpful! Get one early!","Stay on top of the readings so that you may get the most out of section. Also before exams make sure to devote an adequate amount of time to reviewing lecture notes and additional readings in addition to covering the material as they have a great presence on the multiple choice section of the exam.","Take the time to go to the unit tests. They are a great way to study for the midterms and can boost your final grade. Also, refer to the 'Helpful Hints' PDFs for a quick review of the important topics.","This class is very mathematical and does not go into social theory often. It is also very right-leaning. It gives you a good knowledge of economics to expand upon later, though.","Only take this class if you are required to. While it's a good introduction to modern economics, don't expect the field to be treated as a social science. This is a purely-positivist treatment of neoclassical economics that has no interest in investigating the truth of its own assumptions.\r\n\r\nMore specifically to this course, the real problem is that there's huge leeway for the TFs in teaching their sections (which is where you spend almost all of the time in class) but absolutely none in the exams. So your success or failure depends much more on your TF than on anything else.","This course is awesome! I highly recommend taking it. It teached you alot about how the world works. However, make sure that you pick your TF right. The course can be miserable otherwise.","Read the book and do practice questions","I feel that a lot of the students in this class complained that it was a difficult course. I find this to be completely NOT the case. I felt this was one of my easiest courses. During the Unit Tests, which are optional extra credit tests that are graded in groups, many of the students in my grading group seemed to have struggled on very fundamental concepts. I really think that this is an enjoyable course as long as you are not both lazy AND incompetent. If you are either competent OR willing to put forth the time to read the textbook, you will do fine in this class and get an A with no problem. Possibly an A+ if you also take the time to do the Unit Tests for extra credit (they are short at only about an hour or so each). The one thing to watch out for though is that the midterm exams are also only an hour, but they are long. You must work quickly!!! or you will not finish.","really good intro to economics, take it as a freshman, do the chapter readings","It's not easy and sometimes pretty boring, but the subject matter is relevant and good to know for daily life","I didn't really enjoy this class, but it's necessary to further explore any interest you may have in economics.","I found this course to be really interesting, but the be prepared for some tough P-Sets and Hourly Exams.","This is a very interesting class, and provides the student with necessary information. However, it is not particularly gripping and is taught very similar to a fast, AP high school course.","It's harder than you think it will be. I came in with no economics background and while I don't think that put me at too much of a disadvantage, I had to work hard to understand things fully. Go to lecture because the multiple choice questions on exams about lectures are not that frequent but they do add up. Do well on your problem sets - that's like free points if you work diligently. Take the Unit Tests.","Econ 10, though a difficult course, is still one of those select few courses, regardless of your intended concentration, that you simply must take.","Good class. I thought it was basic economic knowledge that would be good to know in life but this wasn't completely true.","This is a good foundational course, but they do not consider some of the graver implications of the free-market system.","A solid introductory course to economics - enjoyable if you enjoy the material itself, although the course is not extremely engaging. The problem sets are helpful and the class is quite organized.","Firstly, you should know that this course is NOT taught by Professor Mankiw. Mankiw merely drops in occasionally to lend his wisdom (through lecture). So, most of this course depends on your section leader. If you're lucky enough to get a good section leader, you'll be fine. If not, then you're in big trouble. So, cross your fingers and hope for the best.","It is an informative course that will change the way you view the world, but you may be frustrated by the exams and lack of feedback on homeworks and tests.","You know what you are getting into if you take this class.  If you have an interest, take the class.","I enjoyed the material we learned, but the class was really difficult. Problem sets took me forever and I think the exams were really difficult.","Ec 10 is spectacularly boring. But (and this is a huge but) every well educated person should have some basic knowledge of economics. So unless you plan on taking Prof. Marglin's class (the only alternative), it is not a bad idea to take Ec 10. Just know that it will be anything but exciting or intellectually stimulating.","This class will help teach you how the world works. It's important to understand basic economic principles to be a citizen of the world - TAKE EC.","This class involves much more math than I thought. If you have a good TF, the course is much better. The unit tests are great, so take every one.","Really interesting course and more enjoyable than I ever would have guessed! If you've never taken economics, take this course. I recommend it especially for sophomores who aren't planning on majoring in ec, but want to learn something about it. I did much better than I expected and learned a lot. I'm a gov major, so I know the knowledge will help me a lot. Don't let people scare you - it's manageable and worth it!","It's a lot of work. Don't kid yourself.","This class will be very difficult if you do not have a good section leader.","Obviously this is required for a concentration or secondary in economics, so there is little choice in the matter. Beyond that it is actually a very good course to take because it does change fundamentally how you look at the world if you come into it without any background in economics, as I did. Nevertheless, the problem sets are time-consuming and this course should not be seen as a easy and quick A.","I do not recommend this course unless concentrating in economics is a serious consideration. In order to succeed in this course, you must be willing to teach yourself concepts that are nowhere to be found in section. If you've already taken economics, this course will broaden your understanding, albeit with some stubborn effort on your part.","It's a fantastic class to take. Whether or not you intend to study anything related to Economics, you definitely want to have a basic understanding of how the economy works. This class gives you exactly that.","The class is extremely thorough, but be prepared to learn one specific account of economics. Understanding the context for the principles that you are learning, and realizing that there are in fact alternative theories of economics out there, and that some disagreement exists about the maxims presented in the course, will certainly be important.","It's a great class! You learn a lot of interesting concepts with straightforward real-life applications. You have a better understanding of the economic world","Amazing class, dependent on section leader. Charlie is AWESOME. The concepts you gain in this class far outweigh most others in terms of practicality. The workload is intense, but definitely doable.","The class is interesting and informative, if slightly impersonal.  Would not recommend to take on a whim (unless one is very interested in economics), but one will learn quite a lot.","If a student is interested in economics, he or she should take the course.  However, since one only has a limited number of classes that one can take over the course of four years, 1 credit of this course is a lot to give up especially if he or she is not interested in pursuing economics in the future.","So much of this class depends on your TF. David Johnson was awesome, and presented the material in a way that made it accessible and easy to understand.","They try to trick you.","This is definitely a class I would recommend for people to take if they are thinking about becoming an econ major","You need to know this material.  Unfortunately, this is the only class that teaches it.  Hope for a good section leader and go to their office hours.  Try to sit in on David Johnson's section if you can -- he's the actual professor this course and the only one who knows how to teach it.","This class is good in teaching you economics, but it is one of those classes that a lot of effort is put in for little return.","While it has its faults, It's a good all around class that most people should take.","Very logical course. Go to section and ask good questions.","Yes","Worthwhile.","Its a somewhat necessary evil.  If you read the textbook (written by Mankiw) then going to section is perfunctory.  The exams are tough, but the scale is by section, which is helpful.","The material in this class is very interesting, but the way it's taught is done poorly. The professor lectures about once a month, and the rest of the time you're with the TFs. My TF didn't teach very well, and I ended up having to go to another section for help.","There's no getting around it if your concentration requires it. If you like it, you'll have a good time. If you don't, you'll get over it.","Don't let the fact that Greg Mankiw is the coursehead deter you from (or attract you to) this course. He teaches a grand total of 5 lectures a semester. So 90% of the course material is taught by your TF. This is really luck-of-the-draw, but it seems from what most people say that most TF's are good. Personally, mine was excellent and I got a lot out of the course.","The only reason for recommending the course is that while difficult, it is curved and ec10 serves as the basis for all other courses in the social sciences and is a good foundation to have in any educational background.","It is a good introduction to economics and it's not all that difficult.","It is very interesting and I learned a lot, but it takes up a lot of your time and the problem sets and exams are extremely difficult.","if you wanna do well youve got to do some serious studying","Sorry, but you're screwed - not only is it a major gen ed but a requirement for most concentrations.  Mankiw has set himself up nicely to profiteer off students","This class was easily my least favorite Freshman Fall. Preparing for the tests and doing the problem sets was very difficult to me and it felt as though the studying I was doing was not accomplishing much in terms of grade results. The only reason I'd advise someone to take this course would be to give a Freshman an idea of whether or not they should concentrate in Ec. If you're just looking for your EMR gen ed, look elsewhere.","The amount of work you need to put in varies wildly from section to section, so just hope you get placed with an easy grading TF or one brilliant at teaching. Also, there are better and easier ways to get the math requirement out of the way.","The material is fun and important to learn. The course can be challenging, but there are a lot of different resources available to help, so it is important to take advantage of those (unit tests, office hours, review sessions, etc).","Ec 10 is exactly what its reputation says of it. You should take it freshman year so that if you need to switch to Ec concentration down the road its out of the way.","This class is an amazing way to better understand the United States and the world at large through a unique economic perspective.","It was very interesting.","This class gets hard...fast.  It's valuable information to know, presented in an interesting way, but be prepared for some sleepless nights and burning questions.","On a personal level, I intensely disliked this class because I discovered that Ec is just not for me.  However, I recognize that the class itself was very good and very well organized, my TF was very enthusiastic, and the material was practical and applicable.","The course is poorly taught. Lectures do not match section at all, and you are literally screwed if you get a bad TF.","Class is pretty standard. Problem sets can take more time than you expect. Hourly exams were fair. Final was hard, so really prepare. Having a good TF is essential. Go to David Johnson's review sessions.","If you've never taken an economics course, take this class.","good intro but boring class","Be ready for too big a class.","Very tough class, but very informative and a great way to be introduced to economics.","Make sure to do all the readings but practice as well because it is not just about reading the book but getting down the synthesis.","Get a tutor, Go to office hours and put in the time.","Take this class if you plan to major in ec, or if you'd like to gain a good comprehension of how economics works, but if you aren't concerned with either of those things take a more interesting\/unique class.","Great class, applicable to all areas of study here, so take it!","it may not be fun, but it's an important class to take","helps gain knowledge about everyday happenings","It's huge, but it definitely is a bonding experience.","The class is an extensive economics class, though difficult because of the problem sets and exams.","This classed changed the way I look at things. It's a classic Harvard class. It's a must-take!","Go to office hours for Professor Mankiw and David Johnson.  These are opportunities that few students take advantage of.","This class, regardless of whether you plan on being an economics concentrator or not, is beneficial to general knowledge.  The concepts you will learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of the social and political realm such as the current economic crisis, the mortgage crisis, and healthcare.  If you want to be a well rounded and knowledgeable individual, this course is for you.","It deserves the time necessary to truly learn.","little work, lots of interesting things","Be prepared for hell in the form of p-sets and exams.","Mankiw only gives a few lectures, which was a bit disappointing. However, the section leaders are very good for the most part and if your goal is to gain a solid knowledge of microeconomics, this is a great course.","There's a really generous curve. The class itself depends largely on your TF, so either transfer into a good one or make friends with people who have good TFs so they'll explain it to you. This class is easy for some, hard for others, so it depends more on your ability to learn the material and apply it to practice problems rather than any background you have with economics. AP Economics is helpful, but I have friends who took it and are still struggling.\r\n\r\nDO THE READINGS. You'll understand the material better, and it'll be useful for the exam.","Read ahead in the textbook. You absolutely need to do the assigned readings.","It's a good first taste of economics with a strong attempt to connect econ to current events and relevant social issues.","Your section leader can make or break your understanding of the material.","What section you are in really matters. Go to lectures.","It is very helpful to do the textbook reading for this class, and while it may seem like a waste of time because a lot of the material is covered again in section, it will make a huge difference on exams.","If you have done AP Economics, you really should not take this course. It is a nice general class; the guest lecturers are great. It is entirely taught in section, so don't expect a lot of lectures by Prof Mankiw.","Do not take if not serious about economics.","Future students should know that they are not guaranteed an \"A\" in this course simply from working hard.  Economics is a subject that you can study hard for and still mess up at the test if you don't realize the synthesis of certain topics with other topics in the (often challenging)free response questions.","your grade will depend almost entirely on how good your TF is","to really understand and do well in this course, you need to adopt the mentaility of an economist. You need to be able to see everything from their perspective in order to ask the right questions and ultimately arrive at the right answers.","While it is a class that is useful for understanding economic debates, it is poorly taught.  Because so much of the course depends upon your TF, and your choice of TF is somewhat out of your hands, it is honestly not a gamble I would recommend.","It's difficult but it's not too bad...definitely a class that everyone should take, just to have a basic grasp of economics.","Prepare for the exams on your own and well in advance. Do the problem sets with buddies from your section or others. Do past exams and do ALL the readings (easy points on the exams). Be sure to be aware of what's expected assignment wise.","The class is not too interesting or too engaging, but it is a fairly simple and clear introduction to economics.","Be prepared to teach yourself the material.","A must take! Can change your way of thinking and analyzing the world.","A lot of work that you are expected to do on your own. Forming study groups is key!","This class is not what I was told it would be. It was much worse.","you pretty much get what you expect -- a huge class that's almost entirely taught in section. you can teach yourself everything if necessary (it's not hard material), but having a good TF makes a huge difference. just hope you get a good one.","Everyone should have an elementary understanding of economics, so everyone should take this course.","Not as easy as I'd expected it to be. The difficultly level of the class has been increased since last year. The readings are subjects covered in section are simple. The homework and tests were extremely difficult.","Some Econ background in high school is a big benefit, though not completely necessary.  The material is very interesting, but there is rarely individualized attention outside of your TF.","Ec10 is great for concentrators and people just interested in economics and learning about how to reason when it comes to markets. It is very enjoyable and not an amazingly difficult class as long as you go to section.","Do not take this course if you are a conceptual learner. This class has a lot of math-oriented topics, but it is not taught like a math course. Thus, you are left teaching yourself how to turn concepts into applications. This is not reviewed in section or in the lectures.","You learn a lot, but it can be hard and somewhat slow at times.","I really enjoyed taking EC 10 because I have a good TF. If you get a good TF, not only would your life be easier, you would also love the material significantly more.","This class is really interesting and I loved the readings, sections, and lectures. The problem sets and tests were more difficult but there are extra credit opportunities and plenty of support available. Also, if you don't get a good TF the course can be completely ruined for you.","An interesting class with moderate difficulty if not previously exposed to concepts.","I feel much more capable of being an educated voter after taking this class. It's so relevant to daily life.","You'll have to teach yourself everything. If you're doing any sort of social science, it's kind of a painful necessity.","- Experience definitely depends on the TF you get. But make the best out of it by going to their office hours. If you don't feel like you're getting the most out of your TF, then go to other sections and office hours.\r\n- Put more time into reviewing readings and notes, as it makes studying the ridiculously hard exams easier. There's a LOT of material at the end to cover, so just make sure you keep on top of things throughout the semester.","Everyone should learn some economics. It describes how the world works. Without it, the ability to make educated decisions and determine and explain the motives of others' actions is significantly reduced.","If you have never taken an econ course, take it. It will change the way you think about the world.","This course provides you with a strong background in microeconomics.  Though the problem sets and exams may seem daunting, there are a lot of resources to provide you help on these assignments - office hours, review sessions, study groups.  Additionally, the class does a good job of interspersing small sections that teach the material with lectures that demonstrate the applications of the material.","If you don't understand stuff, go to David Johnson's office hours!  And READ your textbook!","Economics provides skills and knowledge that is vital to understanding business both personal as well as in the nation or world at large.","Understanding the basic principles of economics is important and interesting.","Think carefully before taking this course. It can be quite boring and seem pointless. That said, it is not necessarily so. If you do take the course, don't get caught up in the general EC10 hate that a lot of Freshmen and undergrads seem to perpetuate. Think for yourself and if you like the course like it! \r\n\r\nThe problem with the course is that it seems very dictatorial - it is a series of facts which unless you have some motive (ie wanting to concentrate in economics or be a consultant) it may become quite difficult to motivate yourself to learn. \r\n\r\nDo think SERIOUSLY about alternatives like SW17 which people have taken and enjoyed. It is shorter and covers critical perspectives on economics which I now realize, personally, would have been much preferable to the dictatorial, sometimes very trivial and knit-picky details of EC10.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you want a very solid understanding\/grounding in economics and more than just a general understanding of ec (in terms of being able to read a newspaper etc) then you this will probably be a good course. Of course, my intuition is that if you are that passionate about economics already you may well have picked up a textbook like Mankiw of your own volition and could have taught yourself much of the material.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to summarize the course succinctly. A lot also depends on the section leader you are assigned (if you are Fall Freshman, that is the person who will lead the smaller-size classes which are at the foundation of the course). \r\n\r\nNote: Mankiw barely teaches this course, your actual teacher maybe (nay, is more likely to be) much less able if not pretty terrible. Do consider the benefits of a different economics course and avoid this one if you can.","This is a difficult course, and the grading is somewhat unfair.  That said, it is probably the most practical class I have taken at Harvard, and if you get a good TF, you will learn a ton.  Don't be afraid to take it as an upperclassman."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Be aware that this course will fall short in teaching quality and motivation. You will, often, be on your own, and you will have to deal with the professor's, the course's, and the textbook's inadequacy at providing a well-rounded presentation of economics. The course as a whole is biased to right-wing economics and if you are interested in learning in an environment that raises questions and debate, this course fails miserably. \r\nIt does, however, succeed at giving students a basic working knowledge of basic economics; if you are thinking of taking it for this, then do it (I did), but be aware that the overall experience will probably be lacking.","This course is a new way in which to view the world.  It is moderately difficult and requires a desire to go beyond the required material in order to fully understand the concept and their real-world implications, but if you do that, it is rewarding indeed.","If you don't need to take it, or you can take another Economics class, don't take this class.","Ec 10 teaches you the concepts you need to know to understand the world and specifically the news. It is definitely a big time committment and can be difficult, so you need to be willing to work at it.","Ec10 Macro is a good deal easier than Ec10 Micro.  The most noticeable difference is that the problem sets are much more straightforward in Macro.  This class is a good litmus test for prospective Ec concentrators.  If you really enjoy doing the problem sets, think about concentrating in Ec.  The guest speakers are awesome.  Find a good section to attend.","lectures weren't that great; section was really helpful, but that's because i had a really good TF. some of the pset questions and the grading scheme were kind of ridiculous, so you really need a deep understanding of the concepts in order to do well.","Confusing and unpleasant.  I regret taking the course","Everyone should take some form of economics.","If you've taken AP Econ, consider taking a higher level course. If you do take this class, take the unit tests.","Everyone really should be required to take this course. It's extremely useful and the class is fun if you approach it with the right attitude.","Stay on top of the readings.","Good class. I'm not an econ concentrator, but I will certainly use what I learned in this class. It will shape many of my choices in the future.","The course is a great introduction to anyone who may be interested in economics. The things you learn are very useful and applicable, and you can get a good grade if you just commit to doing all the readings and going to lectures\/sections. If you are not willing to put the effort in, I would advise against taking the class.","Do not continue with the macroeconomics half of Ec10 unless you really enjoyed microeconomics and have a strong desire to learn about international economics and public policies involving economics.  Your experience with Ec10 strongly depends on your section leader, so play close attention to his\/her teaching style.  Ec10 challenges you to think about a hundred different variables affecting a situation all at once.  The problems sets take many hours to complete, but office hours are very helpful if you are struggling. Definitely take the Unit Tests as they give you extra credit AND are really great practice for the hourly exams. Mankiw may get the credit for the success of Ec10 (with minimal involvement), but it's really up to you and your TF to make the experience and learning process what you want it to be.","This class embodies every possible negative stereotype of classes at a large research institution: a barely-there professor who barely every lectures, unregulated and not at all passionate teaching fellows, a grading curve that makes no sense at all. This is easily one of the worst classes at Harvard.","This class made me see the world in a different way. That sounds very cheesy but it really was applicable to real life and I think will really help me in the future. Even if you don't want to concentrate in anything close to Economics I would still take it.","This is a great comprehensive overview of economics that will be helpful to everyone, even students not considering concentrations with any ties to economics. This course does however come with one caveat: it is luck of the draw if you get a good TF or not and that makes all the difference.","I enjoyed micro more than macro, but macro is more applicable to the real world","take it if you need it","Alright Ec 10, you've given me a full year of your sections, lectures, and problem sets. I'd like to separate my review of the course into two parts: the first addresses potential students, and the second addresses whoever is in charge of Ec 10. Let's start with the students.\r\n\r\nFirst, this class has fewer lectures than, well, anything. This is not a lecture class. It's taught mostly in section, and the lectures are a sorry afterthought to what you learn in section. Logically, then, your experience with Ec 10 depends on which section leader you get.\r\n\r\nNot only do you NOT get to pick what section leader you get, you don't really get to switch out of the one you're assigned to. Why would they do that, you say? Well in my experience, it's because the quality of section leaders in this course is below the standard of other courses at Harvard (I'm looking at you, CS 50). \r\n\r\nI loved my section leader, so this is not even a personal opinion. When you have 20 students in Lamont Cafe trying to finish a problem set and 3\/4ths of them can't figure out what the question means because their teaching fellows either (a) didn't explain the material properly or intelligibly, or (b) didn't teach the material at all, you know there's a problem. It's really unacceptable. But I'll get to that in a few paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to get some substance out of this course. The \"Helpful Hints\" online are pretty good. But this course really shines in David Johnson, the head TF. If this course was taught in lecture by him, I would give each of these ratings a perfect score. He somehow communicates ideas with ease and clarity. His review sessions taught me more in an hour than my section leader did in a week. That's what is unacceptable. There is such a disparity between TFs that what you get from this class depends on who teaches you. It doesn't affect your grade much--your grade is normalized across section--but the administration of this course has repeatedly said that this course should help you with real life, with understanding real events. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, let's have some more lectures please? Professor Mankiw, I love you. I really do. But we either need to see you more often in Sanders Theater, lecturing us with your nectar-like wisdom, or you need to put David Johnson on a pedestal and have him teach a chapter a day (seriously though, he could do it). But your segmented way of teaching Ec 10 using untrained TFs who teach different things at different times is NOT okay. \r\n\r\nFreshmen: you'll probably take this class. But I think you'd get more out of this class if you just bought Mankiw's 218th edition textbook and taught yourself (the textbook is very well-written) than if you toiled through 9 or 10 AM sections for a year, potentially learning little in the process. If you do take it, do your best to learn the material, and don't rely on the course itself to teach you anything. If there's anything that shocked me into college after coming from high school, it's this class.\r\n\r\nLeaders of Ec 10: you need to change some things. Yes, there are a few cute freshmen who are SUPER interested in Economics. They're the ones who stick around after lecture to chat with the speakers, or visit office hours. But if you want to keep your spot as one of the most popular courses at the College, you need to get your house in order, and fast. Take a few pointers of CS50. Aim for the highest quality TFs--and here's a tip: SMARTER TFs does not mean BETTER. There are people I had for unit tests who explained concepts better than my section leader. You need to get people who can eloquently and clearly explain these concepts for people who have NEVER taken the class before. You need to teach the lowest common denominator. If you can please the person who takes this as an elective, you might be able to actually teach some students some quality economics.\r\n\r\nAnd give David Johnson a raise. And make him a lecturer. Seriously. He's Ec 10's last samurai.","No one has any idea what's going on. Just learn how to take a test that you don't know any answers.","it is a useful class, but there are too many students in it to be taught effectively and to be graded fairly","I would take it merely because it is a prerequisite course for virtually every course in the social sciences department and is also a general education course. That having been said, however, the course in and of itself is not remarkably rewarding unfortunately.","Have a genuine interest in economics pior to this course.  Do not simply take this course because it's a popular freshman course.  It can become easy to get behind on the material and coursework if you are not interested.","This course introduces you to all the basic intuition behind the economics ou read about most frequently in the news.  You'll rarely see Mankiw, but if you get a good TF, the course can be very rewarding.","The second semester of Ec 10 is actually really interesting! I liked macro a lot better than micro; it really is a lot more applicable to real-life issues. If you took Ec 10 in the fall and are somewhat unsure if you want to continue, I encourage you to do it. It's worth it - you'll learn a LOT! Quick note, though: spring semester Ec 10 is a lot more fast-paced.","This class is useful and gets me to think about economics even outside of class. Although the lectures are large and impersonal, if you get a great TF and you understand the material, you will love the class.","Not as painful a class as everyone says.","I found out I definitely am not interested in ec.  The class itself was okay....I just personally really didn't understand a lot of it\/want to understand a lot of it.","Make sure you make the connections between the principles and math you're learning in class and real-world applications of economics; also think critically about the curriculum, because it sometimes has a conservative bias.","You will hear many complaints about this course, many of which are true - it is large, it is sort of impersonal, and your experience does depend on your TF.  That said, this is the best way to get an introduction to economics at Harvard.  The second half of the course especially really enables you to see the world around you with a new perspective.","Be warned -- this course is not as easy as it seems. You will definitely have to put in work into getting a good grade, and sometimes, you'll think the tests are somewhat unfair because they disproportionately test lectures and online readings. However, you will lead the class with a strong grasp of basic economics, changing the way in which you think about the world.","You will have some of the best Economists in the world lecturing in your class.","A necessary evil.","This is the most important class you will ever take at Harvard","Take this course if you want a great, thorough introduction to economics.","Macro is better than Micro","this course will make you work hard and what you get out of it will depend strongly on the strength of your tf","Might as well take it because like a third of the class does","Take this class at your own risk. You will only have a rewarding experience if your TF is good. Otherwise you are on your own, trying to catch up to what all your classmates are learning in their sections and you are not. I had an excellent TF first semester, and a very poor TF for the second, and that made all the difference.","very interesting material and a great introduction to economics for those who don't have any experience\/knowledge\/background in the field","your experience depends on your section leader","It's not an enjoyable experience. I found that most kids who went into the class planning on being ECON concentrators went out of the first two weeks no longer wanting to be ECON concentrators.","If you have any interest in learning about how economies act in the real world, I'd recommend United States in the World 17 instead. This course has a terrible structure (taught almost entirely in section, but with exams standardized across the course) and refuses to deal with the shortcomings of economics in any way. Overall, it's probably the least intellectually-stimulating course I've ever taken. The material is easy and easy to learn, but expect to feel like a middle schooler.","This class will provide you with a new framework to approach the world, and everyone could benefit from taking it.","This class lacks individualized attention and unorganized. Section basically teaches you nothing, and just spits out what is in the textbook. However, if one does devote time to study on one's own, it is highly rewarding and one can learn a substantial amount from this course.","Wonderful course! This class is beneficial for both those who plan to concentrate in Economics and those who plan no further economic studies. I learned so much in this course from the leaders in economics that are applicable to the \"real world.\" My experience with Ec 10, and especially in learning from my great TF during section, made me discover that I want to continue further studies in, and possibly even concentrate in, Economics.","Just pray to god that you get a good TF or else you'll be doomed. I ended up learning most of the materials by myself.","While it is tempting to take this class, since so many people take it, and since it is an easy class, it is a total waste of time. If you are interested in economics, take Ec 1010 or 1011 instead, which will be a harder, much much more interesting and rewarding.","This class is a must take it will give you an amazing introduction to all pertinent issues in economics.","A necessary evil","This class is really great. The material is applicable to real world examples. Definitely a Harvard Experience. But, the tests are questionable. \r\nUnit Tests don't do anything when everyone does them....","For Ec10, you very much get what you put into it. Most of the course will be self-taught, and when you have questions expect to wait a while at overcrowded office hours. If you love economics, this course will be great for you. If you're just curious about economics and are looking to fulfill a math requirement, this is not the right choice.","Good for teaching econ concepts but it really isn't enjoyable. It seemed like a chore to do sometimes.","brutal course. don't take it unless you want to be an ec major. I don't know why you'd want to be an ec major though...","This is a broad strokes class- don't expect detail or derivation of models\/formulas. Also, remember they're teaching to the masses- lacks personal aspect.","Valuable information, but only take it if you're really interested. A year is a long time to sit through something you hate.","This course is very interesting and rewarding. I am so glad that I took this course, since I now am able to understand a lot of political discussions that I would not have been able to understand before taking this course.","The grade you get is random to some degree :(","It is a really rewarding class and the material is very interesting, but you must put in a ton of work in order to do well.","Ec 10 is one of the most practical classes you can take at Harvard, and for that reason everyone (not only Ec concentrators) should take it. It makes you understand how the economy works, and you read articles differently after you actually understand GDP and inflation and how oil prices affect unemployment. That said, I found it to be difficult a difficult class-the textbook is lovely, and problem sets are \"challenging\"...but you will make some of your best friends and best Harvard memories while working through psets with others late into the night in dorm basements.","It's an interesting course that all students should take.","Tfs are great, useful course if you want to know the basics of economics, but I would not reccomend taking it. I would have rather read a book on the principles of economics and just educated myself to gain a basic understanding of economics.","It is useful information that everyone should know.","I would definitely suggest taking this course not only because it's well-designed but also because I've found that an understanding of economics can really help you see current events and other fields in a very different perspective and with greater understanding","Take Ec 10. Even if you think economics isn't for you, it will open you up to understand how the country is really run.","You might as well take it.","It's a huge class, but the material feels really practical and is very interesting.","This is an amazing course and definitely worth taking for any student.","Ec-10 is an interesting class that covers basics economics and gives you a sense of what you concentrating in economics might really be like; although not the most engaging class, it can be more involved if you choose to put more into it.","It's a great class, and definitely take it for a good foundation if yo're concentrating in economics!","Economics 10 provides a useful background in the subject matter, but the course itself is not very engaging. Most of the time is spent in sections working on problem-solving methods. There are a few guest lecturers who cover some interesting topics, but unfortunately, these are infrequent.","it's pretty easy, but expect all the problems that come with a huge class like this. it's hard to get solid feedback on stuff, especially exam answers. some of the lectures are...sleep-inducing. still, it's a decent intro to economics and if you like the subject it's worth it.","take it if you're required to","If you want to be an economics concentrator, take this class. If you decide you don't like it after the first semester, DO NOT do the second semester. I regret this decision so much. It does not get better after the first semester is over.","Ec 10 rewards you for the amount of work that you put into the class. If you do all of the readings and attend section, you will do well. This class is taught predominately by TF's, so just hope that you get a good one.","good intro econ course, can get tedious at times though","Ec10 is a very solid introduction to economics... you will definitely get a feel of the broader subject and understand what you would be getting yourself into as an Ec concentrator.","take this course only if it's required or if you are interested in getting a basic ec background, but i wouldn't say it's fun or thrilling or super engaging","Ec 10 gets a lot of flack, but it's not that bad. Plus, I feel like I did learn a lot of things I didn't know before about the economy.","This course will give you a very solid introduction to the fundamentals of economics. Be aware that the psets take a while, and that the exams will likely own you. Fear not, the curve is considerable.","read the articles","It's a terrible class that is unfortunately a requirement for ec concentrators. Don't take it as an elective, even though I think it is very important for everyone to have a basic understanding of econ.\r\n\r\nThe subject is great. The course is bad. Seek out other entry level econ courses and take those instead if you are able.","It is a very tough class with a lot of work.","It really matters who your tf is.  If you don't like your tf, find a way to switch.  It completely changes your experience in the course and really influences how much you can learn and how well you do.","If you have any interest in economics, this course is a necessity. If you have any desire in understanding basic political debates that touch on economic issues, this course is a necessity.","Macro is tougher than micro, so try to stay on top of things. It's harder to cram and be successful since the concepts are a lot more interconnected.","This is not an easy course, but it is a fantastic one.  I left EC 10 feeling incredibly well educated about economics. Given that our world is so global today, economics (especially macroeconomics) affects all of us in many significant ways, and I for one have a different (more enlightened) view of the world.  I think EVERYONE should take this course. Seriously, I might make my own family take this course.  We should all have some understanding of economics.","Good introduction of the basics, but I don't like the way its taught.","Anyone should take this class because it is very relevant to what's currently happening in the world.","This class is difficult and a lot of work. If you get a good tf, you will learn a lot, but if not, you will probably struggle. I'd recommend taking this class later in your college career pass\/fail.","it is good","Definitely a class you should take in your four years.","Very difficult, exams are arbitrary","It's a necessary evil.","Make sure you have a good TF or else you would have to spend a lot of time on your own to learn the material.","If you take this class, you'll soon realize that Mankiw's just the figurehead. David Johnson, the Head TF, is the person who writes all the Psets and Exams, and he's a VERY good teacher. I highly recommend this class if you're interested at all in knowing more about the world, and I think the knowledge I've gained about the economy from this class is something everybody ought to have. Just be prepared for some frustration along the way.","take it. easy class, easy curve, and you don't want to be screwed over and have to take it as a soph or a junior if you didn't think you'd want to take a class that has it as a prereq","Students should take this class for the foundation of knowledge they will obtain; however, they should not take it because it is easy or very enjoyable.","Be prepared to work your butt off. It's easy for some, but most people I knew spent days studying for the final exam...without moving from one spot. But you can only study so much...","Get a good section leader. That is what makes the most difference in how well you do in the course.","I am very glad I took this course.  It is a moderate amount of work, but it is very applicable knowledge.","This is certainly a class worthwhile taking. Be sure to keep up with readings and do all unit tests.","Only take it if you are willing to put in the time to understand it.","If you work hard you will do well in the class, but working hard involves keeping up on the readings and paying attention in section. If you slack off in the beginning of the semester it will be hard to catch up.","While Ec 10 is a lot of work and can be stressful, the material you learn is extremely interesting and useful.","Pay attention in section and read the helpful hints and practice problems.","If you are going to take it, understand why it is you are going to take it.","Great class. Every Harvard student should take it.","Ec 10 is a course that isn't too difficult to get a good grade in if you put in the time.  Make sure you keep up with the readings - procrastinating this will definitely come back to haunt you around midterms and finals season.  If you keep up with the work, go to TFs office hours, and make an effort to review the online materials provided, you will be able to do well.","Good information, just some parts really suck.","The material covered in this class will give you a strong foundation in economics. However, the class is poorly done. The teaching fellows do not teach well, and what they teach do not appear on the PSETs or exams. Additionally, the head TF makes the exams way harder than anything that's covered. He says that during the exams, you should be \"learning\". That's not exactly what you want to be doing during a test, especially if you've taken the time to study the material.","The class is necessary, but could be better taught. Section is amazing, my TF and David Johnson really dedicated a lot of time and energy to the course. However Professor Mankiw was practically non-existent outside of a few lectures and the occasional office hour.","It is one of the worst taught courses at Harvard. Not worth your money, but unfortunately a requirement. Consider taking 'A Critical Approach to Economics' (US in the World) if you can.","This course requires a lot of outside work.  Make sure you keep on top of the readings and take advantage of office hours.","This class was very mind-opening in terms of learning about how the market works.","This class sucks","It is a very rewarding class because the material is very applicable to real life. The exams are difficult but the course is curved very favorably so the grading is generous.","Be prepared for some hard work. If you are willing to put in the time this could be a very rewarding course.","It's taught with a mildly conservative bias, and assumes absolutely no knowledge of calculus; it can be very frustrating for informed students.","This is a great class that helps you think about the world in a new and more robust fashion.","It's not perfect, but given the nature of the class (with hundreds enrolled) it's a pretty good effort.","Your grade will not be determined by how well you know the material, but instead how much you play the subjectivity game.","It's a good class to take. You should definitely do it before you graduate.","Take this class if you want to be able to read the newspaper and understand what is going on!","Economics gives the basis for understanding not only the economy but how life and society runs. Take this class.","About economic theory.","i'm not sure i'd take this course again unless I wanted to major in economics.  I feel like there must be better ways to learn basic economics without so much math","Ec10 gives you a basic understanding of economics that is very helpful in understanding of current events such as the economic recession.","Go to David Johnson's office hours!! Do the problem sets well and make sure you understand them - they are the best way to learn the material and great preparation for the midterms\/final.","Take this course if you want to learn the ABC's of economics. Sometimes, grades might not reflect your enthusiasm or actual knowledge in this field, which can be disappointing. But that is not the purpose of this course so what you should get out from Ec 10 is your understanding of how people manage scarcity and how they live in a market system. Economics is a euro-centric field as it originated from England and it is a field that might seem volatile because reality and theory do not always go together. Honestly, this is frustrating. But David Johnson makes it all the more lively so I would say, take it.","I thought I wouldn't really like economics that much and that I was just taking this course to become a better informed citizen.  I do feel like I'm a much better consumer of information now, but it also turns out I like economics a lot, and I'm thinking of getting a secondary now.","This course is superficial and uninteresting. The material is not presented persuasively, and we are expected to internalize assumptions rather than understand why they are true. Part of the reason is the avoidance of math; some of this material, it seems to me, cannot be taught honestly without rudimentary calculus. Instead, we assume that all relations are linear. Though I think a case can be made for the usefulness (if not veracity) of this assumption, the fact that the course is based on it, and no justification is ever given, smacks of intellectual corner-cutting. The case to made would be that if actual economic relations are not linear, we generally have little knowledge of them beyond the first linear approximation.\r\n\r\nIf you like memorization classes, this is not a bad choice. Otherwise, avoid it.","Learn a lot but it's a lot of work","its tough, but interesting.","Macro gives you a lot of knowledge you should really have to better understand the American economy \/ the federal government's monetary policy \/ what the Federal Reserve does. It's also not too hard--just a lot of memorization and practicing formulas. I would say: take it!","To read the chapters to be discussed in section before you cover it in section. Will make section a lot more comprehensible.","Sit down, do the readings, go to lecture and section. you should be all set.","it's a required class for ec concentrators and secondaries -- you'd have to take it regardless. macro has real life implications -- you'll get a better understanding of the financial news after taking this class.","It is a lot of work, and difficult, but it is very interesting and a lot of useful information was taught.","Don't take it unless you have to.","The material is very useful and it's great when you read a newspaper and actually understand the terms.  However, this is not an easy class (the exams\/psets are a pain to go through), and there is a lot of material that is covered.","While many people complain about Ec10, I found the material pretty interesting. I think the class gets its bad reputation from the exams, which can be a bit unfair at times, but if you stay on top of the work and study a decent amount the workload is absolutely manageable.","I am very glad that I took this course. I feel that to be well educated, a basic understanding of economics is essential. Many students may steer away from Ec 10 because of the size of the course, but I didn't really find it a big problem. Section allowed for small discussions, and the course brought in very impressive professors. Ec 10 is also lucky to have David Johnson as the head TF. He is an incredible teacher - energetic, funny, and passionate about Economics.","This class is not too difficult if you pay attention in class.","This class is designed more as an introduction for those certain they want to concentrate in Economics - not those who only want to take one economics course.","The quality of your time in Ec10 really depends on your TF. Overall the course serves as a good, detailed intro class to economics.","This class may be a little bit biased sometimes (very occasionally), but it does inform a person of the basics of economics and really helps a person understand a lot of the things people talk about on the news about economics. Also it makes a person a more independent thinker as one can now critically analyze what many politicians, journalists, or pundits say about economic policy and where they get it wrong and where they get it right.","If you want to get a solid foundation in economics or simply want to explore the field, take Ec 10. It will challenge you in terms of the exams and the problem sets, but you'll come out each semester knowing a lot about the world of economics. The lecture series is also a great component of the course, so make sure to actually go to those. Also use the course website to your advantage. Read the helpful hints, do the readings, and also do the practice sets that David Johnson posts before the exams. All of these will help you get a good grade in the course. I also recommend taking the unit tests to not only help boost your grade, but they'll give you great preparation for the exams.","Take this course even if you're not interested in it at all since it is very useful in life.","only take it if you really have to. whatever requirements you have to fulfill can be done another\/better way.","get a good section leader! not necessarily the head, but one who's teaching you can relate to","Take it!!!","Figure out which tf is the best and try to get that tf...","Huge range of students taking this class, from AP ec students in high school to kids with no prior experience in economics.","This class is relevant and informative. Everybody can benefit from a basic knowledge of economics, and I actually enjoyed the course so much that I am thinking about concentrating in economics because of the course. Though it can be challenging, the information and the opportunity to hear such amazing lecturers is worth it!","*sigh* in the end you'll be glad to have studied it but it's just soooo evillll.  everything about it!","This is an enjoyable class if you are interested in economics even in a cursory way.  Be sure to put adequate time into the problem sets, they can hurt you if you neglect them.","This class was just not good.","Requires a lot of work but is very enriching and a great introduction to economics.","Make sure you know and revise sem.1 further over Christmas. There is a LOT of content.","All depends on your TF and how much time you put into it.","The grading in this class is very unfair. The class is easy, though.","Do not be afraid to take this class even if you have never learned any type of economics; taking Ec10 was a rewarding experience.","DO THE READING. READ THE HELPFUL HINTS. TAKE THE UNIT TESTS.","Go to David johnson's office hours (or whoever the head TF is).  He writes the exams - whatever's important to him will end up on the test. And he presents the information in an engaging, comprehensive way.","Your experience in this class is completely dependent upon your luck of the draw with section. If you have a tf whose teaching style is incompatible with your learning style, I would recommend that you switch immediately because that TF will teach you for both macro and micro.","You will cover a lot","This class is all about what you want to put into and get out of it.  If you utilize the unit tests and your TF (or get Head TF David Johnson - he's amazing!) you can really learn a lot of useful information that will help you make sense of the economic situation in the world today.  The problem sets require a lot of thought, and the exams can be tough, but this class gives you a chance to work with peers in a helpful way, master interesting material, and understand a bit of the past and present of US economics.  I liked macro much more than micro, and am definitely glad I took this course.  It's really rewarding to complete the whole year, as well!","Your TF really matters for this class. Make sure you get a good one.","Though most of the material is straight from the textbook, much of your enjoyment of and engagement in the class depends on the talents of your section leader.","Everyone should take at least an introductory course in Economics. It's pretty crucial to understanding the modern world. Since my economics class in highschool was pretty standard, I learned a lot of really valuable information from this class. As long as you don't mind a figurehead professor, as long as you get a decent TF,and as long as you haven't taken micro and macro before, you can really get a lot out of this class.","Make sure you understand the material REALLY well before you take an exam","Go to David Johnson's exam reviews. Seriously - best part of the course. Also, do the Unit Tests.","Econ is useful, but you could probably learn everything useful in THIS course by using Wikipedia. I would definitely try to find another way to learn economics, though, since it is extremely practical.","Definitely not a walk in the park, but a very good introduction to macroeconomic theory.","This is not only one of the better taught and better organized intro classes at Harvard, but it is also one of the classes, regardless of your concentration, that you probably will find to be extremely useful, as it applies to everyday events affecting our own lives.","The infamous Harvard class. Definitely doable, not too bad of a workload, but tough exams. Be sure to find a good TF!","Make sure you get a good TF.  Be vigilant when you first get sectioned.","Very mediocre and mildly interesting class.","very difficult exams not based oin material learned but on application questions that are too challenging to do in a timed setting having never seen them before. section was not helpful. but the course teaches you a lot about econ. Marks will suffer no matter how smart you are","Good course, better if you know people in the class (which is almost a given considering the size) to work in problem sets with.  Sections and lectures can be boring, but the book and helpful hints on the course website are always there as a backup.  Unit Tests are supposed to be optional, but the way the grading system works makes them almost obligatory.","A good class to take","The material is great and relevant but the problem sets and grading is brutal. Also, change your tf if you don't like him\/her.","You should probably take this class if you want to do econ to make sure you actually want to do econ.","Not bad class its not amazing but its solid. Exams are tough but there is a curve. Really depends on if you get a good tf or not.","Good material, annoying class.","Make sure to do the readings. It's a good introduction to economics but it's not a great course. I don't know if you really learn a lot from Mankiew's lectures.","Take this class.  It is frustrating and annoying at times, but absolutely vital to understanding current events and living.","You'll probably have to take this class if you're social science oriented.  It will be incredibly useful, but also arduous.","Great class, it requires a bit of work, so be prepared to work hard!","Ec10 is a great class that's challenging, but nothing ridiculous. You are given many opportunities to show what you know, and I feel that the assignments actually foster more learning as opposed to being too difficult to understand. You learn a considerable amount over the entire year of the course, and it's a class you shouldn't miss out on, unless you are totally against math classes.","There are much easier ways to fulfill a GenEd, and easier ways to get an intro to econ if you don't want to concentrate in it! (See empirical and mathematical reasoning in the gen ed catalog.) If you do sign up for it, go to David Johnson's reviews and take the unit tests! Know lectures and grey boxes in the textbook for midterms - make them free points to offset stuff you don't know.","Macro is more confusing than micro. Make sure to pay attention in section and read the helpful hints carefully, because there is a fair amount of material that is not included in the textbook.","Get used to it. You're going to have major issues with it, but just be known that Economics at Harvard doesn't necessarily have to be like Ec10. You can't really change how Ec10 is taught. =","Look at the Helpful Hints and do all the readings and psets! Also, read the book before your section classes!!!","It's a lot of work and you'll have to really take initiative to do well, but otherwise, if you get a good TF, it's an interesting class that definitely applies to what you see happening in the real world. It's very useful, especially macroeconomics in the second semester.","It is a course with great subject matter that will allow you to better understand today's financial issues and the guest lectures are a great exposure to different areas of economics!","Its good but doing well in it requires not only knowing economics but knowing how to take Ec 10 well - which is an entire skill unto itself.","Something you must take while at Harvard.","Unless you plan to concentrate in economics, I would be very wary to take this \"classic Harvard course.\" The pedagogy and the exams are not unified, and the sectioning of the course makes it difficult to sift through the bureaucracy. Your experience in this course will be determined by the TF you are assigned.","It's your basic introductory economics class. A few bells and whistles (renowned guest lecturers) but pretty much standard stuff. Get a good TF and you're set. If you want to concentrate in ec, you have to take it. If you're interested in any social science, Ec 10 is definitely related to all of them and will help you understand them. Not really recommended otherwise though--there are shorter gen eds to take.","If you're good at math, this is going to be easy.","Material is interesting but not taught very well. Your experience will depend on whether your TF is good or not.","Material is important and interesting and David Johnson is a demi-god, but problem sets are often not related to what is taught. Good intro to Economics, but don't take it because of Professor Mankiw. He's not around much.","After the first midterm, you will understand better how to prepare for the one-hour exams.","It's worth the amount of work and stress you will put into it.","Your experience can vary greatly depending on your section leader. While it is hard to request to be placed in a particular TF's section, take advantage of the range of teaching staff and be proactive in searching out a TF that you can learn from in office hours at the very least.","Teaches you all the basics of economics","Macroeconomics is a really fascinating course that is much more relevant to real-world events than micro.  The course materials are all really good to use, and the explanations to all of the problem set and exam answers online are really well thought-out and thorough.\r\nDefinitely make the effort to keep up with the readings, unit tests, and homeworks, because these are the best way to learn.  Also go to office hours!","This course teaches you how to think like an economist. Insight, I feel, is the most important attribute that can be attained from this course.","Anyone who hasn't taken an economics course should take this course.","Must take class if you ever want to make sense of more than half the things going on in the economic\/political world. Difficult at times, but the work is EXTREMELY worth it. I took so much away from the course so that if I were to be plopped into Wallstreet, I would know how to answer a couple questions.","If you need it, suck it up and take it.  You can probably get by with minimal effort.  If not, don't.  There are better ways to learn econ.","This is a great course if you want to learn about economics. I consider it a must-take because the material you cover in this course is going to be relevant in life no matter what you end up majoring in.","Whether or not the logistics of the course are preferable, the material is so relevant and so important that I recommend that everyone take this course. It's not an overwhelming amount of work, it is consistent and predictable, and what you learn is so important no matter what you become. The sections are really hit or miss, and I hit, which might affect the legitimacy of my recommendation, but I think it's worth it even if you sleep through every section and just read the whole textbook instead.","It's not terrible, but it's not that great.  Take it if you think you might want to concentrate within this department, but don't take it just to fulfill a GenEd.","In my opinion your experience greatly differs depending on your TF.","If you want to learn basic economics, this is the course. If you plan on concentrating in Ec, or think you might, this is the course. Don't be fooled by the shopping week lectures - this course is taught in sections. Thankfully most of the TFs are good. All in all, a good intro to the Econ concentration: If you sit there passively, you will get a good education, be lost in a sea of Econ people, and never meet any professors or TFs. And if you reach out to Mankiw, David Johnson, and your TF, you'll probably get a better education, along with actually developing a relationship with your professor.","Ec10 can be a really amazing class if you have a good TF, but if you don't it can be one of the most painful experiences ever (I know because I switched TFs between semesters and I didn't realize how fun the class can actually be when you have a teacher who cares about his students).","No matter what you're going to concentrate in, take Ec 10.  I can't imagine myself not knowing all the things I have learned in this class.","Good to know the basics, but a real pain of a class","Relatively easy class if you are a quantitative person, but still very interesting material.  At first I was upset that Mankiw barely teaches, but if you have a good section leader, section can be amazing.  In some ways, my ideal class--problem set based & quantitative, but easy with relevant material.  I love that I can now understand WSJ articles.","Ec10 is one of those classes that you usually end up taking because you have to. I took it as a junior, and can guarantee that, in comparison to the other \"big intro classes\" that you need to take, Ec10 ranks pretty highly.","It's not the most exciting class, but it's not difficult. Don't expect to feel engaged very often.","Read the textbook & helpful hints. Go to office hours. Do the readings--they suck, but if it's on the test you either know it or you don't.  The other stuff you'll be able to sort of BS or figure out, but the readings should be easy points.  Pray that you get a good TF--it makes all the difference.","very useful introduction to the field of economics and useful even for non-concentrators","Make sure to get a good TF- it could make a world of a difference.","On First Looking into the Realm of Economics\r\n\r\nMuch have I travell'd on the yellow brick road,\r\nAnd many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\r\nRound many western islands have I been\r\nWhich bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\r\nOft of one wide expanse had I been told\r\nThat deep-browed Adam Smith ruled as his demesne; \r\nYet did I never breathe its pure serene\r\nTill I heard Keynes speak out loud and bold:\r\nThen felt I like some watcher of the skies\r\nWhen a new planet swims into his ken;\r\nOr like Mankiw when with eagle eyes\r\nHe star'd at the Yard \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and all his men\r\nLook'd at each other with a wild surmise \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\r\nSilent, upon a peak in Annenberg.\r\n\r\nPhil Keats Yao, A Disciple of Darlie Chavis\r\n(You should take this course)","good topic to know about","The world makes sense after taking the course! I took it totally as an elective and think it will be very useful and relevant to whatever I do.","It is definitely a lot of work and on a tough curve, but it is a great class to take.","By the time you finish Ec10b, you will be pretty burned out on introductory economics at Harvard.  That being said, Ec10b is similar to Ec10a in everything but content.  If you like\/were able to tolerate Ec10a you will be fine in Ec10b.","Everybody should know something about basic economics.","If you are genuinely interested in economics, this class may be worth taking. It can be a little impersonal at times (enormous lectures and large sections), so be warned.","The exams are HARD, and the p-sets take a lot of work! The course material is super relevant, though, and there isn't all that much work week per week. Get ready to \"synthesize\"--this is not a course in which you're asked to spit back material.","This course was good a intro to economics. Lectures were usually good, but sections depend on your TF. However, the courses' materials (textbook, website) greatly supplement section and help you learn the material regardless.","Take it together with a friend. Good to learn to material, but class is a lot of work, time consuming, and often frustrating.","Like all huge lecture classes, there's that personal interaction with that you just can't replicate (Why does Harvard keep deluding itself?). A good introduction to economics if you have a good TF.","very dependent on your section leader. make sure you get a good one","If you like econ, Ec10 is a great class. I came into this class knowing nothing about econ, and now coming out, I want to be an econ major. This class definitely gives you all the basic tools you need, and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants a basic understanding of how society works.\r\n\r\nThere are two warnings I would give you. First, the problem sets and exams aren't easy. Second, this course is highly dependent on the quality of your TF. Almost all the material is taught in section, so if you get a bad TF, this will be a miserable class for you. If you get a great TF, you'll love it!","This is a difficult course, however it provides vital information that facilitates the comprehension of what is going on around the world right now.","really good intro to ec. but you have to know that you are getting yourself into a huge class that can often feel like an impersonal machine. my tf was great, and that made a huge difference. definitely go to david johnson's review sessions because he is the MAN.","Do the unit tests and extra problem sets.","Just not super engaging. You learn a decent amount for sure. Its not too challenging. Yet, the class just seems like such a machine.","While some might not find it enjoyable, this class helps make students more informed about the way our society runs, and would help them make better decisions, be they economic or political.","The lectures are hit or miss. Some are very interesting and worthwhile, and others are dry and not particularly interesting. Although much of the course seems trivial since it cannot be applied to real life, the material at least gives you a framework of economics and helps you understand current events.","Liberal or Conservative, Capitalist or Communist, everyone should take an introductory economics class in order to be an informed citizen of the Industrialized world.  Also, go to Prof. Mankiw's office hours!  He may not give that many lectures because the class is best taught in section, but he's great to talk to in person and cares about Ec 10 students!","This course is the worst at Harvard.  You can't hear Mankiw's lectures.  The guest lecturers are irrelevant and normally have no real relevance, except for obscure facts that will show up on midterms.  The course is designed to mess you up and weed out the Ec concentrators from everyone else.  Except those students have already taken Ec.  Probably the Ec AP in high school.  I really disliked this course and don't recommend it at all.","The material of the class is something you have to expose yourself to sometime. However, the class as implemented is hit-or-miss, based on what TF you get.","Truly one of the greatest classes at Harvard. You will apply the things you learn here to nearly every other class you take. You walk away with a powerful knowledge of economics and the ability to argue smarter. Workload isn't bad and tests are curved to raise grades substantially.","This is really the only class I've ever taken at Harvard in which the old Harvard stereotype about the TF's, not the professor, teaching the class is really true. The TF's are primarily responsible for teaching the material, so if you end up with a bad TF, it can be a rough year (fortunately I didn't.)","EC 10 teaches material which is incredibly relevant, interesting and useful, and it teaches this information quite well.  Unfortunately, it is also a very big course, which means that a lot of your success will depend on the quality of teaching fellow you get, and you may get a bit lost in the process.  Personally, I am disappointed with the feedback on assignments, and the apparent disconnect between what is taught and what is tested; however, I am still happy that I took the course because I have learned a great deal.","Ec 10 is a great course to give you an understanding of economics that is helpful for all of life in the future. Macro is easier than micro and the workload isn't too bad at all.","Section is worthless. Just read the textbook and helpful hints, do the psets, and do the practice exams before the exams.","Ec 10 does a great job of introducing students to the most fundamental concepts of Economics. I feel comfortable talking to an Economist about basic economic concepts now.","Pay attention in section and in lectures. The material is not too challenging. Be sure to always do your problem sets. It helps so much with understanding the material.","Great class for building an economic intuition","Much better than micro.","This course is underrated.  Your first year of economics is the most important, because unless you are going very deeply into it (graduate work), you get most of what you need in the first year.","it requires a lot of time and effort, but if you do all of the problem sets and unit tests, you will do relatively well in the class","Just get through it and make sure to do all of the little things - take unit tests, go to office hours, etc. - if you want to get an A.","Ec10 is a pill you just have to swallow. It's not a joke class, so try to pay somewhat attention. If you have a bad TF, switch out while you can. The quality of your education is largely dependent on how well your TF explains things. Your midterms are then graded against other sections, some of whom have TFs who make study guides for them. If your TF isn't that nice, sucks for you.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a large intro class with a famous professor \"teaching\" on it. Not my favorite class, but something you just have to get through.","It is essential to your life knowledge","Tell them be ready for the tests. Everything else is overrated. Nothing is intuitive","Ec 10 teaches you a lot. It's not as tough as its sometime thought, but you do cover a lot of material. It's good knowledge to have and I feel I can have a much for informed debate about the economy after the course.","If your TF isn't good, this class may be difficult. Make sure you seek out a TF that you can understand and get help if you don't understand the material.","This class is huge; the course directors structure tests around a curve and not around whether or not students understand the material.  With that being said, it's not terribly difficult.  If you can live with that then by all means take the course.","I did not enjoy this course whatsoever. There are too many variants between sections, and it is luck as to whether you get a good section or not.","its great to learn economics, but i definitely have my reservations which i will not share here.","Full of useful information, pretty difficult in terms of how much material there is.","I appreciated the fact that this course helped me develop a better understanding of how the macroeconomy functions, why the financial crisis occurred, and how the government manipulates the economy.  However, the structure of this course discouraged me from concentrating in economics.  The lectures were very large and impersonal and the crux of the course was taught by a TF.","DO the readings, both chapter and articles, they make the course so much easier","Taking this class is a bit of a gamble.  It is definitely worth it, if only for the basic insight into the world of economics, but there is a decent chance you'll have a worthless section and have to learn everything from the textbook.","You get out of Ec 10 what you put into it. Go to office hours, read the news paper, be engaged.","It's an experience I find hard to separate from freshman year at Harvard.","The material you learn in this class is very relevant and really you should know the basics of economics.  but it is an absolute struggle especially if you do not get a good TF since you have the same one all year. Basically this class is a gamble and can hurt your GPA but you do come out of it with a greater knowledge of whats going on in the American and world economy right now.","Your experience in this class is determined by your section leader. Get a good one, and this class can be fund for anyone. Get a bad section leader, and this class can be painful.","You have to take Ec10 to get anywhere in economics.  It's not going to blow your mind but it offers a passable introduction to economics.","1.) This course is not easy; you get out what you put into it. If you put in a lot of effort, you will learn a TON. I know that doesn't sound helpful -- but seriously, you take Ec-10 to learn about how the world works. If you're just taking it for a Gen-Ed, look elsewhere.\r\n2.) In terms of time commitment -- if you didn't take AP Econ in high school (and I did not), you will probably find yourself going to office hours a lot in the beginning. So outside of 3 hrs of class per week, plus some psets which take several hours, plus reading the textbook\/articles, plus Googling stuff you don't understand (do it!), you can already be at over 10 hours per week of outside work. So, it's a time-consuming course, but you get SO MUCH out of it if you put the time in!\r\n3.) GO SEE DAVID JOHNSON. I can't say it enough. He makes this course.","You're going to want to take this class. You may not always like it, but it's very worthwhile, and all your friends are going to take it, so you might as well. It's a very solid intro into ec that helps you look at the world and better see how and why things work the way they do","It was a great introductory class and it really gave a great foundation for future econ classes, definitely a must-take for Econ students or anyone interested in learning Economics at all.","Overall, this was a helpful course that offered a lot of basic knowledge for those who are being first introduced to the world of economics. With that being said, there definitely can be improvements made. Professor Mankiw makes rare appearances, and sections are lackluster, at best. If you put in the work, you can perform well; however, it would have been a  much more enjoyable learning experience if the content was taught in a more interesting and engaging way. At the end of the day, it really depends on which section leader you get.","It will make you understand what's really going on in the world","A lot of students think Macro is harder than Micro, but for me I liked Macro much better than Micro because it just made more sense to me as it was more applicable to the current economic situation. The course is hard if you're not used to math and science problems, but to remedy this I highly recommend reading the textbook beforehand and taking notes. I did this for the second semester, so when I went to section the material was a reiteration of what I had already read. This made it much easier and concepts actually stuck in my head so the tests were also a lot easier. Also, then I could focus on asking questions on things that didn't make sense to me and problem sets became a lot easier.","Look for a good TF if not you will surely dislike the class. Dislike is an euphemism for the word that I really wish to use.","A very good and thorough course to challenge yourself in understanding completely what is happening in world economics","Teaches you the right way to think","Take if you like to be given theories without proof backed by intuition.","TAKE THIS CLASS IT WILL MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY PARTICULARLY MACRO AND PARTICULARLY WITH DAVID JOHNSON AS HEAD TF. PROBLEM SETS ARE ANNOYING BUT HELP A LOT. YES IT IS A BIG CLASS WITH TFS BUT THE TFS USUALLY ARE PRETTY GOOD.","If you're not a quantitative person, be prepared to have to \"work\" in this course to understand what is going on. DJ's Psets are kind of silly sometimes, and I found his  review sessions unhelpful generally.","If Harvard required students to take specific courses, this should make the list. It sounds cliche, but taking a basic economics course will change the way you look at the world.","You should take this class, but it's not fun. It is essential learning though,","Every student should take this class before they graduate.","The material Ec10 teaches is incredibly important--everyone should know something about the economy because you can't escape it! I had a fantastic year in Ec10 because I had an incredible TF (Holger Wilms)--make sure you get a good TF and you'll really enjoy the class. No, Mankiw doesn't teach often (although he is a pretty good lecturer when he does teach), and yes, there are 800 kids in the class, but it's worth it. Not too difficult, either!","This is a good class to learn the basics of economics through.  It is kind of slow and the problem sets get annoying, but it is not badly taught and not a big time commitment at all.","This class is a good basic coverage of micro and macro economics. However, if you're not great at math, be prepared to work harder. The course moves quickly, so go to office hours. The problem sets are difficult as are the midterms and finals. Reading the book is so helpful, so don't blow it off!","It teaches you how to think globally. It allows you to understand the reasons why fiscal and monetary policies are so delicate in politics.","It is helpful if you can do readings before section, otherwise section can be a waste of time","It is hard, but rewarding.","Don't let the size of the class overwhelm you.   There are plenty of opportunities to meet with Prof. Mankiw and David Johnson during office hours; make the most of these.","don't fall behind or else you'll get more and more confused","It is a good course.","This class is what anyone criticizing Harvard would hold up as their prime example of the problems with a large research institution. A hot-shot professor who doesn't teach, reliance on graduate students who may have a poor command on English, and a huge mass of students graded on a curve. That being said, I think learning economics is very important for anyone's understanding of the world, and one should take this course if only to be better informed about politics\/economics.","Take Ec-10. It's basic economic knowledge that everyone should know, and it gives you a solid grasp on principles that will be useful to you for the rest of your life.","Gives you a solid grounding in economics if you work hard on problem sets, read the books, go to David Johnson's office hours\/review sessions, and have a decent section leader.","It's a GPA killer, but you actually learn really relevant and interesting material in the Spring Semester.","Ec10 is an introductory class--if you have any background at all, try to place into 1010 or, even better, 1011.","The information is useful and I think everyone should take an intro level economics course at some point during their time here. However, if you take this class for a letter grade, you will need to put in a lot of time if you want to do well. Otherwise, I'd recommend taking it pass\/fail if you just want to learn the material.","the grading scale in ec 10 is very rigid. Be aware of that. Don't miss any of the unit tests. The exams are significantly more difficult than the class would initially have you believe.","Unless you want to be an ec concentrator, take another intro to ec class.  You want to learn a little about both macro and micro, but devoting a full year to it is too much especially if it is not required.","It's a good coarse and I do recommend it.  The teaching, however, is not very good.  The materials, the subject, and the (once every blue moon) lectures are great.  But you have to do most of the grunt work (learning the graphs) on your own.","Try to get in David Johnson's section.  He is a great teacher.  Also make sure to read the book content before the material is covered in section.  The \"helpful hints\" on the website are a lifesaver.","Ec 10 is a course definitely worth taking, I think it's something that everybody should know if only to better understand the news. Especially  second semester, since though I liked microeconomics more, I think that macro was what did the best job of clarifying some of the muddier issues being discussed with regards to the US and world economies. Be aware that this is a BIG CLASS, you will feel like a number and have to work very hard to get any help or attention, even from your section leader.","This course is mandatory if you want to have a broad understanding of how the economy works. This is important whether or not you are concentrating in economics or not. The midterms and exams are really difficult because they are all problem solving questions that really test your innate problem solving skills rather than what is in the textbook.","It is a solid class.  A building block for economics.","Good course to take","I wouldn't take this course unless you had to.","Ec 10 is a Harvard institution - as a student in the course, you're participating in something that tens of thousands of students past, present, and future are a part of, and that's a neat feeling.","Stay strong and get it done. Don't drop out midway! And make a friend group to do psets in you won't regret it. And do unit tests they aren't very difficult and graded more than fairly","The course felt like it went on forever. Macro was more interesting. Make sure you keep up with the work and understand the material as you go, because it's easy to fall behind. Definitely worth taking just to understand the global economy better.","Take Ec 10.  Your peers may gripe while they are in it, you may gripe while you're in it, but, in the end, you will all have gathered a great working knowledge of economics that will help you in other coursework and in life.  We are not born knowing about supply, demand, interest rates, and inflation, but they are not difficult to understand (at least on their most basic levels)--it only takes a good intro like Ec 10.","It sucks.","Unless you are seriously considering concentrating in Economics, do not take this course.","Do the readings, they're easy and helpful. Sections can not be very helpful, especially if you get a bad TF, so be prepared to do a lot of the work on your own through readings and helpful hints. Definitely still take this course, basic economics is essential to basically every field.","Economics is essential for all students.  The course is well structured and section is well taught.","The tests are very difficult. Not a very fulfilling course for me personally, but perhaps for people who have a strong Ec background they would find it good.","Must-take.","Worth taking although micro is more interesting.","Lots of work but all good stuff you should know about basic economics.","It's pretty boring and no one really enjoys the class.","Lots of work, but you learn a lot.","Useful information. Worth taking if you are interested in social sciences.","The course is not difficult if you go to section and do the textbook reading before the exams.","economics is important, that's the only good thing i have to say about this class","The class can be hard! You have to be interested to put in the time to \"beat\" the curve.","This course exposed me to economics, and allowed me to learn basic concepts useful in day to day life.","Do as many unit tests as possible and don't fall behind in section","Take it if you are interested in econ. Not very hard.","Take advantage of the lectures because many famous economists speak and talk about very current and relevant topics, effectively relating the course to real life.","It is a tough course.","Take it if you need to, otherwise it might not be worth it.","Take a harder economics class if possible.","Good experience but not very well managed course. David Johnson should be the true leader of the course, not Mankiw","Good to know the basics about the economy. But I would not recommend unless pursuing economics later on.","It's a useful course, but be ready to teach yourself everything.","I would tell future students that this class is a good introduction to basic economic concepts and theories, but it is also a great way to figure out if you really want to continue studying economics.  Although the instruction received by students can vary greatly, the basic material does give students a taste for the concepts they will encounter in other upper level economics courses.","It is pretty challenging and time consuming but the knowledge you will gain is exremely valuable.","Look, you have to take it if you want to concentrate in Ec or do a secondary in it, so you don't have a choice. The class isn't that great, PSETs are often annoying, the midterms test much more your writing speed and multiple choice ability than any EC knowledge, lectures don't happen very often and are sometimes uninteresting, other times they rock (Larry Summers gave us a presentation on the financial crisis and I loved it). So yeah I mean all I have to say is good luck, you will survive, forget about Ec 10 and not really think about it after you're done. The head TF, Mr. Johnson, is actually the real professor of the class, and he does really good review sessions. Prof Mankiw is really just there for show and do like 4-5 lectures a year.","Ec10 is definitely the most useful class I have taken at Harvard, in terms of applicability. I now feel like I can read any article in the New York Times and truly understand the economic concepts that are discussed. Not the most exciting class, but definitely worth taking.","The class is part of the Harvard experience.  You're learning about the principles that are the basis of all financial transactions with 800 other people, and it's a great feeling.","Form close bonds with your classmates, so that you can collaborate\/commiserate when the going gets tough. Section TFs come in varying qualities of teaching; don't be afraid to go to David Johnson's helpful office hours and ask for help when you need it.","This is a great class to take, especially if you're a freshman and still figuring out what you would like to do (concentration-wise). Don't worry that it is large - it is taught predominantly in section. Guest lecturers are great. The class is not particularly hard, although it can get difficult at times.","Ec 10 isn't the most engaging class ever, but it's enlightening. Learning about economics gives you a different world view; if you're not going to learn it on your own, learn it here.","It's pretty useful and gives you a good foundation in economics. David Johnson is sort of crazy and obsessed with SYNTHESIS but he puts together a challenging and at times entertaining course. Make sure you go to section; there are entire portions of the course not in the textbook and section can be really helpful.","Are you really interested in economics? Take it. If not, don't as you may find it to be a little more than you intended.","This class provides a solid introduction to basic economic principles. It will help you understand economic policy in the US, and only in the US. It will certainly help you understand the current economic debate and the teaching staff makes an effort to focus on current issues as much as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course teaches economics from one perspective only - that is, from a right-wing perspective. Government intervention is generally presented as something bad, as are higher taxes and most kinds of state-run programs. Be aware of this when you enter the course and do not let yourself be led astray by these biased claims. Do not expect classes to support debate of any kind. Your TF will be hit or miss, so make sure to find out which ones are 'hits' in the beginning and attend their office hours.","shop TFs","I would tell them to be cautious about the level of work and grading system","If you are not that interested in economics, take it pass\/fail. But it's definitely interesting and it teaches you useful stuff.","This is a great class. Concepts require you to use common sense instead of trying to memorizing a bunch of facts. Just think how to make the most money and you will be fine.","This is a must take. Taking this class will enable you to understand broad economic concepts discussed every day in the newspaper, etc.","This class is crucial for your understanding of how the world works. You need to learn this material so unless you plan on reading the book on your own or taking an Intro Ec course over a summer somewhere else, you need to take this class. It enriches your understanding of the rest of your studies. That said, this class can be very unorganized and it ALL DEPENDS ON THE TF. My first semester, I had a TF who was really nice just not the best teacher for me. So first semester was rough but 2nd semester, my TF was a BOSS. He was the coolest dude ever and he was super smart. He was super helpful and I actually enjoyed Ec10 with him. (minus the problem sets lol) To sum up- Great material that every college student should be exposed to but you're going to have to put in mad work.","It's a really good intro economics course, and it's worth taking just to get a strong background in the subject even if you don't plan further work. It's as good as a large introductory lecture course could be.","This is the type of course that you should take, that will be helpful down the road, and teach you basic economics that you can apply in the real world. However, at the same time, it is a course that you either love or hate, and your experience is mostly attributable to your teaching fellow. Also, exams are frustrating because oftentimes you feel that you are unable to demonstrate all that you know and that you have learned in an hour long exam.","a course that everyone should take","As long as you do the problem sets yourself you will get a lot out of this course and also do well in it.","This class is extremely difficult but necessary in order to be a more aware person.","Solid teaching and very useful knowledge"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is an awesome class if you want a thorough introduction to economics as a prospective concentrator or otherwise. The weekly problem sets are not too much trouble if you work with others and start them sooner than the night before. The textbook is extremely helpful and section reiterates much of what is taught in the chapters (most likely why section is \"optional\".) Mankiw and the guest lecturers do a nice job of applying concepts taught in the course to contemporary issues.","It changes the way you think.","This is one of those courses that most students take, but for a reason. Many need it to fulfill a concentration requirement, while others use it as a Gen Ed. Even though it is an intro class, you will be challenged. That being said, if you put your work into the class so that you understand the concepts, you should be fine. The unit tests are a great way to gauge your understanding of materials AND you get extra points for passing them. The problem sets are time consuming, but since so many people are in the class, it is easy to find people to work with when you get stuck.","It's a good intro class to economics but not really a good barometer for determining if you want to concentrate in economics.","I truly enjoyed this course, but I expect that has more to do with an inner excitement for economics than an outer proficiency in it being taught.  If you think you might want to learn more about economics, definitely take this course.  If you know you don't enjoy the field, this course will be livable but not pleasant.","Okay class. Materials are not that well organized, so things you learn in sections and through the book might be pretty unclear.","It's not as bad as everyone tells you it is.","Good class, but don't expect it to be super easy.","It is a lot of work. be prepared to struggle.","Take this class! The material is not difficult, but you learn a lot if you put the time and effort. It is also a great way to meet other freshmen or simply interact with the wonderful teaching staff. Lectures are not dull and sections (at least my section with Vladimir) are wonderful. Take this class!","Do the unit tests.","I definitely would recommend it as I believe economics is an important field but it is very difficult and the exams and problem sets are unfair.","This is a super hard class especially if you are not exactly math or graphs - minded, in which case you will likely find yourself feeling frustrated and lost much of the time. But that being said I also think it is an incredibly valuable class and I know I will be glad to have learned the material I did understand - definitely worth struggling through if you have any interest in understanding how the world actually works.","This class is time-consuming but I think it really does teach you useful, relevant information about how individuals, firms, and countries make decisions in the domestic and world economy that all Harvard students should know.","Don't take this class because everyone else is taking it, or because it's taught by Mankiw. Mankiw barely teaches, and it's not a social class. Take it if you're interested in the material or you want to concentrate in ec. Even then, if you have ec background, consider taking ec1010a instead. Also, go to David Johnson's office hours. He's great!! Also, do the readings. No really. DO THEM.","not the most interesting or exciting class ever, but gives you knowledge about economics that I think every person should know","The class doesn't cover the most interesting material, but it does help you understand the way economists think about the world.  Very useful if you're planning on pursuing work in the social sciences.","Sections are awful. All you can do is pray for a good TF","It takes willingness to seek out help from peers and TFs during office hours. P-sets will take at least 4-6 hours depending on whether or not you know the material. Get a friend to keep you on track and to work on p-sets together. You can work out the kinks or you can look to your TF. Every part of this course is very important.","It is not stimulating, but it is a subject I think everyone should have a basic background in. The course is the largest course at the school not because it is good, but because the subject is useful to understand.","If you don't really like econ and don't want to continue in it don't take this course. It's miserable. I hated it. If you don't have a good TF (which is very likely), it's a million times worse. Don't risk it.","Get a good TF. If you don't, you'll have an awful semester.","You'll hear a whole range of comments about Ec 10... most of them will be negative. Truth is, Ec 10 is what you make of it. It can be completely unhelpful and unenlightening if you don't spend the time on it, but it can CHANGE YOUR LIFE if you do spend the time to THINK about the concepts. You learn SO MUCH about the world, if only you'll let Ec 10 teach you. Is the course taught almost exclusively in section? Yes. Does your TF's quality matter for this course? Absolutely. But he\/she may matter less than you might think. The course's material is really in the book, problem sets, and helpful hints. With those materials, you are well on your way to learning everything in Ec 10 without your TF. Having a good TF is helpful, but if you don't, it's not the end of the world. So the moral of the story? If you are interested in Economics, want to learn what it's about, or just want to know more about the world around you, want to understand those televised political debates or recent public policies--this is the class for you. TAKE IT. :)","It will be easier if you have previous exposure to economics, but also that it's probably good to have some knowledge of economics before entering the real world so it's probably worth taking for that reason","It is analytical and problem-solving oriented.","It's not the most fun class you can take unless you really really like economics, but I think that practically, it's really good. It's also interesting to see the real life situations you hear about every day in a new, analyzed context.","This class moves extremely quickly, which makes it difficult to keep up, especially for those with no economics background. Also, problem sets often seem to go very well beyond what we learn both in the textbook as well as in section.","I know that a lot of people complain about Professor Mankiw and Ec 10, but the fact is that it is the best beginning economics course it could possibly be.  The TF can really make or break your experience, but lectures (and guest lectures) are always interesting and informative, because they relate what you're learning to the real world.","If you have a strong quantitative background, Ec 10 really isn't that difficult.  Everyone should take a course in economics during college, and Ec 10 does a good job of teaching what you need to know to be a well-educated citizen of the world.","This class, even if you are not concentrating in Ec, is a wonderful one to take at Harvard. You won't find many others like it. Not only are you taught by one of the best professors at Harvard, but also, you learn practical material that you will use essentially for the rest of your life. This class is COMPLETELY worth it, despite your political opinions.","It's quite a work, but it's a good class to take.","It's helpful for learning the basics of economics.  I think its a good course for everyone to take, and it teaches you to look at the world from a different perspective.  That said, don't expect to come out of the course with a deep understanding of economics. It's an Intro class.  The works not horrible, and there are a lot of opportunities to improve your grade, so that's nice too.","It's a big time commitment, but a very rewarding class.","Microeconomics can be somewhat dry, but the concepts learned are practical and important in understanding markets and trends in the world.","Ec 10 is an absolutely necessary course to take with information that will be useful for the rest of your life.  Do the reading and psets on your own, and you should be completely fine for midterms and finals.  Best of luck!","The course is literally almost always taught in section; I'm not sure if all the other TFs are, but mine is just a graduate student. And in the end, you'll really end up teaching yourself everything from the textbook and Helpful Hints (!) rather than from a professor or TF.","Read the helpful hints. They are, well, more helpful than the textbook is going to be especially for the problem sets. Go to David Johnson's review sessions! They are amazing and relate the concepts in class to policy, like the Simpson-Bowles debt plan and other debates. They are by far the most exciting and inspirational part of the course so far. It is hard to understand Prof Mankiw from the balcony, so I recommend sitting downstairs in Sanders.","It really helps to stay on top of your psets and not start them the night before they're due.  Also, do the unit tests because they help solidify the information before you have to take an exam onit.","be prepared to struggle at first","This class is intermittently interesting, but most of the problem sets are quite tedious.","Huge course. Decent lectures. Section can be good or miserable depending on who you have. Take it early and get it over with.","Be careful about buying into everything you're told. The class tries to seem like it's telling objective truth and doesn't like to admit that it's making assumptions.","Be prepared for super specific questions on the midterms\/final exams. Specific as in - referencing brief instances in the text books that might not have a meaning that is...\"applicable\" to the general purpose of the course but are just \"checks\" to make sure that you read.","This class teaches basic skills necessary to understand economic principles and theories.  It is a great overview course, but do not expect one on one attention.  It requires self-motivation to keep up with the textbook reading.","It's good but not great...I felt like information came at a steady but not overwhelming pace...on the other hand I felt like I walked out of very few lectures\/sections feeling like I had an idea to really work on or think about","Not the greatest class you'll take at Harvard but pretty good at explaining the basics of economics, which are surprisingly applicable in real life. I look at the world a little differently now. Lecture's aren't great and Pset's are annoying but tests aren't that bad and there are plenty of ways to learn the material.","Basic economics, but quite complex analysis.  Applications may be difficult for beginners.","Economics 10 is without doubt a worthwhile course because it can enhance one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of the world. For instance, this course has definitely increased my knowledge of policy debates. As a result of my experience in Ec 10, I can now talk intelligently about subjects as diverse as the economics of poverty, taxes, interest rates, pollution control, and the minimum wage. However, some aspects of Ec 10 are not ideal. For instance, Professor Mankiw only lectures a few times throughout the semester, which means that the course is taught almost exclusively in section. The quality of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience in the class therefore depends on the TF. Additionally, there are several guest lectures throughout the course of the term that tend to be rather dry. In terms of exam preparation, the teaching staff provides ample study materials and schedules review sessions. Unfortunately, some of the exams test on the minute details of readings and lectures rather than the big picture; consequently, taking detailed notes throughout the semester is crucial.","What you get out of this course depends on how much time and effort you put into it.","This class teaches material that is important to know for life, but can get dry and tedious at times","This class is tough but it is necessary. If you put the effort in you will really learn a lot.","very important knowledge yet very time consuming and difficult","It can be boring, but it is worth taking.","From discussions with my friends, I found that your experience in this course depends a lot on your section leader. If he or she is competent, speaks English well, has a deep understanding of the material, and cares about his or her student's success, this course will be a great experience. If not... Good luck. Definitely try to switch section leaders if you dislike your first one. You will be with them all year.","If you have any interest in pursuing economics, take this class. A little work is required to understand the concepts, but the workload is manageable.","Its too, too hard. Be ready for a tough one.","This is a very instructive course, however it is difficult.  In order to get a good grade, you must put in a considerable amount of effort, both on your own and with the help of TF's, tutors, and\/or other students.","Do the Problem Sets yourself because they are a great way of preparing for tests","It's a good course if you just want basic knowledge in the field, or if you're new to it and want a good survey course.","This class is taught heavily in section and depends greatly on your TF. This class is a really important class to take before graduating from college, as everyone should have a basic knowledge of economics, but remember that it is incredibly oversimplified and therefore doesn't give you the answers to important policy decisions like taxes, etc... Be sure to take more economics classes before deciding if you are fiscally liberal or conservative.","I really think that if you want to learn economics, you should take this course or a similar basic introduction to microeconomics. Of course it is important to understand different ways to look at the economic system as well (say marxist as opposed to neoclassical) however standard neoclassical economics is an important understanding to have for future work in economics or other disciplines and it is worth devoting a full semester to.","Make sure you get a good section leader. Also, do the pests by yourself, in other words you will not be prepared for your exams. Mankiw is actually really nice and smart, so don't let the liberal bias on the campus scare you from taking this class.","This course is not taught or run well at all, but every Harvard student should come out of college understanding the concepts taught in the course.  So it is necessary even though","Great! David Johnson is great. You really should learn Economics to learn how our capitalist world functions, and this is a great introduction.","This is a decent but not a very good or enjoyable class. Please take what you learn with a grain of salt. While engaged in this course, you should question and challenge the material and read plenty of outside sources, especially if you are considering economics as an undergraduate study or a profession.","Your TF can really determine how much you like\/dislike this course, but regardless, it's a nice class to take since it's information that's just good to know.","Great course that requires work but is very rewarding. David Johnson is the best resource - go to his office hours!! He knows the material backward and forward. Also the best teacher I have ever had","you should only take this course if you're interested in concentrating\/secondaring in economics since it is a prereq for many courses","It's not as hard as everyone makes it seem.","Useful for learning basics of economics. Pretty interesting material, well taught and lots of support available.","This course is essentially necessary to begin a study of economics without having a background in it previously, but it can at times be tedious.","This class isn't that hard, and it also doesn't have much of an ideological slant, as some people would have you believe, so even if you disagree with some of the things that are mentioned, just deal with it.","This is a good class to take because the material is so important, but the quality of the class varies hugely from TF to TF. I was fortunate to have a good TF, but if I didn't I am sure the class would have been much less pleasant.","You won't see the professor very often... But that's okay if you get a good TF. If you get Jelani you will love your life because he is so nice and helpful and approachable. It's a good class to take, just to get general knowledge about how economics works.","This is a good class that gives you an interesting introduction to the economics subject. However, your enjoyment of the class really depends on whether you end up liking the subject and what type of a T.F. you get.","It requires a good deal of application that goes beyond what you learn in the book.","It is useful information regardless of what you concentrate in.","Honestly, I suppose I'm glad I took this course despite my overall lukewarm feelings to it. It admittedly does provide a basic foundation to economics, knowledge that will come in handy in any later profession. It also reaffirmed that I am most definitely not choosing to concentrate in economics.","This is a class that everyone slightly interested in finance or the business world should take","It is useful more than it is engaging.","Unless you reading the textbook, having a good section leader is key.","If you are going to take this course, take it as a freshmen or sophomore, when you are still willing to do high school type of work.","you need to know economics to be a functioning member of society. this class is very accessible and very worthwhile. must take to graduate.","Take this course if you want to know more about econ","pray that you get a good tf. if not you're own your own!","If you get a bad section leader good luck, this course will be terribly difficult for you.","The class is time consuming and doing the problem sets is a drag however the knowledge is very important and not taking economics would leave a large gap in your knowledge making it a class that everyone should take.","Be ready to handle the mind of David Johnson.  Only look to the book for rudimentary understanding of the concepts, but be prepared to extend this understanding with the aid of thought-provoking and somewhat difficult questions.","If you bought the international version of the textbook to save yourself from having to pay a ridiculous amount of money for the billionth edition of the textbook, make sure you check that the problem set question numbers match the hardcover textbook. Also, read the textbook; if you have a bad TF, the textbook will save you.","Ec 10 is a decent course, though by no means great. However, it's unavoidable for any sort of higher level courses in Econ, so there's really not much to do.","The course starts out slow, but then it gets very interesting. If you need to have extensive feedback, you will not get it, as grading of problem sets and exams only looks at correctness and not at helping the student clear up her misconceptions. You will have to be self-directed in making sure you understand the material. Most of the concepts we learned are modeled on basic graphs of costs\/revenues and quantity, so it will help to be a visual learner. However, I did not consider myself a visual learner before entering this course and found the graphs to be very intuitive. There is not much memorization involved in this course, which instead relies on developing your ability to look at markets logically and on shaping your intuitions so that this kind of thinking becomes intuitive. I credit this course for making me more likely to concentrate in economics.","You learn the basics - the microeconomics that is necessary to understand in order to have any intelligent conversation about economics and policy.","This class is good and will be easy if you have taken AP Micro. That said, it is also slightly boring because of it. If you read the textbook and helpful hints, section is largely irrelevant.","Take to gauge as a possible concentration. Interesting course, but after this course I believe a change in plans is necessary for me.","You should take this course to learn about Economics, which everyone should know about. This class is pretty hard, but everything comes together in the end.","Go for office hours with David Johnson, he's cool. :)","great course. david is the best and basically runs the course!","If you can opt out of Ec 10, do it. This is a miserable, time consuming course. But then again, misery loves company, so take it!!","Very important information, but none of it is presented in a particularly exciting way.","You should supplement the course with other reading in order to get a more balanced perspective of economics.","This is a great class and as long as your TF is good, you will have an awesome time","If you are going to take Ec 10, you are going to take Ec 10; it doesn't matter how much the class sucks.","It's not bad for being a quick, surface-level exploration of economic ideas.","Realize it's a big course, so many aspects (i.e. testing, grading) are unwieldy and awkward. But you get a good overview of economics in general, which is useful just in life, and also a pretty decent idea of what it is like to study economics further.","How much you like Ec 10 will probably depend on what TF you get. Mine had a pretty thick accent, and it was his first year teaching...so half the time I felt like I learned nothing in section. And the textbook is too simplistic, so it doesn't help prepare you for the difficult questions on the psets and exams. Exams are hard, but the curve is good.","its not that bad. just pay attention in section.","It's surprisingly what an understanding of basic economics may do to you perspective on life.  If you've already taken an AP Economics class, I'd still recommend you take EC 10, as chances are there's plenty you won't have seen before.","Great! Section TFs do make a difference. David Johnson does a GREAT job at facilitating this course---go to his course reviews!","Take it if you want to learn the fundamentals of economics.","The textbook and section are really easy to understand, but the problem sets are extremely difficult and literally nobody can do them by themselves.  It's a huge time-suck and the exams are hard.","This class is really interesting and fun even if you're not an Ec concentrator. The tests can be kind of difficult for an elective, but the information is some of the most relevant stuff I've learned at Harvard, so I would definitely say it's worth it. Also, the math isn't too intimidating or difficult, even for those who prefer qualitative work.","BEWARE...having a bad TF will ruin this class...or Mankiw will...one or the other...it is a bummer that this is the intro ec class...interesting material but just is not taught well at all.","The class may be a little intimidating at first, put dedication to the course and the concepts allows students to grasp the concepts enthusiastically.","Whether you know it or not, you probably need to take this class.","You should only take this if you are interested in the material. If you are not, you will just feel like the whole experience is a waste of your time.","Make sure to read the book and go to lecture.  Also, if you are confronted with any problems or are having trouble understanding the material, be sure to seek help because help will not come to those who don't ask.","It is really unfortunate that Mankiw has the intro economics market cornered, if only because a monster lecture class filled with Freshmen is not really very enjoyable. That said, if you've never taken an economics class, you should do it, as having some baseline ec knowledge is essential in most social science fields.","Don't take it for a challenge.","stay on top of your work","I mean, it's a topic that you SHOULD have a basic understanding of, so this class is really your only option.","Ec10 is a great way to meet other freshman and upperclassmen. It is certainly not an easy class, but if you put the work into it you will do well. Some of the lectures are hard to follow and not that informative, but go to them because they are heavily tested.","Knowing economics is good for you! You shouldn't vote without taking some basic economics.  Mankiw isn't going to corrupt you with GOP-ness.  You'll just learn how the current system, the one that we have right now (not your favorite alternate system) works and then you can protest it all you like-- after you understand it.  Be warned though, you won't get a ton of support.  But that in and of itself is a valuable lesson, because your education is ultimately your responsibility and being able to take charge of it is a useful skill.","This class is kind of bland, but is very good for the basics of economics.","Just make sure you study the materials you should to receive a good grade.","Economics 10 was my favorite class this semester. This class is really great because it takes many things that you yourself have observed about the world and looks at them in detail to help you understand what causes these phenomena. I really like that the class is so applicable to the real world. In addition, this class is great if you put effort into it: it certainly was not my most time-consuming class this semester, but I still committed a decent amount of time to this class every week and received great results. A bit of advice: if you aren't understanding something, seek help: TF office hours, unit test graders, all of these are good ways to help you understand the information. Take advantage of these resources!","There is a really good curve, and you learn a lot more than you think. You surely have to put in the effort to get the grade, but you learn a lot about the world and you'll see how economics is applicable in all areas of life.","This class gives you a basic knolwedge of the material and is good if you are a student who has never taken an economics course before and wants to understand the subject better.","There is a lot of math so if you struggle with math or don't want to do it, think very strongly before taking this class. However, it does provide excellent skills for other things outside the class. Overall, definitely a class I would recommend but with some reservations.","I had to teach myself most of the material. This class completely overwhelmed me but at the end of the day, I'm glad I know this material. Your TF makes or breaks the class. I had a terrible TF (even regularly going to office hours didn't help) and my grade reflected that.","Regardless of what you hope to concentrate in, Ec 10 is a great class to take.  With economic policy at the forefront of the political agenda, everyone should have a basic understanding of economics now more than ever in order to be a responsible and informed citizen and voter.","great introduction to economics that covers a great deal of microeconomics but do not expect to be taught by Professor Mankiw even though he is listed as the professor, the majority of the class is taught by the section TF","Keep up on the readings, and GO TO SECTION.","It a wonderful class to take that will help you see the world differently. It will help you understand why certain policies are so and why some things in life happen, even if not pertaining to large businesses but between individuals.","Its really hard","This class is really helpful in building a foundation for economics, which everyone should have. It has the components of a large lecture class, but feels like a smaller class size because of the sections. Getting both experiences really adds to the college feel.","The course is essentially only taught in section. Material in lecture comes up only as one or two multiple choice questions in the exams and isn't always clearly synthesized with the textbook concepts. That said, it's a requirement of any Economics concentrator.","i found this course difficult, experience depends on quality of TF as most work is done in section, tests have a lot of tricks - can be disheartening.  i dont think i will continue, but it has provided me with a good background and mindframe through which to approach other areas of study","Take this only if you have to. Otherwise, you'll learn a bunch of useless crap that only professors care about. But it is a requirement for ec. Be prepared to learn useless information.","Good way to start learning Economics..Pay attention in section, because that is where the textbook material will be explained well, and go to lectures because on our 2nd midterm 4 or 5 of the multiple choice questions (out of 16) were on lectures","A great intro to Economics. The tests are hard.","This course provides important background on economics - something which plays a large role in each of our lives.  Take the course, even if you are not considering being an economics major - it really changes the way you think about things you thought you were sure about (poverty, etc.).  The course is not easy, but with moderate amounts of work, the curve will take care of you.","Economics is a very valuable course to take. The course is very well run and organized, which helps with the big size. However, the way you learn in the course depends completely on your TF.","Take this class if you want to learn economics! Do not take this class if you like intimate learning environments. I enjoyed this class because I am interested in economics and I liked reading about its connections to the real world. I usually ended up self-studying the material, so the lack of a lecture never really bothered me, though I do think that students who prefer more interactive learning environments did not enjoy the class. Also, make sure to take the unit tests and skim over the lectures and readings! It will come in handy. I thought the workload was manageable.","Only take if your are going to be an Economics concentrator","As long as you stay on top of the reading and go to class you have absolutely nothing to worry about.","This class is a great background to Econ, and though you might feel like a cog in the machine, that is a necessary evil.","The general course (the lectures, the book, the content) is very good. I got a good sense for basic microeconomics and will continue to take the macroeconomics part of Ec-10 in the spring. Unfortunately, however, there is a crucial element of the course about which students (especially freshmen not familiar with receiving bad TFs) should be warned.\r\n\r\nI learned very little from my TF and was often misled to believe something that was completely false. I think that more than half the class still believes that a concave-down curve is \"bowed outward\" not inward. And I have no idea what else I have been led to believe that might not be true. When asked questions about some of the material, he often could not come up with an answer and would defer to the class for a general consensus as to the answer. I could never trust my TF's knowledge, so I ended up mainly learning from the lectures, the book, online materials, other students, and other sections.\r\n\r\nYes, the course's curve accounts somewhat for bad TFs, but it doesn't feel that great to know that I could've learned just as much by teaching myself economics from Mankiw's textbook.\r\n\r\nWhile there are some excellent TFs (David Johnson is one of them), there are some TFs that should be avoided at any cost.\r\n\r\nGood luck!","Whatever its reputation, Ec 10 is an able and not-too-painful introduction to microeconomics and would be a useful addition to anyone's education.","Since this is a very large class, you may get lost and no one may notice. Be sure to ask questions and pay attention during section because that's where all the teaching occurs. David Johnson's review sessions were amazing--definitely attend them and he will help you synthesize. Do the unit tests because there's nothing to lose. Do the p-sets in groups and help each other!","Your success may depend on the quality of your section leader.","If you want to learn more about how the world works, take this class. You will see things in new ways. That being said, it is a long way to fulfill US in the World, and the teaching is not that great. Reading the textbook on your own would probably get you most of the information (if you're self-disciplined).","I went in knowing nothing about economics, and I felt like I have learned a lot.  It may not be the most interesting course and psets\/unit tests are a slight nuisance, but it is a pretty standard and informative introduction to economics.","It can be an interesting course. It's not one to be treated too lightly; the sections will wear on you and the homework can be tricky if you haven't gone to office hours, but not a bad way to get your US&The World Gen. Ed.","Make sure you don't get behind in the class. The key to finishing strong will be to start strong.","You don't need to know anything going in, but be prepared to learn fast! Sections are mostly a rehashing of the material in the chapters. Go to office hours!","This is a great course for anyone who is good at learning from a book. Otherwise, some students may struggle if they don't end up with a good TF (which seems fairly common). Also, students shouldn't expect anything mind-blowing in this course or to feel more informed about current economic dealings. This is an introductory course so the material can be dry, but it is fairly easy. One of the perks of this course is its light workload.","Be prepared for difficulty and a poor TF.","Required a lot of work but I learned a lot. Pretty essential knowledge for anyone interested in economics.","avoid.","Don't take this class.  It is difficult to get help, the Psets and tests are much harder than the basics that are taught in section.  The synthesis that you are expected to do in this class is horrific and the TFs are sometimes clueless.","I took it as an elective, but now I think I want to Secondary in Ec. The material feels so relevant to life! The tests are different from what you see in class though, so make sure to do the practice tests!","How well you like this course is completely dependent on your TF. MAKE SURE YOU ATTEND LECTURES! And do all the readings. The exams draw quite a bit on these.","i don't really like it... i think it turned me off from taking ec in the future because the material just isn't intuitive for me","A basic knowledge is necessary for understanding the world around you. Your experience in Ec10 will depend on your TF. Regardless of the quality of your TF's teaching, you should take Ec to be engaged with current events. You'll still learn a lot.","The class itself is kind of a pain and sections are very boring, but the information is definitely worth knowing, so I would recommend that other students take this class to gain an introductory education in the very important field of economics.","The good thing about the class is that you don't really need to worry about the small quantity of lectures by Mankiw, as you learn much more in your section. If you are lucky to have a good TF, then Ec10 might be one of your favorite classes in the given semester.","Do the reading in the textbook along with what is being discussed in section.  Also, make time for office hours; they can be very helpful.  The work is manageable and can be done well if you plan ahead.","If you do the work and reading, you will do well. You will excel if you have a strong quantitative background.","Only take it if you're interested in being an economics concentrator.","Go to office hours. Seriously. It helps a lot. But even if you get all the concepts down and do well on the problem sets, 40% of your grade is still based on one exam.  Good luck with that.","Great class with information that is applicable to everyday life. Not too difficult and problem sets don't take too much time but do require some thinking.","You will need to work hard, especially to get an A.  If you don't know anything about economics you can still take the course.  It is good knowledge to have in general and I like the fact that I took the course because I did learn a lot.","This is not the easy course that many would like you to believe it is. It is challenging, and will require going to office hours and struggling on problem sets and exams. The exams are very challenging, and a 65% is usually the average - though the curve accounts for this. Difficult to get an A, though Bs are very realistic. The material is interesting, and makes sense. Head TF David Johnson is a phenomenal teacher - Go to his office hours!! Professor Mankiw is a good lecturer, but the class is taught in section, and so your TF will be the most important influence on your experience; most are at least fairly good teachers. If you are an Economics concentrator, you must take it; if not, it's still a great course to take.","Your TF can make or break this class.","You cannot rely on section.  You have to use a lot of your own initiative.","Ec 10 isn't as painful as people say, and it does a good job explaining intro economics. Be sure to go to lecture and pay attention, since you'll lose 20\/120 points on exams if you don't.","Although the course advertises Mankiw as its teacher, he only gives lectures four times a semester, and there are some guest lectures. Two were good and two weren't. You will be doing a very significant percentage of your learning in section, so it really depends on your section leader. This course gives a solid introduction to microeconomics and macroeconomics, so I'd recommend it as preparation for taking more advanced economics courses. Also, if you take this course, you MUST go to David Johnson's (the head TF) review session. He's really effective and funny. Too bad only a dozen or so students get him as their TF.","Mankiw does not actually teach this course...","I took this course pass fail and put very little work into it.  I basically just learned from the book.  The book is awesome.  The teaching is just the book rehashed in a worse form.  Take it as you will.","hard class be ready to work","This course is all about whether or not you get a good TF. The material is very interesting and I believe that everyone should take this course because of the information it provides. However, this course is fundamentally flawed when it comes to TFs because some are great and some are absolutely terrible.","Ec 10 sucks.  Only take if you have to.  You'll learn stuff, but college and Harvard especially should realize that we are here to intellectually engage with the material, not be patronized in lecture in section by re-explaining for an hour what could be gleaned in five minutes of reading the textbook.","This class is not easy, especially since the questions are in-depth than the normal AP Economics. People who previously took AP Economics found this class challenging, making this class not really an \"Introduction\" course. The problem sets are tedious and difficult to say the least, and the teaching fellow could possibly not be helpful.","It is a class that teaches you, for the most part, material that you could learn or teach yourself by reading the textbook or any AP economics textbook. The only interesting parts were the synthesis of concepts that occured during David Johnson's review sessions, which tied together the dry facts that had been taught in section into more realistic and interesting problems to think about as they applied to real life.","Ec 10 is a great way to learn about economics even if you don't want to concentrate in the field.","Do the problem sets and readings by yourself; you won't learn anything if you copy either of these things. The lectures are interesting and the tests always have some kind of questions on them, so don't skip out.","Good intro to economics. I just with there was a better alternative.","the information is presented in a rather nonpartisan manner. Definitely worth taking if you want a background in economics. very worthwhile course.","Understand that Pr. Mankiw's book and lectures are often just an opinion, and not necessarily economic fact (there is almost never such a thing). If you understand that Ec10 is just a model to better understand capitalist economics, then take the course. Your section leader can often make or break your experience in the class, since Mankiw lectures so little.","Its a great way to combine interests in government and mathematics.","The class is very engaging, but the execution\/setup of this course is lacking.","Don't fall behind on the work. Prepare for exams a good week or more in advance -- do lots of practice problems! Be willing to invest time in this class and you shouldn't have any trouble.","It's not too difficult, and you can learn a lot if you get a good section leader. Do keep in mind that the professor only teaches about 6 times in a semester.","Good overview and good intro.","This class is easy, but with that you realize you don't learn very much.  Take as a 5th or 6th class.","Be prepared to work through ideas and concepts mostly on your own, which is a process that bears its own academic fruit, but is often unglamorous and difficult. The TFs are good, but most of the learning happens alone in the library rather than in lecture or section.","Unless you are an econ major, you will sleep through the lectures, nod blankly during section, and probably struggle through the problem sets in the back of the lamont cafe with the rest of the people who took this as a gen ed. Prepare for long thursdays.","It requires a lot of work outside of section in order to understand the material and do well on exams.","Recommend mainly because you need it for an Ec concentration and pretty useful in the real world. But the way it's taught is pretty bad for such an important class. Section very useless.","This class is tough. The textbook is interesting\/easy to get through, but the problem sets can be really difficult and time-consuming (and the grading of them can be harsh as well). The exams are really,really hard too, but the curve is pretty generous to compensate. I feel like this is a class that everyone should take though, especially because so much of what you learn can be applied to the real world.","It could be a very boring experience sometimes, but what else can you expect from an introductory coarse.","Its a big course - don't expect to much of a personal approach in the teaching","Exactly what you might expect from an extremely large, freshman, introductory Economics course. Pretty impersonal, the teaching fellows do not all have a solid handle on the English language, the professor wrote the insanely expensive textbook, and [on the plus side] it is as advertised - you WILL learn Economics.","The ease of this  class' material  can be deceptive, I  thought it was easy until I took my first midterm.","Your TF determines the quality of your experience. If you end up with a bad TF like I did, just go talk to David Johnson!","Take the unit tests, make sure you get a good TF, don't expect too much from Mankiw, go to David Johnson's review lectures...","The material taught in this course changed my view on economics, my view on numerous political issues and the way I approach my every day life. Absolutely worth taking!","Ec10 is a solid foundation for economics. If you put in the time (read the book, go to office hours if you don't understand the psets), you will learn a lot. David Johnson makes the P-sets tough. Also, make sure to read the helpful hints!","Basically, take this class if you didn't take economics in high school and you want a decent foundation in the field.  I'm not sure it would be all that helpful if you had taken AP micro & macro, but since I hadn't, I did learn a lot.  Make sure you get a good TF though; since the course is almost entirely taught in section, both your understanding and your grade will depend on the quality of the TF.  Also, definitely do problem sets in groups, particularly with friends with different TFs.","If this course is ever offered with David Johnson as the head lecturer, take it immediately.","This is your run of the mill large gened that is taught mostly in poorly taught sections. Your experience largely depends on what section leader you get, which is totally arbitrary. However, the textbook is pretty interesting and the material is useful information. Still, if you don't need to take this class for a concentration requirement, consider alternatives to learn economics.","It doesn't excite you--you need to bring your own enthusiasm for learning.","If you can't avoid it, you can't avoid it. Just try to actually read the textbook, it's often more helpful than section.","The course is extremely impersonal; grading on tests are arbitrary. Points are taken off with no explanations given","This class is horribly boring and difficult but super useful","Your experience in this class will likely depend on the quality of your TF, and that's something that's unlikely to change without a complete overhaul of the course. That being said, the lectures are generally interesting, and section provides a solid introduction to the material. Though problem sets often require you to do some extra fact-finding (aka working heavily with other students \/ contacting your TF) to get them done right, the workload is by no means unmanageable. If you've never taken an economics course, Ec 10 is a good place to start; but if you've already done Micro\/Macro AP in high school, you're probably better off going straight into 1010a\/b.","Its a worthwhile course.","I thought it was a great class to take as a sophomore not concentrating in economics. I had zero economics background and didn't think I would enjoy the class at all, but ended up loving it!","This course does do a great job of presenting the fundamental principles of microeconomics","It was ok. I had a good section leader, though--if you don't get a good section leader, you won't like it as much.","Its good info to know.","This is a good course if you want an introduction to microeconomics.","If you want to learn basics of economics or pursue a concentration in economics, this is a great course to take.","It is almost entirely conducted in section so make sure you get a good TF. The problem sets are hard and takes a couple of hours to do. \r\nI have never taken economics before and find this course hard but the book is easy to understand.","Most of the learning you end up doing on your own. The course is not structured to show you how to do the work on the psets\/exams.","Definitely need a back round in economics","If you're unsure whether or not you want to concentrate in\/get a secondary in econ, I would take this class to help you decide. I didn't like the class very much, but taking ec10 at least allowed me to decide against a concentration\/secondary in econ. As for the class itself, the lectures are pretty interesting but the sections are pretty boring. The biggest issue is that you'll see these whacko problems on exams and psets that you don't really learn how to do in section and can't figure out based on the information in the book.","Lots of work. All work done in section. Little math preparation for doing problem sets. Lots of people who take it have taken Econ before.","Read the textbook yourself.","Take this course, if only because you should have a basic understanding of how the economy works. This is our best option to obtain it.","This is a must-take course. You will learn the economic facts needed to develop a cogent economic and political worldview. Even if you get a bad TF, it is more than possible to do well if you ACTUALLY read the book (it's actually very interesting) and read through the helpful hints and read the P-set answers. I would recommend it to anyone at Harvard who is even mildly interested in politics and current events. It covers so much of what happens in society. This is knowledge everyone should have.","This is a great class to build a strong foundation in economics. It is an introductory course, but the problem sets and exams require you to synthesize the material in a challenging, but fair way.","It a great class the familiarizes you with the basics of economics. The knowledge gained is definitely worth the moderate difficulty.","So far, this course has been a great introduction into economics. It is not the most exciting course, but it fulfills its purpose and will teach you a lot!","Economics is one of the most fundamental studies, and this is the intro to that class. If you want to do anything in economics, take this course.. Provides good foundation","If you are a humanities student (especially an upperclassman) looking for an overview of economics under some grandiose intention of \"educating herself,\" don't do it. The course is more demanding and difficult than it appears. And although it is a survey course, much of the application of material is involved. For pure conceptual understanding, just reading the textbook on your off-time might be the best bet.","A lot of it you will have to study on your own and in terms of TFs, it's the luck of the draw.","Ec10 is useful and effective, but I doubt many students deeply enjoy it.","It is hard, but worthwhile. It will affect the way you think about people, wealth, and the world. Not for everyone, but I enjoy it. I think everyone should know a little bit about economics. Its not taught at a lot of high schools.","Sections are a drag but the subject matter is interesting and relevant","Learn the material","Obviously, this is a huge class and everything is taught in section. However, section leaders tend to just rehash what is already written in Mankiw's textbook.","you need to take this even if it isn't fun.","its not all its cracked up to be. but also, the mankiw haters are really few and far between. his course\/work is not biased, it teaches sensibly.","Not fun, but an easy A","If your TF is good, perhaps you'll enjoy and learn a lot from this class; if not, be prepared to self-teach. The fact that a lot of people have taken Econ before does not help. Furthermore, the disparity between what one reads in the textbook and may learn in section, and what one must do on problems sets and exams, is tremendous.","It is a decent class... I feel somewhat prepared to engage in further studies in economics.","Ec 10 will provide a great economic base to students who wish to take it. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in economics or the issues of the world. I think the course is so important in learning how the world works that it should be required for freshmen.","A lot of people that I talked to had fairly negative impressions of Economics 10, but I found the class perfectly enjoyable.  It's not necessarily the most exciting class you will be enrolled in, but the material is interesting in its way, and also very applicable.  As long as you stay on top of the readings and sections, the workload is very manageable.","If you think that this is a class where Gregory Mankiw is your professor: it's not. He lectures a handful of times the entire year. Two of these lectures are held the first two classes, when students are shopping and debating whether or not to enroll in the course. Another one is conveniently on parents' weekend, so all the parents can believe that the large amount of money they're shelling out is going to a great lecturer. Instead your experience in the class is largely determined by the quality of the TF that you are randomly assigned. If you end up with a good TF, you are likely to enjoy the course. However, there are several horror stories out there with TF's, so be careful.","Wait until sophomore year to take it, unless you really think you may become an Ec concentrator.","It was somewhat interesting yet a little dry with a fair bit of reading.","Feeling like I should know some economics to be a responsible global citizen, I took this as a senior elective.  I was very disappointed in the course.  The lectures are generally boring and superficial, and the course as a whole essentially boils down to a supervised reading of Mankiw's textbook, which itself feels like something out of high school.  The course makes no attempt to present material rigorously (I lost count of the number of times I heard\/read \"the mathematics behind this is beyond the scope of this course.\"), which I found frustrating as a math concentrator, but that might be a plus for some people.  The class did do a very good job, however, of making me feel comfortable with the vocabular of basic economics.  I wouldn't expect to get much more out of the course, though.","This is a great course that gives you a great foundation in economic understanding. A great course to take, even for non-economic concentrators. It gives you the basic skill set needed to know what is going on in the economy and evaluate economic arguments.","Take Ec 10 if you are passionate about economics\/are considering studying economics. Don't take the class because everybody else does.","It really is not as bad as people make it out to be and the workload is really doable, especially if you keep up with the readings and spread the work out. Do not take this class if you like working alone. It is much more of a group experience.","While it can often seem like an endless struggle, the amount that you learn is worth it. Even if you will not end up concentrating in economics, it is beneficial to learn the basic concepts behind something that surrounds you every day.","It's not a very exciting or stimulating class, it can at times be a little frustrating, but it gives you a solid necessary basis of knowledge in economics.","If you have no economics background and a decent math background, this is a good introductory course for you to take.  It's not fascinating, but it will get the job done.","Very interesting material and great introduction to economics.  It is important to stay on top of textbook readings and do thorough jobs on the problem sets to understand the material well for the exam.  Take advantage of the unit test program and TF's office hours.","This class, despite its occasional flaws, teaches a way of seeing and analyzing the world that all Harvard students should introduce themselves to.  Take it if you want to better understand (at least one prominent theory of) how the world around you works.","I took this class as a senior p\/f in order to learn a general literacy in economics (I knew literally nothing before it) and I have found it so useful. I would never recommend taking this class as an elective for a grade, but p\/f it's AWESOME. I feel as though I can actually discuss economic and political issues with basic understanding now.","It's not great, but Ec 10 is what it is: An impersonal, frequently irritating machine through which hundreds of students will pass every year, because Ec 10 is the intro economics sequence. It won't be terribly fun, it won't be that terrible either, and you'll emerge knowing more economics than you did when you entered the class. \r\n\r\nA good number of the guest lectures were utterly pointless, but I should add that David Johnson, the guy really behind the class, is absolutely fantastic. Go to his review sessions; go to the ends of the earth to get in his section. He's the only remotely competent teacher in the class.","Many people take this class thinking that they want a foundation in economics that they never had before. I would say there are hundreds of other ways that you could do this efficiently, such as picking up Adam Smith and reading him. You don't have to go through Ec10.","You should take it!","This is a course about the fundamentals that everyone should have some knowledge of. Very well-structured, although the TFs are not very useful. Go to David Johnson's office hours\/ exam reviews: he is excellent ! If you do the psets yourself, read the book, go to lecture, you will get a good grade without too much effort. The concepts are in general well-explained as are their relevance to current economic problems. A useful course.","This course covers material that is useful to know regardless of your academic interests.","Sections, lectures, the textbook, exams and problem sets, are all taught or written by different people. I think this is why there is little unity between the concepts of economics and the questions in the tests. Reading the textbook or going to section does not prepare you to do the problem sets or take the exams. If you are new to economics, a lot of work is required to stay on top of this course, above going to lectures, sections and reading the textbook.","Do the readings in the textbook","There is not enough time to complete the tests, which is very frustrating.","Work together on problem sets and go to David Johnson for office hours- he provides the best feedback out of any TF.","The important thing about this course is not that you know how to draw all of the graphs and recite definitions, but that you are able to synthesize and apply the information you have learned.","This is the basic intro course for Chemistry and Biology.  You get a collection of people taking it: brilliant bio\/chem people, overzealous pre-meds, naive elective takers, and various others.  If you are very good at chem\/bio, you should have no problem.  If you aren't, it is still very possible to do well in this course; you just need to work a little harder and find people who can help you understand the concepts.","Really study for the midterms","The concepts are very easy but the problem sets and tests present them in difficult ways.","I found econ 10 to be pretty interesting, but with the massive number of students taking the course you tend to loose touch with the head teachers. The psets themselves weren't too difficult, but the midterms and final expect you to combine multiple concepts in one problem, so definitely look at previous tests. Overall, I think everyone should take at least a semester of this course before graduating.","This course is fundamental to a well rounded undergraduate education. Learning these fundamentals is essential to better understand and participate constructively in national and international economic debate.","It is a very interesting class that involves both lecture and section however you have to be ready for long problem sets, albeit only one per week. Also tests require a good amount of studying, much like most other classes.","It's a good class and tests are not very difficult if you put a reasonable amount of time into the p-sets.","It's difficult, and I didn't enjoy it, but it's the only comprehensive beginning economics course Harvard has. Do all the unit tests because they're hard to fail, so they're basically free extra credit.","Good intro class","The course is pretty much what everyone says it will be: a big lecture designed to teach the basics of economics in a short amount of time. The class is good if you want a general knowledge of economics, otherwise, probably is not worth taking.","The TF is everything","This is not a class where you learn how to work in Wall Street or how to run a business. You learn how an economy works, which is something I feel everyone should know about especially in our our current economic climate and situation.","Ec 10 is a satisfying class. If you have never had any contact with economics, you will learn a lot from this class. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if you have even considered the possibility of concentrating in the social sciences, Ec 10 is a pretty much required class. Be warned though that the class assumes you are at least somewhat good in algebra and functions. This warning is directed at non-science concentrators, sho I think should take this course, but may not necessarily have the required mathematical sophistication to understand the elegant conclusions that the class reaches. If you are one such person, I would recommend you to brush up on your high school math before enrolling, work hard by going to office hours and unit tests, and really make an effort to try to think of economics in a mathematical sense. Mankiw is a great teacher and really friendly. He is also not nearly as fiscally conservative as people make him  look like, and this is coming from a very liberal person. However, his textbook is poor at best. In a misguided attempt to attract more \"students who are bad at math\" and improve his Q scores, Mankiw made a textbook that is sometimes too long on explanations and too short on mathematical rigor. The result of this \"dumbing down\" is to make the course less satisfactory to everyone involved. Even with this small flaws, I would be likely to recommend this course to future students. You definitely learn a lot, and the thing you learn in this course are useful in a wide range of fields. It is also a way to fulfill a Gen Ed requirement (US in the World or Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning). If you are an incoming freshman, strongly consider taking Ec 10.","EC10 is an unfortunate requirement for the Economics department. Although it provides the masses with some basic knowledge of a form of economics, it does not generate a student's interest in what Economics should be truly about.","Ec 10 is a Harvard tradition, and rightly so. I would encourage any student interested in economics, politics or even current affairs in general to take this course. This course provides the foundation necessary to comprehend important contemporary developments and reveals the intuition behind the market forces that govern our society. \r\nI would encourage any student in this course to effectively use the available resources. Office hours with TFs, and especially David Johnson, can be immensely rewarding. To this end, it's important to get an early start on P-Sets so that you can have pertinent questions to ask - when given the opportunity.\r\nAdmittedly, this course doesn't contain a lot of mathematics, but if you really want to see the mathematical side of this subject, you should ask at office hours. My experience has been that David Johnson is extremely willing to teach this kind of material and willing to engage with students that seek extension.","Make sure you keep up with the readings in the textbook because it really helps when you work on the problem sets.","If you can skip it to 1010, do it. If you want an intro ec course as an elective, take it.","You do not feel valued as a student, so you are going to have to take the initiative and do a lot of extra work on your own.","Great class; Mankiw doesn't teach much, but he doesn't have to. I had a great TF, which helped quite a bit, but really, it wouldn't make sense for Mankiw to teach to class more than he does. Ec10 is so applicable to life in general, and should be required for every student to take before leaving college.","Do it if you have serious interest in economics.","If you want to learn the basics of economics, take it. It's not substantively different from AP ec in high school, but if they didn't offer it (or you just didn't take it), be sure to get the knowledge.","TAKE THIS COURSE because the material covered is very relevant, useful, and interesting. However, do not expect to enjoy it much. The course set-up is not ideal and you almost never see Mankiw. Still yet, since everyone wants to major in Economics, you're going to have to take this course no matter what in the end.","This class can be very stressful, especially if you have little experience with economics. I probably wouldn't recommend the course, but 700+ students take it, so I guess it's almost a necessary evil.","Get ready for the workload.","This is an excellent class for any Harvard undergrad.  I learned a huge amount about economics over the course of this semester, and I know any student can reap the same benefits.  Mankiw is an excellent professor who is very accessible through his office hours.  Overall, I never found the class particularly difficult, but it was always enjoyable.","The TF structure isn't the best, nor are the lectures necessarily, but the course does teach a lot of incredibly useful information. The textbook is great.","Mankiw is distant, but this course is a must-take at Harvard.","I took this class pass\/fail - good idea if you are a senior looking for a great and broad introduction to economics.","Even if you aren't a fan of economics, this is a course everyone should take because the concepts are so fundamentally ingrained in society.","Mankiw is basically a figurehead for the course... everything you learn will be in section, but they'll take some obscure detail from the lecture, put it on the test, and pretend it's important. Otherwise it's a good intro ec course - just don't go in expecting to have face time with a celebrity professor.","This class pushes a conservative\/libertarian\/neoliberal economic agenda - through the textbook, most lectures, and the syllabus that TFs are supposed to follow.  Such bias permeates the discussion around many issues - the distribution of wealth, taxation, the minimum wage, trade policies, meritocracy, monopoly power, etc.  I did not find this surprising, given Professor Mankiw's background, but it was definitely a turn-off. That said, if you have a good TF (the class is taught almost entirely in section), this course can be interesting and you can definitely learn important concepts - economics is an incredibly important field.  Just be sure to think for yourself and not necessarily believe everything you hear or read.","Be careful with it. Make sure you catch up with the readings and work with classmates.","This is a very good course to gain a grasp on basic economics however it is a difficult class to have a working understanding of.","Pay attention to the guest lecturers, there are always questions about their presentations on the exams!","Go into this class with your eyes open. It won't always (or even most of the time) be fun.","Ec-10 gives you a good general understanding of economics.  It is poorly taught and you have to do a lot of learning yourself. Make sure you understand and read the helpful hints and also get a buddy to the problem sets with.","It's a pain, but you'll be glad you took it. It's always good to have a solid understanding of economic issues just to be an informed and rational member of society.","Mankiw and guest lectures connect what you learn in the course to the economic issues of the nation and world. Section should, if you have a halfway decent TF, explain what you might have misunderstood in the book, but overall, Principles of Economics is an outstanding, easy to comprehend textbook.","It's taught entirely in section!  So unless you get a good tf (of which there are probably 2 total) this will be a very very long year","It's pretty tough and a large time commitment with the problem sets.","Be prepared to do a lot of learning on your own","The material covered in this class is very interesting and really makes you think about the world differently.","If you get a great TF, you will receive one of the greatest learning experiences of your Harvard life. If you don't, you will suffer for one term.","This class is challenging but totally doable. The problem sets take a bit of time, but they are fair and there's only 6 a semester.","Don't believe Professor Mankiw when he says that this course leaves all normative values at the door. Otherwise, it's an easy course that is useful.","The evaluations (midterms and finals) are much more difficult than the problem sets, unit tests and problems offered in section.","This course provides an excellent base for understanding the economic aspects of our world.","Ec 10 is good for introducing yourself to economics. It's useful for many concentrations and definitely necessary for econ majors. I'd advise taking it.","This course is not that difficult--just be sure not to fall behind on the reading! (I did, and had to read 10 chapters in a day, the weekend before my unit test...needless to say, that was a bad idea)","I would recommend this class, but it was very difficult to balance the workload of problem sets of Math and Economics at the same time. If I had enrolled in those two classes at different semesters it would have made my life a lot easier.","This class is a big time commitment and the tests are very hard. The curves are great though.","It is an interesting class and if you have any interest in taking economics I would recommend taking it.","I took this class because I wanted to be able to speak intelligently about current economic matters - I didn't learn enough practical applications of what we learned about.","Ec 10 sections are almost entirely theoretical, with a TF mostly explaining word for word the concepts written in the textbook. Then students are handed problem sets and exams with problems asking them to apply those concepts -- even though they have had no practice doing so in class. This would be a far better course if section was a time for practice problems rather than repetition of the textbook.","The experience you have largely depends on the section leader you get (because most of the class is taught in section). Make sure you talk to people and try to get someone who is good. The course was very organized and helps people kinda decide whether they really enjoy ec.","Generic economics course.  Somewhat interesting.","It starts off really slowly but gradually picks up speed. The lectures are not so great but remember that the tiniest thing from them could be asked on an exam. Take help on the psets if you have problems, your section leaders are happy to give you the answers.","A great class that helps you think in a different way.","Although this class can be difficult at times (the exams are difficult), this class was a good overall introductory economics course. Make sure you get a good TF who grades fairly and understands the material well.","Take it!!! it is very good for your future","Your experience all depends on your section leader.","Be prepared to spend lots of time on the problem sets and reading the textbook if you want to actually know the material and do well on the exams.","Read the textbook and utilize office hours and review sessions","Expect the TF's to suck","Ec10 is not the best or easiest class.  It requires disciplined work outside of class, but it also provides a very solid background in economics that is useful for any field of study.","You have to take it if you're interested in Econ. Just try to get a good TF, go to David Johnson's office hours, and do psets in groups.","Ec 10 is not always the most interesting or exciting course, but it does give you essential knowledge for understanding much of what is happening in the world today. I would reccommend this course, even if you're not an economics concentrator.","Fascinating material.  It will give you a different way of looking at the world whether you want to go into econ or not.  Section is hit or miss.  If you have a bad section leader switch out in the beginning.","EC10 is not a class that many people will rave about, but it is nonetheless a very educational course that gives insight into very relevant topics in today's world.","This course is very badly structured but the material is interesting. If you want to take a course with a professor that really wants to educate his\/her students, this is not the course for you. In Ec10, your left on your own and a lot of the responsibilities of understanding the material is put on your shoulders.","Great introduction to economics!","The tests are ridiculous. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO DEAL WITH TRICKY QUESTIONS AND CONVOLUTED PROBLEMS. Not worth it.","USE OFFICE HOURS ALL THE TIME","This class is not bad if you do all the problem sets ahead of time.","This class is very helpful and practical no matter what concentration you hope to pursue. The course can either be wonderful or tragic depending on your perspective and whom your TF is. Just make sure you do everything in your power (attending office hours, reading all chapters and helpful hints, etc) to conquer the class and you should do fine.","From what I've heard from other people, your experience really depends on your TF, since almost all of the first semester is taught in section, especially the first quarter.  I had a great TF and although he was tough in section, I learned a lot and was very prepared.","Solid course; pretty much as advertised. Not too difficult but not easy either. Good intro to ec. Unit tests suck.","MANKIW DOES NOT TEACH THIS COURSE!!!!! Take this course because you want to learn more about economics. The lectures were boring and your TF will determine your overall experience in the course. BEWARE OF EC-10!!!!","It is definitely a course the requires a deep understanding of economics and a lot of time, but if you are interested in the subject, go for it!","If you have a good math background, take EC1010 or EC1011 instead. The course is excellent, but the math is very basic.","This is a class that very section-based and your experience will depend heavily on how good your section leader is. Overall, you cover a tremendous amount of material that is decently interesting\/useful.","Do the reading before section! Always! It will help you learn SO much more!","its an intro class to an field that, like it or not, is important to know a little about. i had to do it to fulfill a concentration requirement and it wasnt fun, but it was better than LS1a as far as intro courses go.","It is a right of passage for any ec student. Section is relatively easy and the problem sets are manageable. Go to office hours and actually do the reading and the helpful hints and it should not that difficult.","Take it! You might hear the class is biased or that the lectures are boring, and that might be true, but you should still know economics. It's really not that hard and it's a great bonding experience.","If you want to learn economics this is obviously the class to take, but your grade largely depends on what TF you get.","Don't take this just because everyone does; make sure you're actually interested in the topic.","Useful, and I feel like I learned a significant amount, but midterms and the final were hard! Doing well on psets and feeling like you understand the material decently is definitely not enough to do well in the course.","I took the class because I really wanted to learn the material, and I feel like I came away with the ability to engage in debates that I wouldn't have been able to previously. However, don't be afraid to be skeptical of Mankiw's ideas. We go to Harvard, we're smart enough to recognize what's objective and what's not.","its a good\/interesting class..i would recommend it if you want to consider taking higher level economics courses. or if unsure about what to concentrate in.","If you don't like your TF in the first several classes, request to be switched! The TF makes it or breaks it. Also, go to all of the Unit Tests and make a study group with friends to get the p-sets done each week! I recommend getting work done in an upperclass dining hall (even if you're a freshman) and spreading out until it's done.","You have to take this, and it teaches you important things about human nature and current affairs. Just be pro-active and hardworking.","Lots depends on your section leader. Mine was engaging but didn't know the material as well as she probably should have, and there were those two or three kids in the section who kept derailing the entire discussion with irrelevant questions. Mankiw is fine, and the guest lecturers are hit-and-miss. Overall, an okay course. There are worse, but there are also definitely better.","don't go to mankiw's lectures","Very easy introduction to economics. Definitely the best US in the World class, which this class for some reason fills. Much more useful than most of the others available, which seem more focused on sillier questions.","Basic ec knowledge is useful whether you live under a rock or not. Ec10 is an intro course, but you'll find ways to apply it everywhere (even under your rock). Grading (especially of problem sets) and quality of teaching varies a lot from section to section, but sections follow the textbook very very closely. Tests and psets are all easily manageable if you've been keeping up. Read the green boxes in the textbook!","It is a good course to learn about the basics of economics, but you learn mostly from reading the book. The section leaders (aside from David Johnston) and lectures don't really teach you anything","This class will introduce you to a way of thinking that is valuable regardless of one's political or academic persuasion. Truly a must-take.","The micro part of economics (Fall) may not be the most exciting, but if you have a good TF it can still be interesting. All in all, it is an intro economics course, so most of it will be not terribly exciting. It's good stuff to know, though.","This course is extremely rewarding as long as you are willing to dedicate an adequate amount of time. The readings are enjoyable as long as you don't fall behind--section will then be useless. If you attend section regularly and complete the assigned work, the material will make sense and you won't have to spend time cramming for exams. This course has inspired me to continue my studies in the field of economics.","It is easier to do problem sets with study groups.","This course is a fairly good introduction to basic economics but can sometimes be frustrating when it comes to understanding the solutions for problem sets and review materials. I'd recommend taking it at some point, use because economics is one of those things that will always always come up in life.","Take this class if you are truly interested in pursuing economics and if you don't mind teaching yourself most of the course","Economics is good to know in general and I am glad I took this course because I am far better informed now. However, the class can get dry and very graphs-oriented, and unless it is a concentration requirement or you are seriously considering economics it might not be the most captivating, interesting course to take. Also, the class is taught in section (with a couple of large lectures) by mostly grad students so the TF you get and their teaching abilities can vary wildly.","If you actually do the reading and do the problem sets yourself, this class is very easy. It's a great way to learn the basics of economics, so if you're at all interested in this then you should definitely take this class. Make sure you like your TF, though!","Hope for a good section leader.","The class is easy for some and very difficult for others. The good news is that if you work hard on the course and keep up with the work and Unit tests even if you don't get a phenomenal grade you will get a fair one.","This is a great way to learn economics, and more importantly, to simply be better informed about the debates going on in the world.","Skip it if possible","It's a relatively good introduction to economics and manageable for the most part.","David Johnson is an incredible man.  Mankiw's lecturing is underwhelming.","Pretty hard but you learn really interesting stuff and you'll like studying it.","The class is a good introduction to economics, but that's all it is. Keeping up with the course reading makes time spent in section pretty useless as almost all of section time is spent taking notes on definitions and concepts from the book.","Very good introductory class. It is really well-organized. The material is interesting and seemingly relevant to real life. The material is not terribly earth-shattering, but is useful. Sometimes is challenging. Tests and problem sets are often difficult, but challenge you to apply and understand the application of concepts, not just rote memorization.","I think that your experience in this class strongly depends on who your section leader is.","Yes, the book is expensive, and yes, Mankiw only teaches 6 times a semester. But in all fairness, it's a good textbook and the TF's are generally knowledgeable about the subject matter. Recommended for anyone interested in current events or just another way of seeing the world.","Go in knowing the prof won't be teaching everything.. in fact, lecturing only a few times per year. Also, getting a good TF is your ticket to this class w\/o reading the book.","Very good introductory economics course. By all means take it!","You may struggle through this course, but is jam-packed with knowledge every citizen in this country should possess. If anything, take it out of a sense of civic duty.","unless it's necessary, i wouldn't take it.  harvard has so many better classes","Like everyone says, getting into David Johnson's section is critical for this class. However, if you do not get into his section don't despair -- some of the other section leaders aren't bad either, but most importantly David Johnson holds office hours Tuesdays and Thursdays several hours a day. Go to these. They are very, very helpful.","I would tell them to read before the section so that they can have an idea about what the class is about. Also, really learn the concepts not memorize how to do problems.","It isn't perfect, but as big lecture courses go, I thought it was pretty good. Most of the time is spent in section, which is helpful, and there are plenty of opportunities to get help if you need it.","This is a great introductory economics class.  However, you really have to get lucky with who your TF is because you learn almost all the material in section.  For example, my TF Harry is kind of crazy but he's an excellent teacher.  He knows what he's talking about.  The psets aren't that bad.  You need to read the textbook and pay attention during the lectures which take place every now and then because David Johnson likes to asks questions from both of these sources on the tests.  Overall, take the class if you have even a slight interest in economics!","There are many people in it who take it because everyone else is taking it and I would refrain from doing so if you are unsure about wanting to.","Get a good section leader. If you don't get a good section leader, switch sections.","It's important that you learn this stuff.","I have to say that a lot of criticisms this class receives are deserved. Your grade will likely be determined by the strength of your TF, the P-Set questions are often huge leaps above the material covered in class, and it seems that no one can fail this class, no matter how dumb. My advice is simple and seemingly obvious; work with your friends and go to the Unit Tests, as those will teach you a lot!","Despite its drawbacks I love the class and the material we learn is highly relevant and applicable. Be sure to go to David Johnson's office hours.","i took this class an elective. for all taking this as an elective, there are a few things to keep in mind. 1. this course is time consuming. problem sets are long and weekly (they took about 7 hours to do), in addition to reading the textbook chapters and understanding the material from section 2. the coursewide lectures and readings really make the class difficult and in many ways unfair. they are hard to keep up with, so make sure you keep up with them. 3. unit tests are a good way to boost your grade, but add on at least an extra 2 hrs of work a week. so basically, taking this class to just get an overview of economics, might not be the best choice. if you're taking it as an elective, be prepared for a lot of work, especially if you want to do well. the time put in may not be worth it. it is probably better spent on your required courses","It's not a challenging course. If you read the textbook before each lecture and section, you'll be fine. Also, go to Johnson's review sessions; they help so much. Take unit tests."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Take it, just so you can understand the world better.  You don't need to love economics, you just need to love better understanding how markets work, and where you fit in them.","If you got a 5 on macro, you should skip the course and take 1010.  If you didn't, you should take this course.  I think everyone should at some point take micro\/macro simply because it's so essential to understanding much of what goes on in the world around us and politically.  The leap from 0-->ec10 is much larger than ec10-->ec1010, so if you have experience with econ, you should take 1010.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual course, the lectures in macro get a lot of bigshots for lectures and there are a lot more of them than in micro.  Sections are hit or miss, but if you don't get a good section, then you can always go to the office hours of other TFs to balance that out, and it's really not that big of a deal.","Macroeconomics is a valuable class because it is important to understand the basic structure of the economy. This class helps you understand world events in greater depth. However, Ec 10 is a lot of teaching yourself. Unless you get a good TF, it can be hard to understand some of the topics in the class. I would recommend taking this course even if you don't want to go into economics because it's important to understand more about finance and the world.","Solid course. Macro was more interesting for me than micro, and I think that's the case for most people. It's not as easy as some make it seem, but it's also not an overly difficult course. You're enjoyment of the class depends GREATLY on your section leader, so try and not get stuck with one that you don't like.","It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.","Ec10 is a solid foundational class. Your experience in Ec10 depends heavily on how good your section leader is, as nearly all of the class is taught in section. I'd recommend it if your interested in macroeconomics at all. It's a lot more applicable than microeconomics and teaches concepts that everyone should at least have a background in.","Read parts of the book before you take the class. If you fall asleep, it is a good indicator that you will not like the class. If you don't and are interested, then you are likely to be an Econ concentrator.","Especially if you have never taken an economic class before, Ec10 is a fantastic introductory course that gives a very comprehensive overview of micro and macroeconomics. It is a good gateway for further coursework in the subject and allows you to build a solid foundation of knowledge about the US economy. The line-up for guest lecturers for the course is always fantastic, with many of the biggest names in the economics field today. One thing to note is that this course is primarily taught in section by graduate student TFs, so that may something to consider if that is an important factor in course selection for you.","Everyone should take ec.10!","Use the textbook, as it can be pretty helpful. Go to the Head TF's office hours--David Johnson really knows what he's talking about. Learning really depends on your section leader's ability to teach or your ability to digest the information in the textbook. Exams can include questions, particularly short answers, which leave everyone wondering what they're talking about.","Everyone should take this course, because it prepares you to be a responsible citizen and voter.","The class itself is not great but an introductory economics course is nonetheless a \"must-take\"","I would recommend that, if you have any interest at all about the the world works, to take this class. It provided me with a good introduction to financial markets and the thought process behind the economic decisions of the Fed. The psets are not bad at all (you can finish them the night before). Section can be kinda hit or miss. Some section leaders integrate the material well into current events and can explain the material well, and some just regurgitate from the textbook. If you can, I would recommend just sitting in on David Johnson's section to really understand how the material you learn works. He provides current events before each section ,and how the concepts we are learning relate to these events. As opposed to most section leaders, he goes levels above the basic understanding of concepts and applies them to multiple problems. Overall, a good course.","Get ready to work out, but its worth it.","You might not enjoy it, but you don't really have a choice. Guest lectures are generally interesting, but you learn most of the material in section. How much you learn (and how interesting you find the material) will depend heavily on your section leader, but assuming you get a good one, this class isn't all that bad. The textbook isn't very helpful given that the material on problem sets and exams is far more in-depth, but if you pay attention and take notes in section (or have took Micro\/Macro AP in high school), you'll be just fine.","Problem sets = hard but interesting class","Do not underestimate this class! The key to doing well is getting a good TF. If you are dissatisfied with your particular TF, try to attend David Johnson's regular section hours. He is the only one in EC-10 who actually knows how to do things.","The course isn't that challenging and one will learn a lot of very good material","A class that depends on a lot on your section leader. Lectures are sort of boring. However, there is so much information\/course material to be learned - if time\/effort is put in, you'll come out of the class with a lot more knowledge than before.","it is hard and unless you really want to go into economics and are serious about it, dont take this class","I think if you want to learn something about economics and you don't mind problem sets, this is a good course to take. If you are interested in learning about economic issues in the real world, and you're not into problem sets, there are better courses to take.","Make sure to go to David Johnson's sections instead of your own- if you can. It's a big advantage","Take the class and pray for David Johnson as your TF, otherwise it won't be enjoyable.","David Johnson is your friend. Go to his office hours. He will help you. A lot.","study the helpful hints read the green parts of the book","This class is going to be a struggle, but it is a group struggle that really isn't too bad in the end. The problem sets may be rough, and the teaching may be spotty if you get a bad TF, but Ive compared what Ive learned in this class to my friends at other colleges, and it is a joke how much more we are doing than they are. Many of the topics that we take for granted after midterm 1 for the second semester are not even covered in a standard intro Ec class, and it makes you realize how valuable Ec 10 is to your total understanding of the United States. After completing the entire course, I really feel that i am comfortable with the economy in general, and now I can read Newsweek articles and completely understand what the hell they are talking about.","Take the class if you want a very comprehensive course on economics but be prepared to really do a lot of learning on your own.","This class is a really good taste of economics. You should take it if you are trying to decide if economics is the right concentration for you, it will certainly help you figure it out. However, if you have a superficial interest in economics and just want to learn something that could be applicable to real life I would suggest taking a different course for example a General Education course in Societies of the World etc because there is less of a focus on the details of economic theory and more of a focus on real world applications and implications which may prove more useful in the long run.","The course is very segmented, with not enough overlap and reinforcement in concepts between section, lecture, textbook, homework, and tests. A lot of work is left to the student, which I found very difficult. That said, the class gives a good overview of the economy, which is a useful skill. I would take this course if you wanted to know about the economy - otherwise, don't bother.","this class is a lot of work. Expect a solid introduction to economics. You will have to memorize and apply many models and equations. Memorization is not enough; the exams are structured such that you will need to apply what you learn, often in a new way. Section leaders vary greatly and that can have a big effect on your learning. Definitely a class you need to actually do the work for. Psets are long but manageable.","This class is a good overview of economics, but it definitely took some studying throughout since I had never had an economics class previously. It's frustrating at times but I'm still glad I took it and was opened to this field.","This isn't an easy, or necessarily enjoyable, class by any means, but I honestly think every Harvard student should take it. Ec 10 provides you with the basic knowledge about economics you need to understand today's economic and political climate and form rational decisions.","Don't take it just because you think that you have to take Ec10.","You might think that since Ec10 is popular, you should take it.  You might think that since most freshmen take it, you should take it.  You might think that if you want to know about economics in general you should take it.  You might think that since you need to fill an economics requirement you should take it.  DON'T TAKE IT.\r\nThis course is horribly designed- it is embarrassing to Harvard that this mediocrity is acceptable for the biggest class of its biggest concentration.  By far the worst class I have taken at Harvard.  Take Critical Economics with Marglin, read Wealth of Nations in Social Studies, but do not take this course unless you want to go into finance.","This course teaches important principles that are good to know even for students who don't plan on concentrating in economics. It will help students better understand current economic events. Also, the course isn't a lot of work and is fairly easy.","It's very difficult to learn everything you need to know from the class for the exams. A lot of the questions on the exams require synthesizing the material in ways that the class does not neecessarily cover. Getting a good TF is also incredibly important and incredibly difficult.","It's all interesting stuff. It's a very difficult way to learn, though. You have to be a committed self-starter and practice the homework\/reading EVERY day.","It was well organized and coming from no economics background, I found that it catered to my needs nicely. The professors and TFs are quite accessible if necessary","Pretty painful if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a freshman, but only because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge freshman class. Use the Helpful Hints, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re what the tests are based off of.","This is EC10 (not CS50). If you want a large class that is also a \"quintessential\" Harvard class and is run well. EC10 will not fit the bill. Take CS50; you will thank yourself for the favor later. EC10 has its place in attempting to describe our world and empowering us with theories as to how to explain the apparently inexplicable, but this course is just so unbelievably bad in its execution. To use the terminology, there is a severely inadequate allocation of resources here - little to no effort is given in ensuring the uniformity of sections. And, as a result, you could end up with an incredibly foreign TF who cannot speak English well at all or even begin to explain basic Economics, while the curve is at the mercy of those who are in sections with TFs who know how to teach. I have no doubts that all the EC10 TFs understand the material to a very deep extent, but a TF understanding the material alone DOES NOT CUT IT. One MUST be able to ACTUALLY teach the material, as well. It does us no good if a TF has a PHD in Economics but can barely formulate an English sentence to explain what they know, now does it? If you want to be a stereotypical Harvard student and follow the Econ route like everyone else, this is the place to start if you did not have access to AP Econ in high school. Otherwise, I would advise you stay away.","Ec10 teaches you so many important things but you also have to take initiative in order to get a lot out of the course.","Take Ec 10 if you're interested in the material, not if you're looking for great teaching, because it is the most inconsistent teaching experience you'll ever get at Harvard.","The material that this course covers is very useful but I would not recommend that future students take this course if it is not relevant to their respect fields of study.","lol Ec 10.","In order to do well, you have to read the textbook on your own time.","Studying economics is the most important thing a Harvard student can do.  It defines our own lives, our careers, and most importantly, American policy.  Please take Ec10. Everyone should.","Be prepared for awful TF's","I honestly loved Ec 10, especially second semester (macroeconomics). It wasn't always the easiest course, but it was a great balance of difficulty and learning. I feel like I got so much out of this course, and my only regret is not taking it earlier (I took it as a junior).","This is a course that makes you think a lot about economics. Don't think this will be easy because you did AP Econ. Micro is manageable with the AP knowledge, but you really need to study for Macro. Be careful about the wordings in the exams.","DO THE PRACTICE TESTS. (and the Unit Tests) otherwise the exams will shock you.","Your experience with this class depends entirely on the quality of your TF.","Take this class if you want a good general introduction to the class.","It's definitely something you need to learn at some point of your undergraduate career","pretty useful for life","This class is a solid, straight-forward introduction to macroeconomics, and I found it more interesting than microeconomics in the fall term because I could see how the concepts applied to U.S. policy issues today. However, be warned that your experience in this class will very much depend on the quality of the T.F. you get because almost all the material is taught in section. Mankiw only lectures 4 times a semester, and the guest lecturers are often important people, but they're usually hit or miss.","This class is not always fascinating and at times can be difficult, but it is really stuff that you need to learn. It's applicable both in your daily life (smaller-scale) and in the grander scheme of things (politics), and can help you really take a look at your views and back them up with actual understanding. Overall, I think that it's actually pretty interesting, but like any course, with its dull points.","This is a great way to learn more about economics, which is important for everyone to have some exposure to-regardless if you want to pursue a concentration or secondary in Ec.","Utilize office hours! TFs are extremely helpful and David Johnson is incredible. He inspires students and pushes them to see the applications of economics in current issues. I learned a TON from this course - you really get out of this course what you put into it.","go to lecture","For students without any background in Economics, this is a great survey course that fills you in on all the major points in basic Economics - so long as you luck out with good section leaders.","Its Ec10. you either take it or ya dont. but don't accept anything they tell you as absolute, positive, fact. That is bullshit.","Be wary if economics does not interest you.","The class provides a lot of great information. Not the most interesting presentation and kind of tedious, but worth taking.","This course is great if you have never been exposed to intro econ however the size and general layout make it a not so intimate learning experience.","This course requires a lot of work, especially if your TF is not to par","Take this course if you have to (concentration requirement). Other than that, unless you have a very serious interest in economics, I would not take it.","This is a poorly designed class. I definitely don't recommend it.","If your TF is performing poorly during the first semester, do yourself a HUGE favor and try to switch out.","David Johnson is amazing and economics is worth understanding. If you have any interest in economics, David Johnson is your guy.","Really interesting if you get into the material.  If you don't put in the work it won't make sense and the class will be hard.  Just do the readings","Material in ec10 is useful whether or not students want to go into economics and so it can be useful for anyone. Due to the size of the course, however, the overall experience occurs in sections and depends on the teaching style and capabilities of the section leader.","Don't take Ec 10 Macro without Ec 10 Micro unless you think you have an excellent grasp of the material.  It's not just about stuff you learn from the textbook, but also recent events and application of information in ways that are much different from many other classes.","Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.","expect to teach yourself the course material","It's not the best course, but introduction classes rarely are. Work through it and by the end you will have learned a lot, if nothing else.","its harder than you can imagine","This class is necessary, but is not the most interesting class you will take.","If you're an Ec concentrator you have to take it. Otherwise, I'd tread with caution. Learn Econ on your own over the summer, you're gonna be doing the same during the school year since section is little to no help.","Awesome course.  Textbook is expensive but extremely well written. Don't complain that Mankiw doesn't lecture often, because you wouldn't learn much with that kind of format. Take this before you graduate.","take it to learn about basic economics","Fantastic course that will allow you to understand how the world works much better than you did before. Even if you get a bad TF, you can still have a great experience and get an A if you read the books and the helpful hints.","Be prepared for a horrible experience but one that every miserable harvard student must go through.","You will learn a very simplified version of economics where everything is straight lines.","take Ec 10. you have to, it's a Harvard experience not to be missed","If you want to be an econ major, take this class. Otherwise, if you don't find yourself super engaged  with econ after micro, don't take macro.","Having never taken economics in high school, this class was somewhat challenging but ultimately pretty rewarding.  Take the unit tests; they really help both your grade and your understanding of the material (which, given the curve, are two entirely different animals).","This class is hard and frustrating, but so amazing to learn. The information will allow you to think in entirely new ways you never thought possible. The one piece of advice I will give: GO TO DAVID JOHNSON'S OFFICE HOURS ALL SEMESTER, and AS SOON AS THE MIDTERM REVIEW MATERIALS ARE POSTED. I cannot stress this enough. He shapes the course, and if you want to get an A in the class please use him as a resource.","People hate on this class a lot, but I enjoyed it a lot and found the course material very interesting. The only trouble is that having a bad section leader can really hurt or help you and that is out of your control.","The problem sets take a lot of time, but are very rewarding","Ec10 is a good introduction to economics.  It is definitely tricky, so it requires a lot of input of time to do well and really understand the course material.  I would definitely recommend taking advantage of office hours and coursewide review sessions.","Anyone should take this course, no matter what concentration or field of interest--Economics touches on everything... and ec10 helps open the door.","alot of work on problem sets and the exams are difficult but the information is worthwhile","Get a good TF!!! Don't bother reading the book, just learn the equations.","Necessary class to take, but don't expect much individual attention or good feedback.","This course is a solid introduction to economics. It's huge and Mankiw could really care less about the students. Nevertheless if you want a general background in economics, you should take this course.","Although there are definitely some things which can be changed about this course to make it more engaging and less similar to a high school course, i'm glad that I know macro.","Try to keep up with all of the reading. The class seems really hard unless you are caught up with sections.","A lot of work and will need a tutor","learn the material somewhere else","Ec 10 is interesting in that it successfully introduces an important subject and way of thought. However, the course something much to be desired, because it is taught almost entirely in sections run by TFs.","The class is challenging but you do learn a lot and have fun along the way","Just go to whatever section is best- the decrease in your section grades will  be outweighed by the positive effect of being taught by a TF who knows what they're talking about.","Great introduction to the basic tools of economic analysis","This class is kind of a hit or miss. People who have taken economics classes in high school tend to very well. If you are new to economics, it is easy to fall behind very quickly. Remember, some students taking Ec10 have already received 5's on their AP exams.","Just take it.","You will learn a lot of interesting things about economics. The problem sets are sometimes challenging, but they really do make you learn. The course is taught almost completely in section, but the guest lecturers are cool. Take the unit tests: it's my one regret of the year that I didn't take advantage of that opportunity. TF's office hours are also hopelessly important and helpful. If you are interested in learning a lot about the basics of economics this course is great. Sometimes, it won't be your favorite, but it is an informative learning experience.","Although some say that it is okay to skip right over to the 1010 or the 1011 series, Ec10 offers rudimentary overview of the most principal ideas in economics. Even with this knowledge offered in class, students can gain understanding of how economic policies affect society. Ec10 is a classic Harvard experience and David Johnson makes it so much more relevant! A Must-Take!","I didn't like this class as much as micro. That said, this class is still something valuable to sit through. It's important to understand what GDP is, what short-term effects government policies have on the economy, why the government passed the stimulus bill, etc. No, this class wasn't the most fun I've ever had, but yes, do take it, because you learn some valuable info. :)","Not a good class to get you excited about economics.","Make use of David Johnson's office hours as much as possible, and if you have a bad section leader,try to switch out immediately.","This class is like a really bad high school class. You have to take it, but try really hard to get a good TF and go to a good TF's office hours. Also, don't be brainwashed by Mankiw's conservative economics. This is just one side of economic theory and is not a science even though it is often presented as such.","Be prepared to put in a lot of effort on your own.  This class can be easy if you're willing to work hard.","Really interesting concepts. It's worth putting in the time. The class is not very well run though.","Don't expect this class to be the best class ever. However, the subject is very interesting and relevant to current events. Read the textbook and go to all sections. Also, read through the pset answers online because the entire class is basically \"guess what David Johnson is thinking of?\" David Johnson is terrific, though.","I really enjoyed ec 10 overall, and I think economics is a course that everyone should take during their time in college. In general, I think economics gives you a greater understanding of the way our world today works so that you can confront difficult and important decisions, particularly in the political or financial realm, with greater knowledge. Also, I enjoyed the information I learned in this course and found it to be not only useful but interesting.","only if you want to do economics","The Professors and TF's dont care about you and try to crush you on exams","This class is a little dull, but necessary.","Know that you're taking an Ec course.","EC10 is an effective introduction to economics and its way of thinking. The course brings in a star-studded cast of lecturers whose enthusiasm ranges from infectious to missing-in-action since the Reagan administration. Unless you have an excellent section leader, i.e. David Johnson, or are fascinated by economics, the course is mundane. The assignments are painless and the exams test understanding and intuition more than content knowledge. Get your intuition right and the course will be a breeze.","as a freshmen, consider waiting till sophomore year to take this class","This class may seem somewhat daunting but the awareness that you get about so much that is going on in the economy will help you in any concentration here or any field outside of Harvard.","The material is important to know, but if you're taking it as someone who probably won't pursue economics any further, there are other courses that teach this subject matter in a better way.","Every student should take the full Ec 10 sequence; it's useful and full of things that are good to know.","You can't really get out of taking this course if you are at all interested in economics, but it's not that difficult to get through.","You'll learn about econ, but it won't be pleasant (unless you get into the one section that is taught well). It's a solidly mediocre class, but it fulfills a lot of requirements.","This subject matter is important, but in some ways it is presented too much in a vacuum in Ec10. It becomes much more interested when given some context.\r\n\r\nSection was not helpful and but for my TF taking attendance I would not have gone.","--","Really great at teaching you some fundamental concepts (externalities, trade offs, value assigned) and also has allowed me to actually understand financial and economic analysis in newspapers etc","Honestly, you're better off with 1010b.","I dont know many people who got A's without having taken AP Econ. This isn't that difficult a class; there is just a lot of information. Go to lecture, pay attention. Dont copy the p-sets, it will bite you later. Very applicable and interesting information.","just pay attention, take good notes, and read the book. you'll be ok.","You know what it is","It's worth it to take ec10 to have a basic understanding of markets and the Fed and the economy but I didn't find the material particularly riveting.","- Useful basic knowledge that everyone should know.","only take this class if you want to have a basic understanding of economics or for concentration requirement.","It's Ec 10. You'll take it regardless of anything written here. Welcome to the Harvard tradition of thinking inside the box (cash box).","not bad at all","Second semester is not as straightforward as first semester. The concepts are a little more fuzzy as even economists have not come to a consensus on some of these topics. However, it is a very useful course to help you understand many of the economic policies around the world today.","don't freak out, enjoy the learning and the curve will help you out","This is pretty solid and interesting class. The actual work and tests are a little annoying, but you'll learn a fair amount and come out a more well-informed member of society.","Very difficult, prepare yourself for a grind","You really should take Ec before you enter the real world, the class teaches you a lot about it. It's designed for freshmen so pretty much everyone can handle it, and I found the material interesting. Section is a waste of time if you have a bad TF, so I guess try and get a good one? Lectures aren't great either but the tests and psets are actually pretty good at synthesizing (get used to that word) the information.","This course is hard, the work often tedious, and sticks to models which you may or may not agree with or believe correspond to reality. That said, most people will learn quite a bit about the economy in this class, and if one works hard, I think that one can learn a lot of interesting, important things.","It's not worth the general education requirement, as useful the information is.","Microeconomics sucks, but Macro is pretty cool and relevant.","this is a very interesting class. You will learn a lot but you must be ready to work for it!","This is a good intro class if you make full faith efforts at doing the problem sets. Otherwise, the section component of the class on its own is not enough to learn economics.","Stay with the readings","Don't get behind with the material. Otherwise, it's a great class that you will learn a lot from starting at any level.","The macroeconomics portion of Ec 10 is a valuable course which expands on a lot of the topics presented first semester.  However, the course is disorganized.  As such, you will have to teach yourself most of the material, particularly if you have a bad TF.","Entirely depends on how good your TF is. Lectures are usually quite interesting but they don't always directly apply to the things that you are learning at the moment in section.","It's not too hard, especially if you took economics in high school. Just study and every lil' ting gon' be all right.","This class gives you a very good background in economics.","You'll learn a lot of interesting information in Ec10. Definitely know that they will ask specific multiple choice questions about the lectures (I didn't know that originally). The tough part is that even if you feel like you understand the material backwards and forwards you could get to the test and feel like all questions are coming out of left field. Sections may add to confusion rather than help, but the reading materials and problem set answers give you most of what you need to know.","Well, it's Ec 10. I certainly think the class could be taught better, but it's worth learning economics in a general sense.","Don't expect to be blown away, but it's a solid intro course. Easy to get B range, hard to get A range.","You should not get your moral values from economics. Use economics to best apply your moral values that already existed.","I feel like a more informed citizen with a fundamental understanding of economics, understanding not simply what decisions the government and Fed make, but why they make those decisions.","Ec10 is a great class to take as a freshman. You meet a lot of other freshman and you learn things that are extremely applicable to real life. Especially during an election year, knowing economic principles is very important. It is not a hard course.","Take this course if you have any interest in the social sciences. Actually, pretty much everyone should know the fundamentals of economics, but the course itself is unfortunately subpar.","Ec10 is an important class to take if you haven't taken econ before. It's a great intro course that has many guest lectures given by other professors in the economics department and so that provides a glimpse into the professor's teaching styles, etc if you want to pursue further courses. It is true that the class depends on the section leader you get because much of the class is taught in section.","Still math phobic, but even less rigorous. Most of the equations seem arbitrary, and the conservative bent is more pronounced.","Good general knowledge to have and you find it either really suits you or doesn't.","Find a good TF. If your TF sucks, switch. If the one you switched to is worse, ignore them and go to David Johnson's sections.","take it only if you have a strong interest in ec and you like math","its hard","I feel that this class is most likely a class that you will not enjoy taking, but it is a class that you will feel greatly expanded your knowledge base.","Fairly boring, but effectively teaches the basics of economics.","Unless you really dislike big lectures or economics, I would highly recommend this course. The teaching quality can be hit or miss (depending on your TF), but the knowledge you gain is invaluable in understanding how the world works and how we can change it. Even if you don't plan on becoming an Economics concentrator (I'm certainly not), I would still recommend taking this course.","Although it is a large class, I found the lectures to be really interesting and the content to be extremely useful.","Typical big, intro course. Problem sets are pretty hard though","I mean, it's Ec 10.","Economics has changed the way I understand the world. This course is not taught perfectly--anyone can tell you that--but you will never forget what you learn, and you'll be glad you took it.","It is a must take while at Harvard","Ec 10, particularly the macro portion, is really helpful for a general understanding of the way the economy works.  The second semester is much more interesting than the first semester, so if you didnt like the first semester, stick around, it will get better.  The lectures were much better second semester.  The tests were harder, but you learn a lot more.","The subject matter of the course is truly valuable and interesting, the way it is taught is far from optimum.","The Spring part of EC 10, Macroeconomics, provides a solid foundational understanding of macroeconomics, including the historical narrative of macroeconomy, current economic policy, and the theoretical backbone of the course. Unlike micro, all of the components of macro seem to fit seamlessly together into a larger trajectory. Though the course is not without its problems, it is solid and recommended.","You just have to take it to move onto more interesting economics.","I would say that it's an interesting class that is probably one of the most applicable you can take at Harvard in terms of taking lessons learned in the classroom and transferring them to the real world.","The entire course is taught in section. So your section leader ultimately makes or breaks how enjoyable the course is.","Not worth getting through as a gen ed requirement, unless you're really striving to be an investment banker.","Everyone likes complaining about Ec10, and you will too, but take it. Very useful, maybe a little boring or frustrating at times, but all stuff you should know.","If you want to be an econ major you have to take this course, so just suck it up and get it over with.","Tough, frustrating at times, but rewarding.  As a senior science concentrator, I decided to take Ec. 10 as my one and only ec course. While I walked away from the class having learned a great deal, I had to put in a lot of work. Your TF and the amount of time you put into studying are the two factors that will dictate your success in this course.  This course isn't easy; you are required to apply economic principles at a higher, more detailed level (which at times, seems stupid and useless). If you're interested in taking an ec course for fun, look elsewhere.  But if you have the time and are willing to put in a lot of hours, then this course is for you.","It's a solid introduction to mainstream, neoliberal economics. But it also leads you to think that there are no other alternatives to the most widely held theories. Expect normative arguments to be dressed up as scientific facts.","Macroeconomics is somewhat different than microeconomics, but don't underestimate it. It's less mathematical (?) but does require you to keep more concepts in your head at a time that you will synthesize.","Read the book!","This course is brutal because of the workload, class time, and ultimately all that is taught is theory.  Only take this course if you have to for an ec concentration.","Ec 10 is a class that everyone should take because the material itself is something that we all should know. That being said, the class itself is not easy nor perfectly run - the problem sets are extremely time-consuming (the readings don't really prepare you to complete them).","Only take if you are considering an economics concentration or secondary","This is a very useful class, but will be challenging.","Graded very hard. Hard to tell your grade in the class.","Ec 10 is a good introduction to economics. Every student should take it before they graduate.","harder than it looks","The course moves very quickly, we do a new chapter every section, with three sections a week, and the chapters in the textbook are fairly long and take a while to read and comprehend, especially if you want to take notes as I do. This makes it incredibly easy to fall behind and catching up in this course can be very difficult. This course consumes so much time that it can be hard to balance with all of the other courses you are taking. Exams seem to go above and beyond what we have learned and having read and understood the textbook is not nearly enough. Even when I studied I never felt prepared for a test. Problem sets make Thursday nights long and miserable. The only good thing about this class is the curve that saves your exam grades. I will say, however, that you do feel like you learned a significant amount by the end of the course when you read an article or hear a news story about the economy and understand it.","helps you understand what's going on in the world. helps you read the newspaper. take it.","This course is difficult, and the support system is not the best. Though the course requirements were well explained, not much help was given in accomplishing them. In particular, the problem sets were very difficult and required information that was rarely given in class.","You have to take Ec 10 in order to take any higher level econ courses. Unfortunately, it's a mediocre course. If you're interested in econ like I am, I'm sorry but you're just going to have to slog through it... There are more interesting courses awaiting in the future.","This class really changed the way I think about  a lot of real world issues like the financial system and my own money decisions. It's a great introduction to economics and it will be really useful to you in other classes and your life outside of Harvard.","The TF's are almost all awful. Mankiw rarely lectures. Most of the guest lectures are boring (though occasionally interesting) and David Johnston (the most promising part of the class) really only has contact with you twice a semester unless you're in his section.","If you are interested in Economics, this course will give you a great introduction.  I can open the paper and read and understand almost any article about the economy.","if you want to take it","I appreciate that I learned a lot about economics so that I feel more comfortable talking about the economy in its language and vocabulary. However, I did not like the way the course was taught. It is too big and it all depends if you have a good TF because the lectures are not very helpful in learning the information. The exams dont really test you on the information you learn in section","Don't take this class unless you are going to concentrate in Ec","this course is a great way to learn some basic economics- something that everyone should have a familiarity with. however, there are some discrepancies in the course that can make your experience better or worse.","Course experience and difficulty varies widely according to which TF you get.","In Ec10 you definitely learn some very important fundamental economic concepts, which will serve you well as an informed citizen even if you don't take any more economics classes.","Great course. Take it even if you think you will never use economics ever again.","I think that like most classes your good understanding of the course is dependent on how you are taught and on your own initiative to learn the material.","I took this course, because I think it's useful to have a basic understanding of economics.  This course gives you just that.  You will probably find this course annoying at one point or another, but it's not bad and is useful in providing the basics of economics.  Make sure in Macro that you pay attention in section and lectures, because a lot more questions are taken from sources outside of the book than in first semester.","This is a great class that will help you the rest of your life. Don't listen to those who whine about it. Yes, its a hard class. But its worth it.","The course moves very quickly. If you like economics and find yourself not liking it in this class, don't be discouraged from the economics concentration because disliking the class is pretty common.","Don't take it unless you are seriously thinking of concentrating in economics. The class is poorly put together. I'm glad I took this class because it showed me that I should not concentrate in economics; the department must be bad to have such a terrible intro class.","This is not law. Take everything with a grain of salt and do your own research.","Take advantage of office hours.  Understand how to work every problem on every problem set.  Learn why things make sense -- not just how to work specific problems.  If you do these things, the course will be a breeze, and you'll learn a lot of very useful tools for understanding how the economy works.","It's really good for you to learn how to think this way.  The first semester is better than the second semester.  Take the Unit Tests on time.","Mankiw never teaches. The section leaders are either great or awful. Prepare to pay over $150 for a book and teach it to yourself because exam questions involve a whole lot more than what the book tells you.","Read the textbook.","This class teaches you a lot and in the end I am glad that I took it, but it was a struggle all the way throughout. I had no background in economics whatsoever and very little knowledge of current economics in the world, both of which really held me back. The most frustrating part of this class is the TF problem. If you get a good TF you will do well in the class (if you try). But if you get a bad TF you won't do well even if you try really hard (unless you already have a background in economics).","You know what to expect if you took the first part of the class. Problem sets and exams are about the same length and difficulty. I think macroeconomics is inherently more interesting than microeconomics because it involves more policy, but nothing in here will surprise you. This class has surprisingly little overlap with AP Macro - that class will make this one easier, but it is still worthwhile to take this class.","Your experience will depend a lot on who your section leader is.  It's not fair at all but what you get out of this course is kinda luck of the draw since most of the course is conducted in section.","Good Class - but it all depends on your TF","EC10 is a necessary class, but not one that anyone relishes taking. Listen closely to your TF, since he\/she will be the decider of your grade in the class. Also, think critically of the materials being \"proved\" to you, since they are often still hotly contested economic theories.","Look, it's not the best-run course, but if you haven't taken any Econ, you should. It's just...kinda important to know.","To incoming freshmen considering taking Ec10: THINK IT THROUGH. Don't take this course unless you are SERIOUSLY considering concentrating in Ec. The course is poorly taught, the exams are difficult, and the course overall is just extremely frustrating.","On average, considering both the micro and macro semesters, this course is mediocre at best. It is NOT enjoyable and the course is very badly managed. Almost all the TF's, from what I have gathered from others and personally experienced, regurgitate the textbook without question. Your grades on assignments (mostly exams actually) depend upon whether or not you think along similar lines as David Johnson (the head TF and writer of exams\/homeworks), not necessarily whether or not you studied\/know the material. And the official graders sometimes have no idea what they're doing. Feedback is not simply bad, but truly awful: they'll mark off tens of points for simple errors (including algebraic errors!), refuse to read paragraphs of explanation, get confused by fractions\/percents, rarely write anything meaningful on your paper aside from checks and X's, and will sometimes (though less frequently) mark correct answers wrong. What keeps this course going may be the interesting content, but even this can occasionally be obscured by the lecturers' boring droning or - even worse - the condescension and superficiality of their discussion (e.g., the lecture on tuna fish sandwiches attempting to justify privatization, which possessed NO hardcore evidence and was literally laughable in its content and presentation). The lectures, the textbook, and the scripts that TF's blindly follow are quite biased in favor of some kind of conservative agenda. For example, look at the unusual discussions of minimum wage, unions, taxes, healthcare, the government, social democracy, welfare systems, etc. In taking this course, you SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT accept all the material as fact - take everything with a grain of salt and challenge it (do your own research, read OTHER ECONOMISTS' positions, etc.). While on average I said the course appears mediocre, in my personal opinion, it gives Harvard a bad name: it is by far the worst course I've taken at Harvard, both in terms of management and the inspiration of its students, as there are many people I talked to who feel left behind, unheard, or altogether disenchanted from the study of economics. This is clearly not fair - and something needs to change!","Make sure to keep up with textbook readings, they really help!","Good introduction to macroeconomic theory if that interests you.","This class is long, and at times frustrating, but still worthwhile, even if you aren't going to concentrate in economics.","Keep up with reading.","Only take it for one reason: if you want to major in economics and need this requirement. Do not take it for an intro to Econ (micro is better for that), an unbiased survey (it leans far to the right, as Mankiw worked for Bush), or an engaging lecturer or section. It is a shame that Harvard misinterprets the popularity of this course as a vote of approval for the poorly run Ec10.","Mankiw needs your money from textbooks to buy himself another Mercedes. The class is poorly taught because it completely relies on your TF. The lectures are interesting and insightful, but Mankiw is very stubborn and only teaches what he deems important. The tests he writes are extremely difficult and test whether you can see through a myriad of information, rather than if you can solve economic problems.","If you have no background in economics, this course can be useful in providing basic intuition for future classes.  Unless your math is extremely good, I would recommend that you take this course before jumping directly into a higher economics course.  It can seem a little high school at times, but it's a pretty good standard introductory economics course.","This course is very useful and you learn a lot. But a lot of time is needed to learn the material and be ready for tests","It's a classic class, a big machine, but it gets the job done.","Yes, it does help you gain a deeper knowledge of economics, which helps contextualize current events. But the psets and sections are uninteresting.","Well worth the effort. You learn a lot.","Only take this class if you know that you will be dedicated to learning the information. It is very easy to get behind and never really catch up.","The class is a necessary evil if you are interested in economics. It is your only option. Otherwise, I wouldn't take it.","The information you get in Ec10 is stuff that everyone should know. Lectures aren't terribly exciting and often repetitive. Ec10 really holds your hand and walks you through everything--with Unit Tests, etc, getting an A should be fairly easy even if you don't have ec background.","Ec 10 is a good class to take if you are interested in Economics, but if not, it is a terrible experience and is not very interesting.","I think everyone should take Ec 10.  It is extremely relevant and necessary to understand.  Plus David Johnson is the best!","This class is essential, mostly everyone takes it.","Overall, Ec 10 is a fantastic class, with interesting and very relevant material. I believe it is very important for every Harvard student to learn the basic economic principles taught in this course. The class is taught in section (it would be absolutely ignorant to argue that Mankiw should lecture the material - students wouldn't be able to ask questions and students would be lost). It is a very large class, and as such, it can seem daunting sometimes to find help - BUT - TFs hold office hours every week (many times before the problem sets are due) and David Johnson is an absolutely amazing teacher - GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS, and to his review sessions before every exam. Take advantage of Mankiw's office hours as well. Most TFs are good teachers, but you will be expected to synthesize the foundation you receive in section with lectures, problem set questions, and exam questions. It is likely that you will never have seen an exam question before that night, but you will have the tools necessary to answer them - I learn something new every exam! Grading is fair - one-third of the students receive A\/A-, and two-thirds receive B-\/B\/B+. You should be prepared to spend 4-6 hours on problem sets, and additional time reading and studying, but if you put in the effort, you will leave will a solid knowledge of intro economics. I highly recommend this course for anyone, whatever your concentration.","This class feels different for everyone, but at some point it will definitely be challenging. It is very worth taking for the value you get from learning concepts that apply to, well, the economy we live in. You will certainly better understand the terms thrown around on the news.","Take Econ. It's the most applicable class you will have ever taken , and you know nothing about the economy from high school. This class will teach you how to read about the economy, and how to participate and contribute in discussion of the economy.","Take this class because you practically have to, but don't really expect to enjoy it.","Ec 10 is a weed-out class. Do not take it as an elective. It is very demanding and can hurt your GPA. You will get as much out of it as you put into it.","If there is one course you should take, it's Ec10. Its real world applicability is priceless. All the economic\/business news will actually make sense. You'll also see how utterly ignorant politicians are when it comes to economic issues.","it's not easy, but good things in life don't come easy","it is hard. you will hate it. but it is good information everyone should learn.","Take this course. It's not very hard, but it will change the way you view the world.","I would say that Ec10 is one of those courses that is popular for a reason, but you may want to really ask yourself if you really want to take this course. While I feel like I've learned some great things in this course, there were times were I felt like I could have just taken a few other different courses in the Ec department, especially after I realized that I didn't want to be an economics concentrator. \r\n\r\nIn short, if you need the course for some requirement, suck it up and take it and it's not that bad. However, if add\/drop time comes around and you aren't feeling the course anymore, I would suggest that you at least consider dropping the course. You will also probably need to look intently for extra help if you need it.","So I think there should be two versions of this class. One for people that find the concepts discussed in the class interesting and want to learn more about how they apply to the real word and one that covers details and specifics of graphs and stuff like that for people who actually want to concentrate in EC (or know that they are good at it). I think this class tries to strike a balance between those two, but fails. The lectures seem disjointed and like an entirely different class. Section covers the hard ec concepts and basically ends up being GRAPHS, GRAPHS, GRAPHS. Note to freshman: you don't have to take Ec just because everyone else does....","This class is very predictable and structured, and I really enjoyed it because my TF was good and I was genuinely interested in economics. However, for students who do not care for economics and prefer a more discussion-based introduction to economics, this class is not enjoyable.","I think that if you are at all interested in learning about macroeconomics, this is definitely a class that is worth taking.  It probably won't be your favorite class because it's not like the material is extraordinarily fascinating and you don't really get to talk to the professor unless you really want to.  But, it'll get the job done and it won't be not enjoyable while it's at it.","I had some difficulty with the course because it wasn't very interesting and presented some very complex concepts, but it still gave me a lot of valuable, practical information.","It is all on your own. You need to do the work and you need to attend lectures and sections.","Definitely a good start and overview of the basic concepts of economics. A class everybody should take regardless of its size and flaws to obtain an insight into economics and how markets work.","Big class that everyone takes, but it's a great class that is highly applicable to everyday life and the workload is definitely manageable.","Your interpretation of this class will be heavily determined by your section leader. If you don't have a super on-top-of-it section leader, this might be a hard class for you. You should expect to study a lot on your own to do very well. There is not any personal attention in this course, so you have to be okay being independent to enjoy the class.","It's a well-run course which covers interesting material. Take it!","Ec 10 is one of the most popular classes at Harvard so be wise about how you approach the class and if you would like economics to be your concentration, it seems more like a weed-out class","Expect section to be fairly boring if a) you're not in David Johnson's section, and b) you've done the reading. That was me last semester. This semester I didn't bother doing the reading until after section, which is actually nice because there are some details that you don't catch in the book until you've learned the material once through. Additionally, guest lectures can sometimes be deathly boring, but make sure to try to take notes on them anyway because they may pop up on the exam (one free-response question, for example, was based on the position of a guest lecturer on a specific issue). Finally, read the helpful hints and do the unit tests. They're good review and sometimes the helpful hints really crystalize an idea explored briefly in section. If you have time, also read over answers to psets, because David Johnson is really good at expressing the logic you need to reach the solutions.","Know the concepts. Do problems","Somewhat boring, but the information is useful.","Ec. 10 is what you make of it. Don't allow yourself to have a bad experience just because you get a TF you don't like. There are a ton of resources you can use to supplement your Ec. 10 experience. For example, you can always go to different TF's office hours or even go to their section. I highly recommend going to David Johnson's office hours. That guy is ah-mazing. He's patient, funny, and engaging. He doesn't just answer your questions, he makes you think beyond your questions and have you relate them to current events. I learned a LOT by going to his office hours, even though I had a different TF. Plus, I recommend you read the chapter in the book before you go to section so you have a better understanding about what is going on in section :) Plus, the guest speakers  are the best in their fields and some give out pretty interesting lectures :)","If you keep up with readings and do all the review questions provided before exams, this class really isn\u00c2\u00b4t that bad! Also, it\u00c2\u00b4s hard to make it to unit tests sometimes, but I would definitely recommend them as good way to review course material and get to talk through concepts you don\u00c2\u00b4t understand.","Brutal class, but necessary if you want to do anything in economics. Good to have a base in economics so everyone should take it, but no one will enjoy it","You have to really want to do this and dedicate a lot of time to this class in order to take it.","Make sure to keep up with readings and go to lectures, no matter how pointless they seem. The course may seem easy because there's only one problem set a week, but the midterms and final all make sure you have a complete understanding of the material. Be careful.","This class provides knowledge about the world that every intelligent person should come to know and understand in order to make better decisions not only for oneself but for the country","Ec10 does a great job teaching the basics of economics. Even if you dont plan on concentrating in econ, these are concepts that are so important to learn just to follow current events! Take it!","Go to office hours with pset questions, that's the only way you'll learn anything not elaborated upon in the book. Section does not help. Prepare to be frustrated with the inefficiency of the class.","Don't take it for fun.","This course simply does not use enough math. Very infrequently is data used to back up the theory. Macro is better than micro in that more real-world examples were mentioned. The worst part of this course is the TFs. The TFs are sometimes good but most times really unsatisfactory. David Johnson is brilliant and excellent, so sneak into his section if you want to learn anything substantial. I would recommend reading a basic economics textbook over the summer, then taking Ec-1010 instead, as they deal with actual numbers and use calculus, which is a crucial piece of economics that Ec-10 failed to implement for fear of scaring people with no math background away. If you MUST take this course as a concentration requirement, utilize David Johnson, and try to think about how calculus will factor into the problems.","take this if you have to, not because you want to","It is taught horribly, but the subject matter is very helpful for understanding current events.","It's a good class and I think basic economics is something that everyone should know","Economics is incredibly useful. It's just something you should take because it will make you a better citizen.","Microeconomics is not only about how to be rich and manage one's money. For me it is also about philosophy that can be taken out of the monetary context, and it will still work. It is a class about real life. Macroeconomics is more policy oriented and is slightly more engaging for the reason of its high applicability.","Not for the quality of the course, just because the information is important knowledge for everyone.  David Johnson's office hours and review sessions were the only pedagogically successful part of the course.","You get an intro to econ. Pretty straight forward.","You should know what you're getting into - Ec10 is another one of those large, lecture-based classes where you get very little individualized attention. It truly matters what TF you get - it changes your whole experience. Additionally, you never really see Mankiw - he lectures maybe 5 times the entire year. Unless you go to his office hours, there's really no interaction. Most of your learning will come from going to David Johnson's review sessions and doing the problem sets he writes.\r\n\r\nAlso, the curve for tests is pretty large - you can get a 80\/120 and thats an A-.","This course provides a fundamental introduction to Economics. I had never taken any economics before, but was always curious. I feel much more knowledgeable about Economics and can live my life with an Econ eye. However, the structure of the class is very tedious\/annoying. I'd recommend taking pass\/fail if you can to avoid unit tests and stressing out so much.","Take this course, but take it with a grain of salt.","One of the few classes at Harvard you absolutely must take before you graduate.","The second semester of Ec 10 is both easier and more interesting than the previous semester","This class teaches you so much about the world. I feel like I just understand the financial and political worlds so much better now. Definitely a class you want to take, even if you don't plan on going into the business world. It is just a good skill set to have. And there is always a nice curve on exams.","Do all unit tests and for sure go to office hours. Especially with David Johnson. Also DO THE PSETS. Makes life easier when you actually work through the problems instead of cramming","Don't expect to come away with anything that you can apply to the real world.","It can be a lot of work, but is not that bad. Go to David Johnson's Office Hours and thrive.","I had no economics background and I really enjoyed learning the basics.  That being said, macro was kind of hard for me and unit tests are annoying.  Psets aren't bad though.","Ec 10 is harder than it seems, especially Macro.","I mean, it's Ec10, it's not the greatest course in the world, you take it because it's introductory economics.","You learn the basics of economics--but I feel that there might be better ways to do that. \r\nIf you don't get a great section leader (e.g. David Johnson), the experience will be pretty boring, I say. I have some regrets not doing Ec1010 or some more engaging class instead. But with relatively easy workload and focus on theory, this may be better for folks who just want that \"background\" knowledge on economics.","it's an intro course.","Everyone should take EC 10.  It really reshapes the way you think about a lot of things going on in the world.  The problem sets can be a bit tricky, and they tend to throw curve balls on the midterm exams.  The curve is pretty generous, so don't worry.  If you get stuck with a bad TF, go to David Johnson's office hours!  This class really helps you have an informed understanding of many current events.  T","The sections are terrible but having a general understanding of economics is great. I would take but they should make it entirely a lecture class and just have David Johnson teach it.","Good if you plan on concentrating in stat or econ.","Read the chapters, go to office hours, attend lectures and suggested panels, don't complain about the tests or p-sets and just do them, become friends with David Johnson.","Most useful class taken at Harvard so far! Sections are boring as ____, but you learn so much and it's really helpful","The class is rewarding, but it requires a lot of work.","I mean, you have to take it, so just grit through. Pay attention to David Johnson and try to get switched into his section because its unfair for the kids who arent in his seection....we're not used to his weird synthesis obsession.","You don't need to waste your time with this course to learn the principles of economics. I felt like my biggest mistake was taking this class. It dragged me down during the semester.","This is a class that is challenging but rewarding and I think all Harvard students should take it at some pont.","This class has a strong neoliberal\/conservative orientation (after all, Mankiw advises Romney), and the structure of the course (giant lectures, synchronized sections) discourages critical thinking or dissent from the orthodoxy presented. If you want to take higher-level econ classes, this is a necessary prerequisite, but take the course with a heavy grain of salt. If you don't think you will take more econ, I might take Marglin's \"Critical Perspectives on Economics\" instead.","Struggle through it","Honestly, although I hated the class, its very doable. I really enjoyed Ec10 a lot more than Ec10b. Anybody who tells you that Ec10b is easier, may have lied. They are probably humanities majors who couldn't do math in Ec10. If you understand graphs, you will do well in both semesters. Read the book BEFORE YOU GO TO SECTION. It will make life a lot easier, when you decide you should read the book after.","It is fundamental economics that is not too difficult to grasp but is a difficult course with all of the work. If economics is at all interesting to someone, this is definitely a class to take.","If you are not interested in Economics, this course might grind on you. It can be dry, and even boring at times, and the problems sets are tedious. That said attending David Johnson's office hours are tremendously rewarding and make the problem sets come to life. The more you see David Johnson, the better this course will be for you.","I definitely preferred the fall semester of Ec 10 to the spring semester, but macroeconomics is more applicable to the real world than microeconomics.  Not the most interesting course at Harvard, but one you should definitely take since every college graduate should have some background in economics.","Read the book. Super helpful. Go to office hours too. You will learn a lot from them and start psets early.","May not be the most pleasant, but will give you a strong understanding of macroeconomics."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Few people rave about Ec 10, but it covers important material, and when it sucks you get to complain about it with 800 other freshmen, so it's probably worth taking in spite of the inevitable bad section TF that you will receive.","be prepared to spend a lot of time on this course every week because it moves quickly","TFs leaders make a big difference. Some have never taught before so expect to teach yourself the course.","ec 10 is a great course! if you are interested in learning about how the US and world economies work, you must take this class to gain a solid foundation in the basic principles of economics.","Take this class if you're interested in economics, business, how markets work, or anything like that. It'll be satisfying, if you take it for the right reasons. If you take it just for a GenEdReq, then you might get frustrated and cynical.","It's dry at times, but it has basic knowledge that really everybody, concentrator or not, should know.","Be prepared for very difficult exams","The class is really great overall. The problem sets are the most time consuming component of the course, but they are also really valuable when preparing for the exams. The sections are mostly just taught out of the book, so it's really easy to keep up with the pace of the course.  If you make sure to stay on top of the readings, its not too bad.","I've never taken economics in high school, and taking this course made me think completely differently about the world. Some of my political views have changed because of what I learned, which I thought would be impossible. I love this class, and it was my favorite course this semester.","The majority of the material is self taught and not very interesting","meh.","The material can be dry, and the problem sets are challenging, but it's worth it to gain an understanding of economics.","Take it as it is a useful class, but know it is difficult and sometimes overwhelming.","Study for tests and hope for a good section leader.","Prepare to do learning by yourself or in a group.","Only take EC10 if you actually want to know economics.  The material is dry and problem sets can be time consuming and annoying. It often felt like a class I wasn't getting much out of, even though I know that I'll appreciate it later on when I take more interesting econ classes. If you're just doing it for a US and the World credit, I would suggest taking something more random and interesting.","Make sure to read the book and pay attention in section. If you do that, the class won't be too difficult. Also, try going to the lectures because questions are sometimes taken from them.","It's Ec10!","It's really hit or miss, depending on your past experience and the TF that you get.","If you want to know anything about economics (which I think is useful for people who have an interest in politics or government or anything regarding how countries work), then you should take it.  But don't expect to be blown away.","There are many components to this course, and so it requires a lot of time.  Problem sets can be especially time-consuming.  The course does require careful thought and can be difficult if one is not used to thinking like an economist.","It's sometimes painful, but it's great to be able to look at things this way","Take it to get a basic understanding of economics, or if you want to take higher level econ classes","The homework takes a long time, so you should space it out along the week. The tests are very doable and are curved. As long as you turn eveything in you should be fine in this class.","While this is a good introduction to economics, it doesn't seem to be quite as applicable as I had hoped. Also, we discuss very theoretical aspects in section which can be challenging to apply to the situations on the problem sets.","This is the basic economics course to take. It's not terribly exciting, but it's useful if you are planning on (or even just thinking about) concentrating in economics.","A necessary evil. Great material to learn and very useful in the real world, but honestly I would rather have just learned the material online and not in a classroom setting. Section is rehashing the textbook and the problem sets take forever. Go to David Johnson's review sessions because that's the only time you will actually learn economics.","While not administrated and taught as well as everyone would like it to be, Economics 10 is still very useful and applicable. The material is not easy, so with consistent work students can learn a lot even though the experience may not be...fun.","Definitely read the helpful hints, the optional readings are rarely tested but are interesting, ATTEND LECTURE because there are always some questions on the exams, and definitely go to the unit tests because they are free points.","It is tough and most of the time arduous, but it does give you a good base understanding of today's economy and the politics behind it. Also, it opens doors down the road to be sure.","Harder and more work than you think.","It's a good introductory course; definitely take it if you think you might be interested in Econ as a concentration. It might not be for everyone, and it's more math and graphs than I had anticipated.","Sometimes it is not the most engaging course, but you do learn a lot by the end of the semester.","If you're curious about economics, this course actually does a very good job of providing a fairly comprehensive intro to econ. It's not thrilling, glamorous, or especially challenging, but it's certainly not a bad course. Also, as a person who leans very far to the left, I didn't find the alleged conservative leanings of the course that egregious or one-sided.","its exactly what you expect","Ec10 is your basic econ class. It's something you have to take, and the material you learn is definitely worthwhile, but the format of the class prevents it from being enjoyable in just about any way. I would never recommend skipping Ec10, even if you aren't an ec concentrator, because you need a certain amount of ec knowledge to be an educated citizen, but the class itself won't be your favorite. My TF, Paula, was great, but not all students have a positive experience with their TFs, which makes it a lot harder. The material you learn in section and in the book is also very different than a lot of what's on the problem sets, and office hours are a definite necessity for some weeks. Lecture is also totally pointless \u00e2\u20ac\u201d your grade won't be any different if you skip, and Mankiw isn't very engaging when he's there. That said, if you've taken AP Econ in high school, Ec10 will be a lot easier, but you'll still learn something because the problem sets are a higher level than high school.","This course is average. It is taught almost entirely in section with a few lectures from Mankiw and different guest lecturers. Take the unit tests; they are a good indicator of whether you have mastered the material. The material is interesting, but the teaching isn't spectacular. The problem sets can be frustrating because they are entirely different from anything you seen in class, and it can be hard to figure out what the right approach is; ask your TF for help or else you may go off on the wrong track.","make sure you get David Johnson","At the end of the course, you will come out with a better understanding of microeconomics and it is significant. You should be warned that there are rarely any lectures and the class is taught mostly in section, but this shouldn't effect how much you get out of the course.","READ THE TEXTBOOK. ALL THE ANSWERS ARE IN THERE. And it's really well written.","Of all of the classes I have taken so far, I learned the most from this one. Yes, it is large and the experience depends heavily on the quality of the TF, but the book is easy to read, the assignments are well structured and I feel like I know much more about the world now than I did in September.","You should take it if you're interested in econ.","it's something everyone should take, but it doesn't mean that you will enjoy it.","EC10 is definitely a Harvard staple. It's a great way to be introduced to economics and understand how the field fits into the real world. The exams can be more difficult than expected, so watch out. Also, make sure you get a good TF and you will have a better semester.","The material is important to learn and the course is what I would consider a traditional fundamental course.  However, you should be expecting the class to be taught almost by teaching fellows, and you should also be prepared to learn a bulk of the material on your own.  I have found that working with a BSC tutor has been very helpful to close the gap between the what is taught through the book and section and what we are expected to know for the problem sets.","EC10 is a good experience to have, but unless you have a very good grasp of economics or you do a very large amount of work outside of class, you will likely feel that you don't understand everything.","Many people complain about the latent libertarian politics underlying much of the course material, but unless you're rabidly politically-opinionated, it won't bother you. Most rational people appreciate that Ec 10 makes many foundational assumptions with respect to markets and governments, and that no one is prepared to craft public policy just after this one course. Mankiw rarely lectures, but he's not that remarkable a speaker to begin with, and if you get a halfway decent TF, you'll prefer your TF to Mankiw. At least for me, my TF, Trisha, was nothing short of fantastic. She offered very lively, colorful examples in class and had no issue imparting her knowledge and keeping the class attentive and following her thoughts. The unit tests are brilliant - they ensure a deep knowledge of the material and give you highly useful bonus points on top of your final grade. Mankiw's textbook is a model for an introduction into an course. It is highly logical and intuitive and eases even a complete novice into the course with little difficulty. Take Ec 10.","You have to take it if you want to take more ec, or just to know anything about how the world works.","so many people take ec10, and with good reason. this course gives you a basic understanding of economics. only take this course if you truly want to learn about economics, there are a lot of readings.","Taking an economics course in college is almost a must. Ec10 itself isn't the most fun class you'll take here but it gets the job done. You'll be glad you took it. Start the Psets early.","Take this class if you want a basic knowledge of economics or obviously if you think you would like to concentrate in economics. I came here thinking I would concentrate in ec, but after taking this class, I'm not so sure I feel as strong about that anymore. Don't take this class just for the math gen ed requirement, and don't take it if you just want to take a big popular class.","Be prepared to have to figure out a lot by yourself.","Great introduction to economics","This is a great introductory class to economics. Background in high school AP Micro is a big advantage. Though it is challenging, the class is doable with hard work.","If you have to. You have to.","It's a good class to get the basics of economics, but make sure to keep up with the course readings and lectures. Also, go ahead and take the unit tests if you can!","Take this class! It teaches you to think logically!","Make sure to read the chapters from the book to stay up to speed with the class.","I took AP Economics in high school and so I thought that this class would be relatively painless, but nope, it was basically my high school class on steroids. The psets are incredibly time-consuming and stressful, especially when you put them off until the night before they are due. The midterms are ridiculous, but the curve is a life-saver. I would say that the one thing that is truly wonderful about Ec 10 is that it allows you to meet lots of freshmen since loads of people are taking it. Study groups are the best!","Not an easy course, but worthwhile to be an educated adult. The problem sets are challenging but very accurately represent the material covered. Exams are tricky but very manageable if you review and understand the problem sets ad provided review materials. Well organized and thought out course. Must get good section leader though","It's not the best taught class but you do learn about economics.","Do your psets early in the week and stay on top of your readings. It will be 100 times easier that way (trust me I learned the hard way). Also go to office hours, David Johnson's especially.","Do the readings, go to section and all the review sessions and all the unit tests. I did not always do this and it came back to bite me pretty hard.  You will have a much more pleasant experience if you do.","The great thing about this course is that you're going to walk out of it and understand a little more about what you read in the newspaper. But there are major setbacks in the way that it's taught (which isn't really their fault, since the course is so big), so you're going to have to put in a lot of individual effort. Don't worry too much about the hard p-sets and midterms\/finals: if you put in at least the right amount of effort, the curve will take care of it for you.","Go to every section.  You won't regret it.","Be prepared to read","Keep up with the texts so section makes sense; lectures are not entirely necessary; DO THE UNIT TESTS!","Ec is a class that everyone should be required to take, because of the nature of the subject matter and how applicable it is to everyday life, both on a personal consumption basis and when observing larger economies and political implications.","Take this class with the understanding that it's dry, time-consuming, and that the tests are very challenging. If you have to take it, you have to, but this class is not fun. It's also very orthodox - it's Adam Smith kind of stuff, and I was very frustrated that it was so math-focused based on all kinds of generalizations about human nature. I had a lot of trouble just taking everything at face value, and there's not a meaningful part of the course that allows you to engage with alternate understandings of economics besides Mankiw's conservative conception of it (aside from the occasional, very interesting lectures). For the most part, everything stays in the abstract in this course.","This class is just a standard econ course. You could probably do well by reading the textbook and helpful hints. It is, however, not an exciting course. Although the course incorporates introductory presentations from the fields such as behavioural economics, they are not the primary components of this course. Most of the times you listen to generic section teachings and reviews of generic neo-classical economics material; and worse you listen to Mankiw's uninspiring and sometimes frustrating lectures. \r\nOne would hope that by taking this course that one could gain a better understanding of this world and better service and improve our world. The course gives a very logical but simplified version for the first and makes no attempt at the second. It talks about the economic discipline as it is but not its possibilities; it does not challenge you intellectually but merely forces you to believe in a theoretical model. This is a standard course for economics; it makes no attempt to inspire change and betterment of the world via economics and makes meagre attempt at making economics interesting. If there are more lectures then perhaps it could be more interesting, they are however of only meagre component of this course. It is a pity that harvard has a course like this. Nevertheless, you gotta take it: it is econ and it is the pre-requisite to a lot of fields. My comment here will only tell you what to expect, but not influence at all your decision on taking this course.\r\n\r\nI do, however, recommend going to David Johnson's review sessions. He is a much better lecturer, and makes you think objectively but critically on your given theories and models.","It is a very useful course, and although it can be hard at times, hard work is also rewarded.","always try and work on your pset with a section leader or a friend","Your teaching fellow in this course is very important. Also, do not hesitate to go to David Johnson's office hours. He is the best resource of Ec 10.","Students' experiences in Ec10 vary based on the section experience. I had David Johnson, and if you get him you are set. The course will be interesting, and tied into all the big issues that world leaders address on a daily basis. There is work. There is reading and studying. But its worth it. If you are interesting in business, politics, news, or just about anything take this class. It may be annoying, but its a must.","This class helps you to understand the world.","Good into class","Well, you have to take the course if you want to be an Econ major.","Make sure you have a good section Tf, it can make all the difference. People get frustrated with this class because the exams are hard, but they are based on pset type questions and not the simple examples used in section so be aware of this. It's a good intro class and really does provide a lot of good foundations for economics. I am not an economics concentrator and took this class my junior year which I would recommend as I felt I was well prepared for the difficulty and enjoyed it.","While the problem sets and exams are demanding, if you're at all interested in economics, you really must take this course. There is a fair amount of work involved but the material is super interesting and is made for those who have little to no prior experience in economics. Also, your TF will really make a difference. If you don't have a great TF, section will be a drag","Make sure to keep up to date in textbook reading. If you fall behind you'll have a lot of reading to do in a short period of time to catch up.","Although it is not always rewarding, this course is definitely worthwhile. The material is extremely relevant, and the textbook is well organized and should be read carefully. The textbook, however, is not sufficient by itself. Read the Helpful Hints, attend section, attend lectures, and take the Unit Tests. Ec10 can be frustrating at times, but in the long run it should be a positive experience if one puts the effort and time in.","This class is difficult, know that you may need to put extra time into the problem sets as the semester continues.","Take Ec 10. Everyone should have an understanding of economics. You don't need to be a math whiz or even good at math (although some basic familiarity is helpful), and you definitely don't need to have any experience with economics. The experience does hinge a little bit on how good your TF is because so much of the class is taught in section, but if you luck out and get a good one, it's a great class.","Ec 10 is a highly debated class. If you have a hint of doing some sort of economics, take this class. If you want to learn how the world functions in general, take this class. This, along with LS1A, CS 50, Gov 20, constitutes a basic intro class. Also, David Johnson definitely does make you think along the economist's line of thinking, so in daily life, you will be able to apply many of the econ theories in practice.","Your TF determines a lot of how this class turns out for you. The lectures are fascinating and David Johnson's OH are very much worth it, so if you decide to take the class, don't miss out on its very best components.","It is a very interesting course and the material learned is worth-while. It is a great introduction for people no matter whether they are considering a concentration, secondary, or not. You get what you put into it. Don't expect to learn or get anything from the course if you are not willing to put in the time on your own to do all the readings thoroughly and the psets with individual care and attention.","This course gets a worse rap than it deserves. Granted, your experience in the course is almost entirely dependent on what TF you get, but if you put a lot of work into it and don't just do the psets the night before you'll get a lot more out of it.","unlikely to recommend","The class material can be difficult but if you dedicate yourself to the work you can do just fine in the class.","Very difficult if you are not great at mathematical thinking","A classic freshman class, I took it as a sophomore to get my US-World Gen-Ed requirement out of the way. Even though, Mankiw barely teaches the class, if you have a good TF you will get a good enough understanding of Economics. Try to take notes on the chapter before section and find someone to do problem sets with!","Ec10 is a class that students should take whether or not they're thinking about concentrating in Economics, because it teaches skills and information that are applicable to daily life. Although the p-sets will definitely require much more time and effort than you'd think, the way the course is designed (with sections, office hours, and reviews) allows plenty of opportunities to ask questions. It's nice that there is no calculus involved (especially if you dislike math), but there are definitely parts where math is heavily used. You should take it, but don't expect it to be an easy course!","Read the textbook before the section is taught about it, and stay up to date with chapters, required readings, and helpful hints so you do not have to learn it all in a condensed period before a midterm or exam.","Its a pretty generic class where the textbook does not equal the problem sets or midterms at all...","There are so many misconceptions of Ec 10, lots of it splattered all over the Q-Guide, that I would like to put it a voice of reason.\r\n\r\nMany students' complaints of Ec 10 lie along the following lines:\r\n1. Ec 10 is too hard (or easy).\r\n2. Ec 10 is poorly taught. Mankiw rarely lectures and the TFs are awful.\r\n3. Ec 10 has a conservative bent; do not take the material in Ec 10 at \"face value.\"\r\n\r\nMost of these criticisms (many extremely negative) of Ec 10 are not founded on much fact or reason. In response:\r\n1. I have taken AP Economics, and it appears to me that Ec 10 is not significantly more difficult than the material presented in the AP curriculum. I can see why many students struggle with Ec 10, especially those learning economics for the first time. Some can legitimately call Ec 10 \"challenging,\" but to say that Ec 10 is extremely grueling is a gross exaggeration, perhaps one made out of spite. (Those who find Ec 10 too easy or not mathematically rigorous enough should honestly take 1010 or 1011. Come on.)\r\n\r\n2. Yes, many TFs are not the best, and Mankiw rarely lectures. For these reasons you might not give Ec 10 a 5\/5 in terms of teaching quality, but students should understand that this is one of the realities of a course that has been designed to accommodate more than 700 students. Given the constraints of administering a course of this size, it is difficult to imagine how Ec 10 could be improved that much. The textbook, whether or not it matches your personal learning style, is acclaimed and (at the least) can be called \"decently written.\" David Johnson is a fine head section leader (who responds to questions very quickly) and writes good course materials.\r\n\r\n3. Despite my center-left\/far-left political orientation, I can say with confidence that Ec 10 is fairly impartial. A couple points are in order. In light of the past controversy surrounding the course, Prof. Mankiw has taken a great deal of effort to distinguish the core analytic concepts of economics (\"positive economics\") from the value judgments (\"normative economics\"); in this regard, there were several lectures that touched on various viewpoints in economic policy and political philosophy. To many, the concepts in Ec 10 probably simply appear to have a conservative slant simply because the vanilla version of introductory economics concepts---deadweight loss, to take an example---seem to advocate for free-market solutions. Liberal-leaning students who don't really look beyond the most trivial implications of the basic models of Ec 10 seem to want to misrepresent Ec 10 as a conservative propaganda machine (at one extreme).\r\n\r\nIn all: Ec 10 is a solid, well-designed course. The teaching staff are, at the very least, adequate; the course materials are effective; and the exams and problem sets are fair and effective teaching tools.","Economics is an amazing subject as always, even though the conservative, Republican attitude taken by Mankiw is OK. David Johnson, the head  TF, is an amazing guy and the best person to go to with questions, better even than Mankiw himself. He knows the material, and explains it really well. Your luck is based on which teaching fellow you get. You get a good one, good! You get a bad one, very very bad! Anyways, always go to David Johnson's Office Hours and do all the work you have to do.","If you enjoy economics, this course will be exactly what you would expect.  If not, stay away: it will make no attempt to appeal to you.","Overall: The class is great. Definitely a class you should take to complete your \"Harvard experience.\" and I think everyone should have at least this baseline knowledge of Economics.\r\n\r\nLecture: Interesting but irrelevant to problem set questions or exam problems. Mankiw's an interesting guy, but you won't see him very often, so don't take this class because you think you'll be taught by a famous professor.\r\n\r\nSection: Like other large classes, definitely hit or miss, but it does define your experience. I had a decent section leader, but I did the majority of my learning on my own or in David Johnson's office hours. If you go to those, you will learn economics and have a good time.\r\n\r\nProblem Sets: Time-consuming but definitely worth it. They make you learn economics.\r\n\r\nExams: David Johnson is incredibly talented at making straightforward economics challenging on the exams. He throughs curveballs at you that you should be able to handle if you have \"synthesized\" the information. (That seems to be his favorite word).","Take it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the best classes at Harvard.","I think this course is important in becoming an informed citizen of the world. With that being said, it's a fairly decent time commitment. It also reminds me why I'm not a huge fan of big intro classes. I think those two things are necessary evils, though, because the return on your investment is pretty big (HA).","You may not necessarily need it, if you've studied economics before. The exams can be a pain, and test you on general nitty gritty concepts.","If your brain enjoys math, visual pictures and money, you may have found your academic home in Economics 10. If you struggle with basic arithmetic, get lost in acronyms and get little lines mixed up, run for the shelter of the humanities, take a semester off, or simply go crying to Dean Dingman.","It gave me a better understanding of how the world works. I'd take it.","take a year of economics in high school to do well","Really interesting!","You should take this class to get a basic knowledge of Economics in your head, but it is such a boring and hard class.","It's useful information and worthwhile.","You should take this class if only for the classic Harvard experience. I personally loved this class- it really changed the way I look at the world. I'm now considering economics as a concentration when I thought before I was for SURE going to be MCB. It's a fairly moderate amount of work and you definitely don't need any background in economics. If you've taken AP, you should probably try to get into Ec1010 because this might be a waste of your time.","The class is definitely not easy, but a lot can be gained. Exams are fair, but the problem sets are lengthy.","Don't do it. When I enrolled against the advice of my older friends, I figured, \"How bad can it be?\" It's pretty bad. Busy work, the problem sets aren't on par with what is taught in class, and Mankiw just profits from our textbook money.","If you've taken some form of econ before, move on to 1010 or 1011.","It is a lot easier for the kids who took Micro and Macro Economics in high school","It gives you a great understanding of basic economics in the world.","Ec 10 is the opposite of fun. Every time I worked on a pset, a piece of my soul withered away. Don't take it because you think it's a right of passage and because it would be good to have an elementary understanding of economics. If you care that much, just read the textbook on your own. Don't put yourself through the mind-numbing torture that is the section-pset-unit test machine.","Solid course","It's a good, solid class.","This class has some essential knowledge that I find important for everybody's career and although it has is cons, every one should definitively take.","The work for this course is much more difficult than what you learn in class and read in the textbook.","Economics is a very important subject, and the material taught is relevant.  However, there is a HUGE disparity among the quality of the TFs - and some of them are simply a waste of time.  The tests do a very poor job of measuring achievement, and instead expect ridiculous extrapolations and illogical applications.","How well you do on this course will depend greatly on the TF that you get. If you get lotteried into David Johnson's section, then good for you. But if you get put into a course with a TF that merely spits back to you information you can readily learn yourself from the textbook, then you will most likely get little out of section and miss out on a lot of the economics intuition that other people may have had the chance to obtain through their TF. In that unlucky case, raid David's office hours because they are really useful.","It's a really great beginner's introduction to economics class!","This class shows you a side of business that you might not have known existed.","It's good to know some economics. Take this class.","Anyone with half a brain should take this course to understand the economic principles that govern our world. Very useful and applicable in everyday life and financial decision-making. Tons of real-world examples. Despite what people say, the course is not biased; it gives you the straight-up facts and truth of economics. Guest lectures are amazing and useful. You will be a much better, more informed consumer and citizen after taking this course. Don't listen to the complaints about getting a bad section; all you need to do is read the book, all the info you need is there.","Your Ec 10 experience depends largely on your TF. Some are great, others not so much. My advice would be to go to David Johnson's review sessions. They might not be that helpful, but they're pretty entertaining. Seriously, just go to one.","This course is hard.","Depends on what section leader you get. I had an amazing one, and I felt the class was a snap. Don't get dragged into the \"THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!\" aura that is often put off in the yard - escaping that by taking this as a sophomore, I realized how simple everything was. Learn things logically; don't just memorize facts.","Do not expect a fun, beginnings Economics course. Expect to learn basic concepts in section, struggle for hours through problem sets, dedicate entire nights to Unit Tests and still do poorly on exams. Also do not expect to ever see Mankiw. The course is run by David Johnson and your TF puts in all the work.","I can't tell anyone whether or not to take this course. It was very so-so. I believe that I learned important information, but the design of the course is frustrating. Ec10 is extremely impersonal; there are very few course wide lectures, and when there are, they are on tangential topics. Your entire Ec10 experience depends on your TF. Definitely recommend with reservations.","I can't think of many people \"crazy\" about ec10, but it's definetely a useful class. If you plan on taking any upperlevel economics classes, this is a required \"gateway\" class and does a good job of getting you to start thinking like an economist. Even if you're not planning on being an economics concentrator, you'll likely appreciate it anyways because it explains the mechanics behind tax systems, health care, etc aka topics pertinent to everyday life","You learn a lot, but it is hard work.","Ec. 10 is a necessary evil. Not really designed for beginners but the course content is so important that you really should just suffer through it anyway. The problem sets will be painful but if you work at them it translates pretty well to the exams. Without office hours I probably would've had some problems due to the fact that a lot of the questions require serious synthesis, you can't just study and \"get\" it.","Ec 10 is truly an introduction to economics. It provides a solid foundation to any study of economics, but it is not always the most personal class. Section TFs can be a toss-up, but David Johnson, the head section leader, is a really amazing teacher. I would take this class if you haven't ever taken economics before, but maybe look for some smaller, higher-level classes if you are looking for more!","I would tell them that although it is economics and not math, this course has a lot to do with math and they will deal with a lot more numbers than on any other econ class.","Tough class, but necessary for concentration .","If you have a good section leader, the class teaches you a ton of important material that will be useful no matter what field you are in. The class also gives you tons of support to make sure you're learning the material","Solid class, not going to blow your mind with how awesome it is, but if you're interested in Econ in the slightest Ec 10 gives you a good opportunity to learn a lot.","Ec10 is a course every Harvard student should take.  It's a right of passage.  It's a prerequisite for many economics courses, and it's important for numerous concentrations.","time consuming for problem sets but problem sets prepare you well for examinations","The material taught in Economics is not just useful for those pursuing it as a concentration - it's useful in life. The department connects the concepts to social issues very well. It's also not so much about memorizing small details, but more about understanding general concepts and being able to apply them to problems. You never do \"busy work.\"","Go to office hours, and start problem sets early. Also, do the review problems provided before each exam.","Not my favorite class, but it taught me sufficiently what I needed to learn.","It's a great class for life in general!","If you're a freshman who has no idea what you're concentrating in, take this course.  Not only does it give you a solid foundation economics, but it makes you a better analytical thinker.  While the teaching ability of your TF will vary, David Johnson is the man, and make sure to attend his review sessions.  This is his course, and he knows the material extremely well.","go to other section leaders' office hours","Being able to understand our world through an economic lens will always serve as an invaluable ability.","This course is good for gaining necessary foundational knowledge but the structure isn't set up very well.","It is an okay class.  The guest lecturers are probably the BEST part of the course.  Get a study group together early so you have people to work on psets with.  Tests are kind of hard, but the curve usually helps you.  All in all a decent course.","Psets can difficult if you don't keep up with the readings and you don't go to office hours.  GO TO OFFICE HOURS","Do not take this course unless you are interested in economics. Taking this course for any other reason will make your life miserable.","Stay up on your work. Don't procrastinate","This course gives a good foundational background to microeconomics. The grading for homework is subjective according to the section leader. The section leader can make or break your decision to continue with economics.","You have to be very interested in the course to do well since it is a lot of work and an intensive course.","If you want to learn basic Economics, take this class.","Take it if you want to be an econ major. Don't take it if you want to learn a little economics to better understand the world- not worth the trouble.","Take this course. Its a good intro to ec and is not too difficult.","Read chapters in the book and attend lectures.","Lots of people complain that Mankiw only lectures 4 or 5 times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's for the better.  He's not a particularly interesting or engaging lecturer at all.  The guest lecturers, on the other hand, are great.  Section leaders all seem to grade their PSets differently, which needs to be addressed.  Some use check plus plus, some don't, some drop the 6th pset, some drop the 7th, etc.  Your success in this course is dependent upon your upkeep with the textbook (which isn't too bad if you can stay on top of it) and going to see your TF during office hours for help with the PSet.","10a can be very very boring, but make sure to stay engaged and do the unit tests.","The TFs are awful across the board. Also, Mankiw is one of those asshole professors who can't be bothered to lecture his own class more than once a month. Instead, he brings guest lecturers to do his job. BTW, Fryer is a bomb-ass lecturer.","This class is only good if you get a good TF.","Keep up with your reading and stay on top of your work rather than saving the problem set for the night before its due.","Ec 10 isn't easy, but after the first semester I feel as though the work I've put into it has been worth my while. It also isn't impossible to do well in the class! The bonus points from unit tests can really help out - so don't let fear of getting a bad grade keep you from taking it.","This is a great course to introduce you to the field of economics. I took AP Economics in high school and still have benefited greatly from this course.","Of course it is not easy, but it is worth taking. I took this as an elective my sophomore year, and even though I am not performing to the standard I set for my other courses, I am definitely glad I took it. It's simply worth knowing! Word to the wise -- you learn the material by reading the textbook, the helpful hints, and by doing the psets. Lectures and sections just regurgitate information, though some guest lectures are particularly fascinating.","Ec 10 does have its rep of being disorganized, right-winged, and lacking good TFs but I think these criticisms are more exaggerated than reality. Yes, this course has a huge enrollment and it's difficult to find the personal attention you want but you end up learning a lot on your own. The actual content of this class, I feel, is essential to understanding current real world problems and how the world works in general. I personally was someone who knew nothing of economics or policy before entering this class and while I'm far from being an expert, Ec 10 did a great job introducing me to the basics. Now I'm glad that I at least have an idea of what they're talking about when they discuss economic policy.","Don't fall behind on your readings, and do every problem on the psets even if you have a group. It'll be so helpful at exam time!","be prepared to do a lot of your work on your own and to teach yourself, furthermore be aware that most of the course consists of section - lectures are EXTREMELY infrequent","The information from this course is very interesting, and I feel I have truly learned intuitively the basis for economics.  That being said, this course requires dedication to master the material.","keep up with the readings, it will make studying for exams much easier","Great class even if you don't want to concentrate in economics.","This is a tough course that will challenge you but with the right amount of dedication and hard work, you can still succeed.","This class is structured very well and there is a lot of help available. I never studied this topic before but it was alright for me because there are a lot of help such as office hours, review sessions, and practice tests. My section leader was incredible so I learned a lot through section and through reading the book.","This course can be hit-or-miss depending on your section experience. While ec 10 is important to take if you're interested in or intending to concentrate in economics, you will likely not enjoy it as much as your other courses. Section can be pretty boring, the p-sets are tough, and the course moves pretty fast.","Ec10 was enjoyable. Take the unit tests, they definitely help cement your understanding. I heard some TFs weren't great, but I learned a lot from mine.","The level of teaching and instruction is decent for a 600-person course, but if you really want to make the most out of EC 10 be sure to go to your section leader's or David Johnson's office hours.","This class will give you a good foundation in economics, but if the field is not something you are seriously interested in, do not take it. It isn't worth it.","The class itself is much harder than one would guess by simply showing up to section and doing the readings. Make sure to do every problem in each problem set by yourself, and take your time on every problem - it will pay off well.","This class seemed rather dreadful in the beginning, but as the semester went on it became more interesting. I became better able to apply what I learned to what I was hearing in the news, what I saw companies doing, etc. Everything started to meld together and make sense. Two tips: 1) Get a good TF. It doesn't have to be David Johnson, but make sure it's someone you can understand. 2) If you get lost (like I did at one point), READ THE TEXTBOOK! The lectures can be boring sometimes (they get better as time goes on as well) but I'd still recommend this class.","This course gives you a solid grounding in economics which will serve you well regardless of whether or not you plan to pursue higher-level courses.  However, be aware that you will have to slog through semi-degrading unit tests and potentially useless TFs.  If you're really dedicated to learning economics (or if you're really dedicated to fulfilling your concentration requirements), then you should bite the bullet and go for it.","If you get a good TF this class is a breeze. Take the unit tests they help you estimate how well you understand the material even if the points dont do much for your average. If you dont want to study ec, dont bother with this class.","Getting a good TF in this class is key; reading the textbook is also key. The exams are quite difficult, but the course is curved, so everyone ends up doing pretty well. I would definitely recommend taking this as a freshman if you are interested in the slightest. Overall, a great course.","It is what you make of it.","If you have any interest in Economics, even if you do not, the information you will learn in this course is extremely valuable to be a knowledgable citizen.","The class is challenging for some, but will help me a lot in the long run. It was a very good overview of the principles of economics, but there was not much time spent with the professors themselves.","Definitely a class that needs to be taken during your four years.","Get a good section head. It makes all the difference.","Ec 10 is not an exciting course but is a necessary step for taking future courses in economics; therefore it is unavoidable. Luckily the class is well organized. The problem sets are reflective of what are on the exams. So the class is fair.\r\n\r\nMost of its weaknesses is due to the fact that it is an intro course. You do not learn enough tools to be able to apply them to the greater world. Although the instructors do make a point when a lesson is applicable to something, this rarely happens. The problem set sometimes trivialize the economic theory. The problems concerning consumer theory (how consumers weigh costs and ultimately what they want) generally had a consumer choose between coffee and donuts. If the consumer had to choose between health care and basic food, doing the problem sets would have more meaning and discussion value.","You'll never see the professor. Get a tutor.","It is a lot of work.","I found this class irritating and often haphazardly run. Take this class as a freshman if you're really interested in economics and\/or need it for a concentration requirement. Otherwise, wait until later and consider taking it pass\/fail.","Take the unit tests and read the helpful hints beforehand. Work on problem sets in groups.","Put a lot of effort into it and it will be very rewarding.","I would tell students to go to the guest lectures-- they can be really interesting! I would also tell them to work with a partner from their section on problem sets, I found that to be really helpful in thinking through and talking about the material. It certainly enhanced my understanding of the material to discuss it and work on it with others. Also, I would recommend office hours with your TF, they are very helpful and with my TF they were even fun!","Good class for economics majors.","It's too fast-paced for an Gen-Ed course.","Ec10 is not perfect, but it's really not bad for an intro class.  The problem sets have a couple of pretty tough problems, but they're doable, and there are various forms of collaboration that are allowed so you don't have to do them on your own.  The textbook is great for a basic understanding of concepts, but you really have to build your own understanding of them beyond that to be able to complete problem sets and do well on exams.  All in all, it wasn't the best of classes, but I did enjoy it, and definitely plan on taking more economics classes as a result of having taken it.","Read before the tests","I would tell them that this course can help you understand the world around them and they should take it regardless of their concentration.","be prepared to teach yourself everything in this course. good luck","The class has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the teaching fellow makes or breaks the course. Make use of David Johnson's office hours. Economics is exciting when he talks about it. It isn't always.","The sections in this course (which is pretty much most of it) teach you little more than the textbook will.","Ec10 is a decent introduction to the basics of economics, take it but keep an open mind--stay skeptical, and build on what you learn, don't take what they teach you here as the ultimate truth.","good class. can be boring at times.","Pretty much you have to take it, but it's very unorganized and if you want to learn anything without having to teach it to yourself David Johnson is the only one who can help you.","it provides you with a useful background in ec, which i think is important for any student, regardless of concentration","Take this class. It's a no brainer. Very important, major real life implications and it's extremely important to be informed on this material","I would take this only if you want to concentrate in economics","Ec 10 is a good course for getting a solid background in economics. However, the discrepancy between the difficulty level of problem sets and material from the book is quite stark. It definitely would help to have a background in economics, but even if you do not, you can do fairly well in this class if you put in the work and utilize TF office hours.","If you read, go to section, do the problem sets, and study for the tests, the class is not very difficult.","get a good tf. mankiw lectures are bleh.","Having never taken economics before, I found this class to be a bit challenging; that being said, it is a solid intro course and one that you should take if you want some sort of econ background.","Very interesting material, PSETs are time consuming, go to office hours","really the only way to get into economics at Harvard; it's not that hard, but problems have hidden quetions in them so you need to learn what the TFs are looking for","Ec10 gives you a solid grounding in the fundamentals.  It is not a difficult course, but it teaches principles that everyone would benefit from understanding.  Lectures are usually okay, the book is an accessible tool, and the small number of problem sets are not too tough.  Unfortunately, experiences vary widely because the course is primarily tought through section, and quality of section leaders is uneven.  I would offer a moderately enthusiastic recommendation for Ec10 to all students.","As someone who has never studied economics before, ec 10 opened my eyes to some really interesting science and got me interested in economics.","I would definitely recommend this class. Economics is a life skill that will help you understand markets and help you make decisions in life everyday.","The quality of the TFs is extremely low and you will end up having to teach yourself most of the material.","If you're interested in it, it'll pay off. If not, it's not really worth doing.","The political slant is hard to stomach, but the course itself is easy enough.","Very good survey of critical topics to economics at an intro level if you are thinking about concentrating in the subject or merely want to gain a better understanding of the world.","you should definitely attend section if you want to do well","Ec 10 does what it is supposed to do very well: it is a very good introduction to the fundamentals principles of economics. The problem sets can be quite time consuming, but they will make you think deeply about the course material.\r\n\r\nThe guest lecturers are terrific. Your experience in the class will probably also depend a lot on your section leader. David Johnson, the head TF, is a fantastic teacher: make sure to go to his review sessions and office hours.","This course is taught in section. Lectures really just offer interesting information that is related to the course material but not covered in the textbook. Therefore, you want a good TF. If you're not happy with your TF, try and switch into another section early on in the course. Overall, a very good class though. Very useful, practical information.","This class is interesting and worth taking if you are interested in economics, but the class is much more enjoyable if you have been introduced to economics in the past and you have a good TF.","Ec 10 is HUGE (>700 students) but great. The lectures show you several examples of how economics is applied to real life from varied perspectives (of people who are renowned experts in the field). The only thing I have reservations about are the TFs - you're randomly assigned to a TF, and if you end up with one who doesn't teach very well you could have a bad experience (on the other hand, if you end up with David Johnson you are one very, very lucky student!). That being said, though, there are a  lot of resources you can take advantage of - I would recommend READING THE TEXTBOOK, in my opinion it's very well written! Make sure you stay on top of the reading and weekly problem sets (psets usually took me 3-4 hours, on average, so not too bad) - it also helps to do the entire pset on your own (rather than split it up in a group) because they are very similar to exam questions. Also, David Johnson's office hours and midterm\/final exam review sessions (especially the review sessions) are magical. Go to the three REVIEW SESSIONS! This introductory class has really opened my eyes to the pertinence of economics in daily life and decision-making -- if you haven't taken economics before in high school you should take Ec 10!","This course is incredibly slow and Mankiw's lectures are both rudimentary and boring. Some of the guest lecturers, however, are wonderful speakers and present complex and interesting subjects. I found section (at least my section) to be a waste of time, as it simply presented the concepts from the chapter of the book we were supposed to read. There is really no point in reading the textbook if you go to section.","You learn a lot of basic economics from this class, and the textbook is very accessible.  But this is a large class, and the bureaucracy of it can be frustrating at times.  Also, if you have a strong math background, you will probably find section to be a bit of a drag (everything follows from what is in the textbook, which you will likely pick up quickly).","If at any point you begin to suspect that your TF is hurting you more than helping you, do whatever you possibly can to switch into another section. Teaching Fellows are not made equal...","Good to take if you are thinking about concentrating in ec but for people wanting just a basic knowledge of the economy it might be a bit too much detail (I still enjoyed it though. lectures were very interesting, and they can be audited without taking the actual course though)","I really liked Ec10. This class is highly dependent on your section assignment as it is where most of your learning occurs. I had a wonderful TF who taught the material thoroughly yet clearly. This course is so important because it teaches you important concepts in economics that are vital to know. This course provides you with many opportunities to engage with the material, from problem sets, to optional unit tests to midterm tests. This class covers a lot of practical information that can improve your understanding of economics and finance.","Solid course","Don't take this class unless you have to. The quality of the TFs varies a ton, so if you get a bad one, you are in trouble.","I loved my TF, so I enjoyed going to section and felt like I really learned a lot. The lectures are rather rare, but they were usually interesting. The guest lecturers were excellent, and we got to hear about a wide variety of topics within economics. The PSETs weren't terrible, though they do require some time. The exams will throw a curve ball or two, but they're manageable. I feel like I learned a lot, and the class moved at a good pace.","Go to office hours because they give good help on psets and help to solidify your understanding of the material.","If you're taking it as an elective\/for fun take it pass fail. Definitely still worth it though!","Economics 10 is one of those courses you have to take in order to get to higher level, more interesting economics. You should take it so you can understand higher level economics better.","Keep up with work and really understand the Psets. As a sophomore, I really appreciated understanding some of the social applications of economics before trying to motivate myself to learn the material, but the course provides some similar insight into econ beyond wall street.","pretty basic intro to econ, but be ready to but in the time week after week on long p-sets...also if you're at all considering econ concentration take this as a freshman!","Get ready to read a lot, teach yourself a lot, and commit time to this course","quality of course may depend heavily on your TF","This class is no-frills but satisfactory. Appropriate workload. Dry, but useful and thorough.","My TF, Anne Le Brun, was awesome. She's really the best. People say David Johnson, is awesome, but when I went to his review sessions, I just felt like he was yelling loudly and going too fast. Most of what you cover in section is in the book, but there are like 10 concepts that you need to go to section for. Coming in as a science concentrator taking this class just to educate myself on basic economics, this was a fairly painless, pretty predictable class.","This class is taught entirely in section, and some of the TFs are far inferior to others. Most likely, you will need to teach yourself the material by reading the Mankiw text.  Lectures are the only bright spot in this course, but they are few and far between.","Ec 10 is the kind of class that opens doors to more exciting and less frustrating courses, so it is worth taking.","Not too bad, but PSets are kind of annoying, and what's on the exams aren't really taught in class.","Be prepared for a few relatively boring lectures and learning everything in section. Your section leader will really make or break your experience in Ec10","I think I've gotten a lot out of the course, but its a lot of work and often very frustrating. The test questions, the pset questions, and the unit tests are very very vague and that makes it frustrating because on top of understanding the concepts you have to dig through the language and try to figure out what they're really asking.","It is certainly a worthwhile class as you will see many common-sense principles shored up in a quantitative manner.","You should definitely take Ec 10 at some point during your time at Harvard. It covers a lot of information that is simply useful to know.","While the content and skills learned in this course are quite useful and applicable, I would only take it for a letter grade if you are taking the course for concentration or gen ed credit. The exams are intentionally made needlessly complicated and difficult, and the course does not provide answers to the exams you take, which makes it difficult to learn from your mistakes on the exam.","It's like a shot, it's something you've got to do even if its a bit painful","This class is really what you make of it. If you get put with a bad TF and don't ask to be switched, if you get behind on the reading, if you wait until the last minute to do the problem sets, then this class sucks. But if you get put with a good TF, if you do the reading on time (and discover that Mankiw is actually really good at explaining things in writing), and if you start your problem sets early in the week and go to David Johnson's office hours (where he explains things really well in person), then you can really get inspired by economics. As a first-semester freshman it took me too long to realize this and I suffered from it. It's really David Johnson who runs this class, not Mankiw or the TFs; he writes the problem sets and the tests, so get to know his style and practice his problems, not textbook problems.","You're at a disadvantage if you've never taken Economics before, but if you haven't taken economics, you seriously should take Ec10. Studying economics gives you the ability to quantitatively understand ideas basic and central to common discussions of current events.","Be ready to have to put in a lot of time in order to do well.","It is hard.","I believe that enjoyment and success in this class depends largely on your section leader. Because this class has very few lectures, the majority of what you learn will be taught by your section leader. If you get a great TF the class will be a breeze. If you get a TF that is not great, this class will be much more of a struggle. Did I love this class? No. But, if you are an economics major you will probably have to take it. I do believe it teaches you a lot about economics, but how much you learn is based off of your TF. Do the readings because they will teach you stuff. Doing the unit tests and problem sets thoroughly is also important.","I would tell them that economics is a challenging course, but one that is very interesting. it pertains to our daily lives, and it is very beneficial to know about our economy.","Take this course!  Even if you think you have no interest in economics, this course will give you so much perspective and insight into how the world works.  It's a manageable workload (about 3 chapters and 1 problem set per week), and it's well worth the time.  Take advantage of opportunities to take unit tests and attend review sessions--these really helped me grasp the material and identify my weak points.","Don't take it with no intentions of considering economics as a concentration.","Although my experience this semester with EC10 this semester was far from pleasant because of my section leader, I cannot recommend a class with more enthusiasm to any one. The head instructor David Johnson puts a lot of effort into ensuring that students have the resources and materials available to succeed and benefit from this class. If you want to change your view on the world immediately then EC10 is the class to take because it can help you see the world through a different lens - an economic perspective. After being given the basic tools to analyze all sorts of policy in the modern world, I couldn't help but find this class a fascinating experience. It is a must take if you want to better understand firm behaviour, the labor market, consumer theory, and the free market!","Please avoid this course. It is horribly structured. In every other class, section is intended to supplement lecture. In Ec10, you learn the primary material in section, and lectures are a rarity. Since sections are taught by graduate students who often have little or no teaching experience, this structure results in an unacceptably inequitable distribution of teaching quality across sections. If you get a bad TF (you have no influence over this and can't change it), you WILL NOT learn the material. You will end up compensating by spending many additional hours doing the psets and at the office hours of other TFs. Do yourself a favor and take Marglin's \"Critical Economics\" class or the Kennedy School intro economics class instead. This is the worse class that I've ever taken at Harvard, and possibly the worse class I've taken in my whole life.","Ec 10 is Ec 10... the psets are tiresome and generally a lot of work (especially if you didn't take AP Econ in high school) but the textbook is great and there is a lot of help available if you seek it out.  Having a really competent section leader helps a lot too, as does taking the Unit Tests when they're offered (although timing can be a hassle if you have lots of commitments in the evenings).","Start psets early so you can go to office hours! Your TF will be teaching you most of the time, so it helps to have a good one and not be afraid to ask questions.","This class is awful-- it's too bad there aren't any other intro economics classes.","Ec 10 provides a firm basis in economics, a discipline that can easily be utilized in other concentrations as well. I am confident that I will continue to return to my Ec 10 knowledge regularly in my gov concentration.","It started off interesting, but then the course material became really boring.","If you want to concentrate in ec, it's just a course that you have to take","This is seriously the best class on campus","It provides important information, but it is definitely a challenge.","Knowledge everyone should have!","It's really great, just make sure you get a good TF.","This class is great if you want an introduction to economics. The textbook (which is written by the professor) is very easy to understand and teaches the fundamentals very well. Your section leader can vary wildly, but most are generally at least passable. And section doesn't feature that prominently on exams anyways. Exams are not difficult if you understand the material. Problem sets take a long time.","A lot depends on your tf...","Ec10 is your classic gigantic intro course. Your experience will solely depend on how good your TF is. You won't learn anything profound or intellectually inspiring but you will come away with an enhanced economic understanding of markets and society.","theres a lot of people who take ec10 with a lot of prior background, like already having taken AP macro and\/or micro. it was kind of unfair to those of us who have never taken a single ec class before ec10, but its possible to do well in the class anyway.","Quickly change section if you do not like your TF.","you better brace yourself, the exams are not that easy either","Come with a background in economics if you want to do well","If economics is something you are interested in\/think you're good at, this is definitely a good class to take, but otherwise might be pretty difficult.","It is hard, but if you like it and you're good at it, you will be fine.","good class, do your psets and keep up with the work and you will be fine","The main problem with Ec 10 it is that your actual teachers (section leaders) sometimes have a hard time teaching the material (whether it be a language barrier or just a lack of confidence).  That being said, I don't regret taking the class.  You learn how to work with your peers and learn the material outside the classroom as well.  Take Ec 10 if you're interested in the concepts, have an open mind, and want to look at the world differently.","Covers some things not covered in the AP curriculum like tariffs and indifference curves. If you've taken the AP and made a 5, you should take 1010 or 1011. Otherwise, it might help to make sure you've mastered the material before moving on.","It is good to know economics for your life. It is very interesting and helps make the news and politics make a lot more sense. I am taking it pass\/fail which was a good decision if you don't need it for credit.  I was able to learn the general points of economics without the stress of having to know every single little formula and graph.","If you get David Johnson, you will have the best, most unbelievably wonderful year with Economics EVER.","Be careful about what TF you chose.","It's Ec 10, there's not much more to say. It's worth taking if you want to learn economics, not worth taking if you don't (and don't have to). I'm taking it to fulfill my USW and I don't regret it, but I agree with the commonly heard criticisms of the course. I hadn't taken economics before and I don't go to section and just read the textbook, and I've done fine. Lectures are unnecessary (just read the slides before the tests) although sometimes interesting. The problems on the problem sets and exams are a lot more difficult than anything in the textbook or section; the best thing you can do to prepare for the tests (other than read the book) is do practice problems, which there are always detailed sample answers for on the course website.","It's definitely a topic that is interesting and useful for all students. It makes you look at the world around you in a different light.","It is a very good intro to economics, and it definitely offers a lot of perspective into economic theory. Regardless of whether you are an economics concentrator or not, you should take this class!","Straightforward and interesting class, even if Mankiw only lectured about four times this semester.","If you want to learn about classical, highly simplified, economics, you should take this course.  Just keep in mind that terminology in this course is highly influenced by ideology.  If you do that, you'll learn a lot about one way of thinking about the world.","You can't let yourself get behind in this class or else you'll never catch up.  If you have a good TF and can really put a lot of time into the course, the information is interesting and the work is doable, but make sure you have the time to commit.","You'll get a good introduction to basic economic principles if you put in the time to read and learn it outside class.  However, you'll get this information thoroughly integrated with a justification of a particular worldview, which can be grating.","This is a good class to take if you are unsure about concentrating in economics or not.  Some kids realize they hate economics after this class and some end up really enjoying it.","It is often difficult to understand concepts without much review.","I think its very necessary to go to section. Do your problem sets and try to take every unit test.","It's Ec10. It's a slog. The midterms are a lot harder than the material you've been seeing. The psets demand a lot of time. Take the unit tests!","ec10 is a great class, and you cover a lot of material, but it is very important that you keep up on your reading. also, the amount of learning you will do in section is greatly dependent on your tf. there is a range of teaching skills among the tf's.","If you keep up with the readings for this course, the work and exams will not be too difficult.  The section component is hit or miss, but in general the material is worth taking the course for.","Make sure you keep up with the work and attend office hours.","If you've studied economics before, I highly recommend you consider reading the textbook for a week and then skipping to 1010, because the class will be a waste of time.","This class is definitely a lot of work but definitely worth it. The things I learned this year will help me understand politics, businesses and the economy much more than I would learn in any other class.","As an introductory economics class, it is essential to modern life.  However, Mankiw knows this and has made the course absolutely miserable because he knows people will take the course anyway.  He also likes indoctrinating people.","Important information to know, but not a very enjoyable class, at least if you're not that into economics. Requires you to be pretty engaged with the class and a good amount of work.","It's very informative if you've never seen economics before (which I haven't)","I really enjoyed the course material in the class. It was also quite the college experience taking a class that so many Harvard students take.","guest teaching and office hours good","Be prepared to compete with students who are already familiar with economics","The Problem sets are not to be scoffed at, and the course should be approached with seriousness if full value is to be gained from it.","the class is extremely important to understanding politics.","Everyone should take this course. Well-paced, fair workload, and extremely relatable and applicable to life.","Experience in this course depends mostly on your TF.","This class is entirely based on how good your tf is as a teacher, and how much time outside of class you are willing to put into office hours and extra work.","Go to office hours. The TF's are very helpful.","You get out of this class what you put in. The material is really interesting, but the class can become really difficult if you do not put in a certain amount of time and effort. I would recommend attending all of the lectures, participating in section, doing all of the textbook reading (on time!), and completing problem sets with a study group.","I really enjoyed Ec10, but a lot of that depended on having such a great TF. However, if you took any economics in high school, I would skip this course. The materials seems to all be covered in AP economics. If you're not interested in taking economics beyond this course, you should still definitely take ec10, it's basic information everyone should know.","This class gives you the tools you need to continue on in the field of economics and understand basic concepts of the economy. That being said, it is a really big class full of a lot of freshman, and if you don't go to section regularly, you really won't get much out of it. If you do go to section and office hours though, this will be a rewarding class.","It teaches you intuition that you wouldn't get from APs. Unless you think you understand how things work intuitively, I highly recommend this course before higher level of economics.","Spend a lot of time doing the problem sets, reading the book is not near as beneficial as digging through every problem and question","I think it's essential to take an introductory economics class, but be prepared for a lot of catch up if you have never taken economics.","You HAVE to make sure you like your TF at the beginning of the course. Your entire experience in Ec10 depends on it. Do Unit Tests.","Ec10 is very interesting and provides knowledge that everyone should have.","This is a good course to take regardless of whether you plan on concentrating in econ. It teaches valuable and applicable life skills and is generally interesting subject matter","Working with a group on psets is essential.","You gotta do it, it's not as easy as a lot of people say but the curves are nice.","As David Johnson will tell you, most economics useful for designing public policy can be learned at the ec10 level. \r\nAlso, David Johnson is by far the best part of this course. Go to his office hours. Just go. Trust me.","Only take this course if you want to go into economics. It is not a fun class and it is not worth all the work if you have no interest in the topic.","The best job Mankiw does the entire year of teaching economics is when he forces the 700+ person class to buy his $200 book on the first day.","The class is essentially a guided reading of the textbook. The course is not especially difficult, but the head TF tends to give hard questions that required extensive application of knowledge.","Go for office hours!","Contrary to popular belief, this class is not excessively conservative. Also, this class is great because it provides so many opportunities to do well, whether that be through unit tests, optional problems, or group problem sets.","Interesting class. Would suggest pass\/fail. P-sets are pretty tough and time- consuming.","I would tell them to not expect their TF to have the ability to teach well. If they get a TF who is not a very good teacher, they should no everything they possibly can to switch out because remaining with that TF puts them at an incredible disadvantage. I think David Johnson should teach the entire course.","This is a hard course and one that is rather unorganized. be prepared to study a lot alone","This course is not very exciting and not very fun. That being said, it is a prereq for a lot of economics courses you might want to take in the future and it is important to understand basic economics concepts in relation to other subjects.","It's worth taking if you want to learn about economics, but the TFs are seriously hit or miss, which is a big downside given that the course is taught in section.","Take this course to solidify your introductory economics knowledge!","I had taken IB HL Economics previously, while a significant portion of this class was review, I still felt like I learned a lot of new material as the basics are taught differently in Ec10 than they are in the IB. This course is more oriented with numbers rather than definitions and theory.","If you work and study hard and always go to section, you will succeed in understanding the material and do well in the course.","This class changes the way you view the news. I am and always will be a die-hard liberal, but ec10 allowed me to be able to understand the conservative standpoint, and therefore gave me better tools to engage in a political discussion.","Very interesting material, but can at times be dry.  Good foundation for further, more interesting economics study, however.","Definitely do the readings; they give you a good basis for understanding difficult concepts.","Understand that many of your peers would have taken economics prior to this course in high school. I think previous users' responses as to how inflated the curves are for exams are highly exaggerated.","Take this class. If you want to concentrate in Ec and you like it, great. If you decide you don't like it, you will still have learned some useful info.","Ec10 was my worst class at Harvard, but a large margin. All of my other classes have pushed me, excited me, and made me a better thinker. Ec10 only frustrated me, bored me, and make me determined to never again enroll in an econ course.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: some of the course is good (for instance, David Johnson is a gem), and the material (that David Johnson writes) is superb--challenging, interesting. The course is also run very smoothly (again, David Johnson--noticing a trend here?). Yet the majority of the course is painful... Depending on your TF, you'll have a terrible time because they won't teach you anything and you'll waste three hours every week in section. If you don't have solid math intuition, you'll find things difficult. I didn't know anyone who actually enjoyed this course. For me, this was a frustrating, self-taught course. I just used the book, helpful hints (put out by David Johnson), and p-sets to teach myself material. I never did as well as I thought I would have, and I was almost always irritated. AND, worst of all, I feel like I gave up a class in which I could have been empowered, expanded, challenged--like in ALL of my other Harvard classes (even, for example, language and statistics). \r\n\r\nBut, the reality is you'll probably have to take it if you're looking at a lot of different options. I took this course to fulfill a Social Studies requirement, originally thinking it'd be a great experience (naive, I know) and that I'd take the whole year (economics IS important). Yet, I've grown really sour over this course and want to cut my losses after first semester...maybe I'll look for an econ course elsewhere. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Ec10 was unenlightening and horrible, but David Johnson kicks ass.","The Unit Test system is your best friend, and the Helpful Hints are a huge help for p-sets and exams.","Take the unit tests and do not ever be discouraged if you do not pass. The unit tests helped immensely in terms of understanding the material. Take your time to understand and do the PSETs because those are the types of questions that will be given on the tests.","I would tell them that you learn a lot but that the tests are very hard and it may not be worth it if you have no further interest in economics. It's definitely a weed-out class.","I enjoyed learning about economics in this class. The fact that so many other freshmen took it was also a plus, as you could discuss topics and lectures with lots of people you ran into.\r\n\r\nSometimes this class seems elementary and intuitive, other times, you feel like you are arbitrarily memorizing.  The guest lectures were excellent for relating the topics to real-life transactions of every kind, but some of the topics you had to take on faith, trusting that they would come in handy in future studies of Economics.","Problem sets take forever and the teaching fellows can either be great or terrible, depends on your luck","The course is very section heavy. If your TF is not that great, you will be in for a rough time.","Do the problem sets by yourself.  They are the best way to learn the material.","Harder than it seems.","You definitely come out of this class understanding the fundamentals...but be prepared for difficult exams and challenging problem sets. If you're looking to fulfill a Social Studies requirement with this and aren't super keen on it, look for an alternative!","You are going to have to go the extra mile, on problem sets and exams. Get ready.","The class is an amazing introduction to microeconomics. I had a great section leader and it was a lot of work but well worth it.","It is more difficult than I expected.","What you get out of this course is a direct function of what you put into it. A person who has a strong interest in economics may find it more enjoyable than someone who does not. However, I think the information one learns in this course is important for everyone to know, regardless of if one plans on concentrating in Econ or not.","The course is more challenging that one would think. People often consider Economics to be one of the simpler concentrations, but do expect to have to spend at least 5 or 6 hours (even more) on each pset and the exams are challenging. But the information you learn during Ec10 is extremely valuable. The course is also pretty well structured and I did feel like I was getting the education I wanted despite the large nature of the class.","I don't know why this class gets such a bad rep. I found it genuinely interesting and I loved how it was so structured. My section at least was extremely useful and while the psets were hard they were manageable.","It's a must-take class. The information here is extremely important to know. It really depends on your TF to be able to make you engaged with the material, but I would recommend everyone to take it and become more knowledgeable.","From what I have heard from other students, your experience really depends your TF. I was lucky enough to have a very patient TF who taught the material clearly and effectively, so I enjoyed my EC 10 experience. The workload was very reasonable. The exams were tough. Overall, I would say it's a pretty relevant and meaningful course.","This course isn't particularly enjoyable, and Psets can be sort of a grind.  That said, it is well-structured and does give you a good foundation in economics, which can be useful in a wide variety of fields.  Take the unit tests, as they are easy and essentially free points.  Note that when people say \"it's taught in section,\" they mean it.  In a typical week, you might have section Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and no lecture.  Lectures in Sanders (sometimes by Prof. Mankiw and sometimes by other professors from the department) are maybe every 3 weeks on average.  In short, Ec 10 is hardly anybody's favorite course, but you probably will (and should) take it at some point.","Take advantage of the Unit Tests and office hours.","Use office hours-- they are a great chance to learn through application and help significantly with psets.","Everyone has a strong opinion about ec10 - but this class is worth it. You will be so much more knowledgeable about the world and how it works. The work is very manageable.","Everyone should have a solid foundation in economics to better understand the world and put it in context. This course is a great way to obtain that knowledge in economics, especially if you are looking into concentrating in this subject.","This class is really difficult. It is poorly taught and even if you have a wonderful TF, it still requires a lot of time, effort, and dedication on your part. Be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort. The reward might be worth it in the end for you. Some of the content is really practical stuff that everyone should know. The guest lectures are also PHENOMENAL. They really inspire you to change the world and continue learning economics.","Good intro class, but if you are really not thinking of being an EC major I wouldn't bother with it.. There are so many other great courses at Harvard and taking EC10 simply because its EC10 is silly","The class is good as long as you realize that it is only taught in section. You will learn nothing from Mankiw, so if you go in expecting that you will be disappointed.","Basic economic principles is something everyone should know to understand the world around them.","Only take it if you think you'll actually be interested in the material!  Don't take because everyone else is.","This is a hard class. I had never learned any economics before, and this class made me feel stupid and inadequate like no other classes at Harvard. Only take it if you absolutely have to. \r\n\r\nAlso, Mankiw opened the class by saying that if you want to make money in the future, you should take his class. As someone whose main career goal is definitely not to make a lot of money, I was incredibly offended. That said, there were some great guest lectures on inequality.\r\n\r\nAlso, the unit tests made me feel absolutely miserable. You get failed by a student your age, in front of 2-6 students from the class, when everyone knows only the bottom 15% get failed. It is truly humiliating, and to be honest, only exacerbates the mental health issues that we have at harvard by putting so much pressure on you to succeed and making it so hard for you to feel confident if you fail in front of everyone.","Do your psets early then make sure they're right during your TF's office hours. Pretty convenient method by which to receive economics credit.","Just stay on top of the readings and do the Psets on your own and you'll be fine...","It's great and interesting.","Read the textbook and find friends to do the problem sets with. This class will certainly get you thinking about the problems, and it may take you a long time to figure something out. But when you do, the feeling is quite rewarding.","The problem sets are annoying, but the course is good if you get good TFs.","Interesting course and also not that difficult; the 7PM midterms can be bothersome if you are an \"early to bed\" type person","Be ready to work, and don't skip section.","This is a great course, it would be a shame to go to Harvard and not attend take the world's best intro econ course!","This class is interesting, though the teaching may not be. Take this if you have any interest in economics, but if not, don't feel obligated. It's a solid course.","Economics 10 is the gateway to any meaningful study of econ at this school. It's a rather dull course but if you put in work and have some good luck with your section leader, you should do fine. Communication with students is not always the clearest so be sure to study with friends so you don't miss anything. If you have any interest in understanding how economics affects politics this class is a must.","Perhaps, you are doing this class because you want to venture through in some sort of finance. Fine, that is acceptable. The concepts and theories will help you gain an understanding of the economy as a whole, and may even generate further interest in that understanding. But the first semester is hard work. You do not see Prof. Mankiw as much as you think. Only once every month, I'd say. And you need to be involved in the course material at all time. That means, read and be on top of things. Take notes in and out of class. Prepare questions, and do not be afraid to speak up and set up meetings with your TF or go to another teaching fellow that help you more efficiently.","don't take it unless you need to for your concentration or secondary, very uninspiring and bland, not enough important material is covered in section","Don't take it unless you really like economics.","This class is very poorly designed, but the material is interesting and applicable to real life. The lecturers are seldom interesting, section is a summary of the textbook, there is almost no time for questions outside of office hours, and the course lessons don't really prepare you very well for the work that is expected of you. But the concepts are very interesting and very reasonable, and the class can be pretty enjoyable if you put in effort on your own.","The material is very interesting but it requires enough determination and interest to do well in the class.","Ec10 covers some really important material about how the world works, and for that reason, I think it is an important course for everyone to take. However, the course's stumbling blocks arise from the necessity to essentially mass produce the class for hundreds of students with few actual professors teaching and lots of TFs merely following marching orders. Section leaders basically reproduce the notes they are given up on the board. On the other hand, I did appreciate how the course, David Johnson specifically on the psets and exams, tries to encourage us as students to \"synthesize\" and think creatively. For the most part though, I felt that I was trapped into a funnel class--points taken off for extraneous, unnecessary details on exams and sections that did not encourage creativity but rather rote repetition and memorization of material.","You have to take it if you are interested in the economics concentration.","The course overall is not bad and David Johnson is fantastic but the TFs and Mankiw are not good teachers.","EC10 gets you started in thinking with the unique economics mind. The way the theory is taught is excellent and truly comprehensive, Helpful Hints are given which I TRULY recommend to understand the theory - the graphs, why the graphs happen that way, and what you need to know for tests. The essence of the class is not only its good teaching of theory, but also DAVID JOHNSON. He makes everything so clear, ties it up, through both the PSET answer sheets he puts out as well as his test review sessions. His synthesis of everything we learn just makes you feel accomplished in what you have learned, and too connect to real life economic and political issues. EC10 gets you started in the economics career path in the perfect way, with excellent staff, great lectures (who I think should take an even larger role), and outstanding sources of information. I enthusiastically recommnend it. (I found reading Mankiw not necessary to do well - buy the study guide version of it).","If you want to be an Economics concentrator or want to learn about Economics, this is a good introductory course. It's cool that you get to hear lectures by the author of your textbook and other distinguished professors and economists. Section basically goes through the basics of the textbook chapters, which is helpful because you create a solid foundation. Problem sets are a bit tricky because they ask you to apply the basic concepts in different ways, but they are manageable. Exams are fairly difficult, because again, they take the basics and elevate them to a higher level. The course is fast-paced, so it is important to keep up on readings not only in the textbook, but the required readings for each unit so you're not scrambling days before each exam. Overall, Ec 10 is a basic economics course that is good for an introduction to the subject.","Your enjoyment of this class is heavily contingent upon the quality of your TF. If you do not seem to be clicking with your TF's style, I recommend switching, because the TFs are critically important in this process. It is a VERY interesting course to take, and it is challenging (but not to the point of impossibility) if you haven't taken a real econ course before.","If you have already taken Economics classes in high school and have a good grasp on it (for example if you took Economics A Level), do not take this class. Almost all the things you learn in this class will be repetitive and you will get very little out of it.","This course is very well run, but can be challenging. Economics demands a different mode of thinking, but applies directly to the modern world and our future responsibilities. I recommend this course if you are at all interested in Economics.","depends heavily on section. If your section leader is good (which happens very rarely!), the class might be good, but if your section is bad, then this course will be a bad experience.","It's a good class. Take advantage of the unit tests!","Material is awesome and super useful; it's great for emphasizing how important reason and assumptions are in real life.\r\n\r\nBesides that, this class sucks.  Lots of points off for little things, poorly worded assignments, very little useful feedback on assignments, bad lectures (Calvinism? Seriously?), and a pretty heavy conservative bias: all of these things were pretty annoying.  I took this class P\/F so I wouldn't have to worry about all this stuff, but a lot of people don't have this luxury and had to deal with these things, which was not a fun experience.","It is important information to know, but the class is poorly structured due to its size and as a result it becomes very difficult.","Great class, but it takes a lot of time.","Do the problem sets alone and without help.","Only reason to recommend it is if you have to take it for credit.","Dont fall behind in this course. Stay on top of your work and attendance in class.","I learned a lot. This class made me switch my concentration to Economics.","hard but needed","If you go to Harvard and don't take Ec 10, what are you doing?","If you have taken AP Econ in high school and did well, it should be pretty easy for you.  It is doable if you haven't but it is going to take a substantial amount of more work.  As for the way it is taught -- it is kind of like everyone says.  It really isn't that great, but you learn to make use of the resources that are given to you (office hours etc).","If you do decide to take this class, be prepared to do quite a lot of work yourself in terms of reading through the book and helpful hints and attending different office hours to answer your questions.","It's a generally good class to take - I think you learn things that just help you understand the world better- newspapers make a bit more sense, politics makes a bit more sense, etc.","This is a very useful class that everyone should take, regardless of intended concentration.  That said, realize that this is a large intro course that is largely dependent on TF and is taught almost entirely in section.  Overall, take advantage of office hours, especially those of the head TF.","If you read the textbook, go to section and take unit tests, you need to do little studying to do well, just because the information is just reinforced from so many people and with so many explanations (with theory, on a graph\/mathematically, common sense). They do a good job of introducing you to different applications of economics as well, especially if you're thinking economics is just for people who want to work on wall street."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Have people to work\/study with","The course covers interesting material. However, section is not very helpful so you'll pretty much have to learn everything on your own if you want to do well.","for me, the second semester was much more enjoyable. when you get into chapters 30-35, you can really see how what you are learning applies to the actual economy. the outside readings show that people like ben bernanke are using the same basic tools as you are learning","Ec 10 is a solid course for anyone that wants an in-depth introduction to economics. The section component of the class is not ideal though.","Only take this course if you're interested in concentrating in Econ. Most of the people I talked to agreed that macro was harder than micro, so consider your options VERY carefully when deciding whether to continue after the first semester.","Good class if you can get a good TF.

They really help you understand the material in class!","Ec 10 is a quintessential Harvard experience. Although the experience depends largely on who your TF is, since nearly all of the material is taught in section, the material is useful and relevant -- especially since we broaden our perspective in the spring semester to study how the US and world economies as a whole work. It can get confusing, though, since there are so many more variables and nuances to macro. A few tips:\r\n1. Read the TEXTBOOK, it helps a lot! It's also well-written\/easy to read. Plus if you have a bad TF you can always rely on the textbook.\r\n2. Read the HELPFUL HINTS posted on the course website they are so helpful (hence the word helpful)\r\n3. Take the UNIT TESTS (they're a great grade-booster and do a good job of summing up what we've learned).\r\n4. Skim the textbook chapter summaries before the unit tests.\r\n5. Go to David Johnson's REVIEW SESSIONS before exams...they're magical.\r\n6. Form study groups\/friends taking the class to work on PSETS together. (Don't split up the PSET and each do separate sections; instead do the whole thing yourself and check with friends\/discuss concepts you might not understand while doing them.)","You should definitely take it just to become a better consumer in the everyday world.","Overall the course is very, very fair. What you put in is what you get out. The curve is a life-saver.","A solid introduction to economics, but for someone like me--better suited for reading and writing rather than economics--it was tough and required a lot of work.","This class essential for who wants to pursue a degree in Economics, and for those who want to have a good perspective on how the real world functions. However, this is not an exciting class.","This is a good class to take and you will know very quickly if economics is for you or not. Either way, the information learned will be very useful for you in life.","Macro is much more enjoyable than micro and makes more sense.  Although the topic is confusing and the growth and synthesis models may make your head spin.  Don't get behind and take your unit tests!","Definitely a great way to be introduced and achieve a baseline understanding of economics","While this class does cover a wide variety of material, it doesn't have much depth in any subject.

The material is fascinating.","Ec 10 probably isn't anybody's favorite Harvard class, but I definitely liked it better than I anticipated. \r\nIt can be a grind at times, but it is certainly doable if you keep up with the work, and it gets a lot more interesting once you get to the macro half of the course.  The course is well-organized and structured, midterms and finals are fair, and the combination of Psets and review materials is very good preparation for the midterms and finals.  They really don't play \"hide the ball\" in this class.  Try not to save the Psets for Thursday night.  Also, as long as your TF is ok with it, typing the non-graph portions of Psets can be helpful.","The class can be hard for some and easy for others. But, the material is very helpful to know.

I was fortunate enough to have an excellent TF (and yes, there are good TFs besides David Johnson) so I enjoyed the class a lot.\r\n\r\nI'd say this: make time for office hours (I tended to need them more this semester than I did in the fall, as the psets involved more critical reading and interpretation of real data) and read the textbook (it's very helpful and some of the material isn't covered in section).","You should definitely take the class. Tests are hard, but you learn so much about the way that markets work, and this type of knowledge is essential for any job you wish to have after college!","Not the greatest of courses - taking it as a junior was a bit odd. You can get through the problem sets\/unit tests without knowing the material, but you will need to learn it for the exams, which is best done by doing the problem sets\/unit tests well.","You should take this course if you are fairly sure that you are concentrating in economics, and it will give you a very good baseline understanding of what to expect in future courses.","Keep up with the readings and do as much of the problems sets on your own as you can.  Utilize office hours and review sessions.  David Johnson and Greg Mankiw are great sources.","I recommend that you take this class in order to get an introduction to economics, but keep in mind that the class is a pedagogical nightmare. I recommend it only because there is no alternative in Harvard College. Be prepared to teach the material to yourself and do not expect much teaching support or engagement from Prof. Mankiw.","A way to fulfill US & World where you might actually learn something!","The class is very easy if you already know some macro, so it may not be helpful to take. But if you haven't taken a macro class yet, it's very helpful.","Whether or not you've taken an economics course in the past, Ec10 does a pretty competent job of teaching you the foundations of macro and microeconomic theory, which is useful information to know regardless of what you want to concentrate in. However, it's important for you to know that most of the class is taught in section (you rarely see Mankiw...he lectures maybe six times the entire year), so a large part of what you take away from the class depends on who your TF is and whether or not you make good use of office hours. Definitely attend Head TF, David Johnson's office hours and review sessions when you can. He is a very engaging speaker, and a great help when you're stuck! The exams are difficult, but the general score curves are pretty generous, so it's not a huge issue.","Stay on top of things","Can be a hard class, but if you put in the time to study and do the work you can do well and learn a lot and it is a very rewarding, relative class.","Ec 10 gives an excellent overview of economics, and teaches you \"how the world works\" on an elementary level. While not necessarily the most exciting or action-packed course, it is a good, worthwhile way to gain a better understanding of our economy.  Problem sets take time, but office hours are extremely helpful.","Learning the basics of economics is an important skill and it is worth taking this course because the analytical skills are useful, but it is not a particularly engaging or well-taught class.","- A solid introduction to among the most important subjects to understand in order to be an informed citizen. Solid structure. Not too hard.\r\n- Make sure to maneuver to get a good tf at the beginning.\r\n- Go to David Johnson's office hours. He is a gifted teacher, even if he's over exuberant and sometimes a bit intimidating.","Get as much exposure to David Johnson as you can; he has been teaching this so long he knows the material like the back of his hand and has unbelievable enthusiasm for it. Going to office hours even once every 2 weeks will be well worth it.","It's wise to keep up with readings.","I do not think Ec10 is a good course. The instruction in section is weak, there is a huge disconnect between what is taught and what is tested, and it makes economics uninteresting.","Its ec10. you have to take this or jump to ec1010\/11. if you dont know ec, take it. if you took ec in high school, jump ahead","There are so many students that the class is kind of hard so they make a real curve. Section really depends on your preceptor - try to switch if you can get a better teacher. Lectures are interesting.","Ec 10 is what you would expect. The material is quite interesting, but the teaching relies on prepackaged material--Mankiw's book and Johnson's problem sets--rather than good teachers.","I would not recommend taking this course unless you intend on concentrating in economics and already have a background in economics. If you think, as I did, that it would be interesting and good to learn, think again. The class is very hard if you have never taken economics and they ask a lot of you on problem sets and exams without giving you much preparation.","take to broaden horizons, understand NPR, learn to schmooze at Harvard Cocktail Parties","Not very good","hard but with it","Find a good TF! It is really the make-or-break-it part of the class. If you have a good TF, put effort into the psets and go to office hours (both your TF's and David Johnson's), it's an incredible learning experience. If you don't it's pretty awful. If you get a bad TF, you're allowed to switch TFs within your grading group.","an interesting course that emphasizes a synthesis of concepts","Much of this class depends on your section leader, so be sure to get a good one. Not my favorite class in terms of teaching style, but useful for real life.","I would say \"unlikely to recommend\" but seeing as this class is a requirement for many concentrations or classes you probably should take this class. Economics is also a useful subject to be familiar with, but this class is not very organized and be prepared to do most if not all of the learning on your own.","Great course for the introduction of economics.  Works for concentrators and non-concentrators alike.","While lectures may seem bland and boring at first (that doesn't really change), stick with this class if you want something that actually teaches you how the world works.","This course is a very standard intro course - large and impersonal. The sections make it better in terms of having more individualized attention, but even for sections, there was little interaction and discussion.","It's just one of those classes you have to take if you want to concentrate in Econ.  I recommend you go to sections and office hours as much as you can.  Psets aren't too bad but the midterms and finals can be much more difficult than the material you learn in class.  Do the unit tests and work hard and you should be fine.  The material and course is not interesting, but you have to get through the class to concentrate in economics.","Good, solid class.  Basically you get out what you put in.  Teach yourself the material and you'll be fine.  If you do the reading and the PSets and go to section, you should ace this class.","It is a fun and important class to take in your Harvard years.","Ec 10-you should probably take it. Some of the criticism is valid, but what the class teaches you is integral.","Ec 10 is a large intro class that probably does a very good job of teaching foundational economics skills. However, I thought it was very poorly taught and run. The p-sets were extremely hard and require one to do a lot of extra work trying to decipher what the questions are asking. They didn't seem to match what we learned in section - they were harder and different. It is also necessary to go to your TFs office hours if you want any hope of getting started on the right path.","Ec 10 gives you the knowledge and tools to understand and formulate opinions about many of the topics commonly debated. I entered this course close minded and ignorant to the science of economics; however, I have left economics with a firm  understanding and respect for opinions different than mind.","Mankiw doesn't do any real teaching, you only go to his lectures to hopefully take notes on something that may be in an exam, not to learn. The real learning happens in section.","Moves quite slowly and is taught almost exclusively in section, but very good if you want a not too challenging course that gives a good intro into economics.","This course gave me a great foundation for understanding current events and the lectures made me more aware of different aspects of economics.","EC 10 is NOT as bad as many people claim. Yes, a lot depends on your TF, but even more depends on you. If you get unlucky with your TF, don't use that as an excuse not to study. You can do it. Is it a really easy class? No. A really hard one? No. It is a very good intro to economics though and I feel like I learned a lot.","It's probably necessary that you take this class; but if it's not, don't do it.","I would tell future students exactly what was told to me: You need to take Ec10 and you will learn a lot, but it isn't a particularly involved class and you won't learn from Mankiw.","lectures aren't always worth going to","You learn a lot about economics and it's pretty useful.","Ec 10 is a solid introductory economics course, but you will have to make an effort in order to get personal attention in the class. Go to unit tests, since they are helpful. Also try to get into david Johnson's section: He is a fantastic teacher, although probably a stricter than average problem set grader.","Take this course to become an informed citizen\/voter.  Don't expect much from Mankiw.  David Johnson is where it's at.","its a commitment, but worth it if you want to learn economics.","It's a difficult class that you need to spend a lot of time practicing and reading in order to know the material well.","This is the king of all large intro courses, but it's the sort of course that every Harvard student ought to take. The sense of community you get from being in a class with so many of your peers is awesome (it feels like you're taking on a giant). On top of this, it gave me a new perspective on everything I read in the news and generated a love of Economics in me.","Ec10b is a great introduction to macroeconomic theory. It also did a good job of teaching U.S. macroeconomic policy history. The problem with Ec10b (and Ec10 in general) is the variability in the quality of the TFs. But if you get a good one (as I had), Ec10b is a worthwhile experience.","I definitely learned a lot about economics because of this course, but I did almost all of that learning on my own by using the textbook and helpful hints.  For some reason lecture and section were not very effective learning tools for me.  Unit tests are relentless, but I guess they kind of help to keep you on top of the material.","Life knowledge. Everyone should have to take this class.","Not as easy as everyone makes it sound.","Requires a lot of self-learning if you have a bad TF","It teaches you a lot, but you have put in effort to learn more than the textbook offers.","This is a very popular course at Harvard. I took it because of this and because I have never taken an economics course before and was considering an economics\/business concentration. The knowledge is practical, but I did not find it very interesting, personally.","The course material is interesting but the course itself is drawn out and rather laborious. The tests are disproportionately difficult, and even so the curve allows pretty much everyone to escape with at worst a B or B+.","This is great intro to economics and helps you look at the world in a more fiscally enlightened manner.","I highly recommend Economics 10 because it is one of the most useful courses here at Harvard. The information you learn in this course is one that is very helpful in understanding what is happening to the economy. If you want to learn about bonds, how the Federal Reserve works, how monetary and fiscal policy affect the quantity of goods produced in the market, unemployment and inflation, the market for loanable funds and how net capital outflow relates to the trade account, then take macroeconomics!","You will learn valuable things for the future, though you won't necessarily enjoy it all the way along. The material deals with a frustration combination of common sense and less obvious reasoning. It is challenging to stay present at the lectures, whether physically or mentally, but it helps to sit near the front -- definitely doesn't help to sit in the balcony with friends, if you're trying to pay attention. Make use of David Johnson's office hours if you want to get excited about the material, or your own TF's if you want to get a handle on how to deal with questions on the problem set in a relatively straight forward way. If your TF is awful or not great--which definitely happens--make use of the office hours of other TFs.","For all the bad thing you'll hear about this class, it's really not that bad. Though a lot of the class depends on your TF, there are a lot of great TFs out there, and the subject material is really hammered down so you know what's going on.","Just take it. You might not enjoy it all the time, but you should take it anyway.","This is a great introductory course and I found that the principles I learned were applicable to everyday life. However, your experience in the course does largely depend on your section TF.","EC 10 is a right of passage. it's not fun but you need to take this to get through the rest of your life without looking like and idiot.","GET A GOOD SECTION LEADER, collaborate on psets and study hard for exams! Take advantage of OH's as well.","I had never taken an economics course before Ec 10. It's not the most well-organized course, but it tries to accommodate for unlucky students (those who happen to get a bad section leader) with 'helpful hints' and unit tests. Those certainly help, but don't make up for a weak TF and a weak textbook. I ended up learning some concepts really well and others poorly, so I think the course is just so big that it's messy. It's okay, only take if you need the most basic intro to Ec.","If you have any interest in Economics, you don't really have a choice but to take this course. I might caution you to wait until after your freshman year to take it to (1) see if you actually have an interest in Econ, and (2) get a sense of how you'll manage its rather regular workload.","If you are an adult going into the world and you know nothing about economics you are in trouble. This is a good course to teach you about what you need to know about economics","This course is invaluable. It offers a great way to think and provides you with the necessary framework to understand economic goings-on in the news. Everyone at Harvard should take this course, if not the fall portion then at least the macro component.","It definitely requires a fair amount of work and you need to stay on top of the material, but there are a lot of pieces in place to help you with that (i.e. problem sets, unit tests, section, etc) and, overall, the course is a great introduction to economics.","I really don't think there's any point in recommending or not recommending this class since I think most of the people who take it do so because they have to for their concentration or something else. The class is the kind of class people think of when they think of Harvard (which is a shame, because most classes here aren't like this): a disinterested professor who lectures about four times a semester and doesn't seem to want much to do with students, plus a bunch of grad students who may or may not actually know what they're doing in front of a classroom. That said, the class taught me economics, which is pretty much all I can ask of it.","It's a 750 person course, so it is what it is.  The textbook isn't too bad, but it won't help for any of the assessments.  The problem sets are very challenging.  There are WIDE, WIDE disparities between sections based on your TF.  Some simply spend section writing the textbook vocab definitions and graphs on the board, read them out loud, and let you copy them down.  Others synthesize the information and ask questions that lead toward understanding.  Some TFs grade Psets on a check system, others on a point system, some drop certain psets, others don't.  The differences are unacceptable -- we don't get to choose our TFs.  That being said, I don't think I regret taking it.  I wanted some understanding of the country's economy before graduating, which I did gain.","Go to David Johnson's review sessions, they are very helpful!","The course is awesome, interesting, and useful. If you have doubts about taking it, don't! All the material is very comprehensible and shows how large economies function and influence each other. It is interesting and the workload is very reasonable. The course does not attempt to cram an unrealistic amount of material into a semester. You will come out having learned, not memorized, economics.","Go to office hours. Do all the problem sets. Hope that you have a helpful and nice TF. Go to all the unit tests. Put in all the effort needed and you'll do well - put in an average effort and you'll do average. Up to you.","Be ready for long Thursday nights staying up late to finish the weekly problem sets. The tests are very manageable and not too difficult.","I found Macroeconomics to be highly more engaging and intersting than Microeconomics. You will find that if you have taken AP Macroeconomics (like I did) then this will be a much easier stroll in the park than Micro. There are cool things to synthesize in this class and everything you learn can be applied to the way the economy is currently shifting in the world. Word of advice: Go to David Johnson's office hours! They will literally help you open your eyes to the meaning of why we learn econ.","It's not a sensational course, but the course material and the way it's taught is contemporarily relevant and, in my opinion, very important to know.","Economics is such a fantastic study of everyday life. Macro especially really elucidates economic news and policy discussions. The course is pretty easy, so don't worry about taking it with other classes. I knew nothing at all about econ coming in, and now I'm going for a secondary in it. The lectures are alright, but the book and section (which is how the course is taught) are awesome, especially if you're with Trisha.","Psets are tough, but definitely work in a group. The course work in useful even if you are not planning to concentrate in Economics.","Take this class! They do a great job of teaching you logic and the fundamentals of economics!","Obviously, I can't not recommend this course because it is a requirement for so many things. However, I do feel that your experience with EC10 is entirely dependent on your TF. It can make the class extremely frustrating, especially in my case where my TF didn't cover things. But overall, EC10 is a staple course here at Harvard, and despite the poor teaching, it all ends up being okay.","Make sure you have a good TF and you attend office hours and read helpful hints and keep up with textbook readings!","This is a very standard intro class at Harvard. Despite its flaws, I think everyone should take this course to see how Harvard classes work. It's a good transition class into college classes. It teaches you the basics of Econ, but as you can see in some of the other classes, there are problems when the class is huge.","Don't take Ec 10. This is common knowledge toucan gain by reading the book. This class ha useful material to teach, but is taught unfairly. You will not get the same information as your peers. Even though the content is worth it, the structure of the class is horrible.","Only take if you have to.","Its alright.","While the course itself lacks a bit of organization and the TFs are not all equally qualified at teaching, in general this is a very useful class. The content itself is very relevant and David Johnson does a great job, especially with the psets, making the material applicable to real world situations. Economics is a subject that is constantly a matter of international news so having even a basic knowledge of the topic is, I think, pretty important. Ec 10 is a great way to obtain that knowledge.","A good class to take no matter what your intended concentration. The lectures are the best part of the class.","this class is definitely the most useful class I've taken at Harvard so far,\r\nbut you have to be willing to put in the effort b\/c it is extremely challenging and a lot of work.\r\nI would take it P\/F if not a concentration requirement.","EC challenges you and makes you think about how the world works.  The structure of the class is kind of lousy, but make sure you get help outside of class if you are confused.","If you read the book you wont get less than a B. Awesome curve on tests.","Try as hard as you can to get a good TF because your grade will greatly depend on this! Also, some people worry about whether or not you can take the macro part of the course without the micro, and you can do just that.  The only thing is that the course heads seem to ignore the fact that there are students joining who didn't take the course first semester and so it is assumed that you already know the procedure for problem sets and unit tests.","This class is definitely good for \"life\"-it has helped me understand the world around me much better, especially in terms of current events. However, it's definitely not a class that you will enjoy.","great comprehensive course","You can't graduate from Harvard without taking this, or at least you shouldn't. It's almost a sin to miss out on this amazing opportunity to be taught by some of the best economists in the world. You'll also be surprised at how much you learn: basically you can sit on the board of the federal reserve and no one would know that you only took intro econ (well, unless you push it).","Take this to learn this, not fulfil a requirement.","Ec10 is a good course. I don't know about the organization of the course, but the material is interesting and useful. If you want to study economics you will have to take it anyway. But if you're not an ec person, I would still recommend taking it because it teaches some basic things about our economy.","This course should be meant just for economics concentrators.","it's challenging but useful for the real world.","I never thought I would be interested in economics, but after taking this course, I will likely concentrate in it. Highly recommended.","Although this is a basic, intro economics course, there is quite a lot of work and preparation for exams. Problem sets are fairly difficult, so be sure to ask your TF if you have any questions. The exams are hard, but there is usually a generous curve. It teaches important concepts of the economy that everyone should know, so even if you aren't planning on concentrating in economics, you should consider taking this course.","Some people find it boring at times, but the material is essential if your interested in anything from economics\/business to politics. And yes, David Johnson is the best teacher I've had here so far.","Be prepared for an impersonal feeling, a potentially not so great TF, and a few boring lectures. But if you work hard you can get a lot out of the class, and they will do a good job of getting you versed in the fundamentals of Economics.","I enjoyed the material and absolutely loved my TF. I hear the TF makes a huge difference, but I got lucky and consequently loved the class. The lectures were interesting, though, and didn't mind the textbook.","This class is difficult but a teaches a way of thinking that is very helpful in being successful.","I enjoyed micro but didn't enjoy macro. Macro felt unfocused and wasn't taught as well as micro (not in terms of the TF, just in terms of the curriculum and the class' approach to the material). It's a good freshman class to take, though.","It's the best way to get a general economics view at Harvard, but it's hard to be invested in the class with so many TFs and there is little support if you need help.","Be prepared for difficult problem sets and tests that do not correlate with what you have been doing in class. The textbook is pretty straightforward but section and assignments complicate the things in the book.","It's a good class.  I learned a lot over the past semester, but the tests can be annoying because they have so much multiple choice.  Go to your TF office hours for help on the problem sets.  Don't expect it to be a seminar, it's a huge class.","How well you learn in this course is likely defined by how good your TF is.  Study for tests by reviewing basic concepts and practice, practice, practice.","Ec 10 is a lot like Annenberg food. It's usually serviceable, never spectacular, but is a Harvard staple. Its convenience usually outweighs its mediocrity.","The course is boring but useful.  It is definitely a standard introductory economics course.","it's ok","Economic arguments are extremely useful in other classes.","A very important class that I'm glad I took, but one that will be what you make of it. Actually trying hard on p-sets and doing unit tests makes a big difference.","Macro is much more enjoyable than Micro. The speakers are incredible, and it feels truly relevant and in some ways transcendent. Learning about the financial crisis from Larry Summers in Ec10 in Sanders Theater? Sort of crazy. But as always, although the negatives about Ec10 come along with it. Very tolerable, sometimes enjoyable, other times torturous.","If you're concentration is Econ, then you have to take it. If not, then still take it because it is very applicable to understanding very applicable concepts. The psets are a pain though, you will spend many hours at your TF's office hours trying to finish them.","You have to be prepared to do a lot of work on your own and drawing from many resources, like the lectures, problem sets, section, and office hours, to prepare for the exams.","Be careful.  It is such a popular class and I felt pressured to take it, but I would really think twice and reconsider.","Though this is not a top-tier difficulty class, it is easy to get complacent and not study properly for the exams, they are challenging especially for someone who has no economics experience.","Get a good TF.","Ec10 is your basic intro class.  One added bonus is that it is taught by some of the most accomplished economists in the country.","give a good first economics understanding","It's useful to know some stuff about economics, even if this isn't the most thrilling class you'll ever take.","Stick it out through micro and macro is a lot better and relevant.","This class should only be taken if you need it to go on to further econ courses or if you think econ is necessary in your life, otherwise it is not very enjoyable.","This is a significant class in any undergraduate's career. I study chemistry and found this course incredibly relevant to my life, and fun.","Very dependent on TF. Iwan was awesome!","I would only recommend ec10 if you are thinking about concentrating in ec, in which case it's a requirement. If you're taking the class in the hopes of learning the basics about the economy, like I did, you really only get that from a very small portion of macro and I would therefore not recommend it.","Although I wouldn't recommend this course I would suggest not to get caught up in the hype of hating it. Just do the readings and actually spend the time on it and it will be fine. The exams aren't that difficult. Again, as long as you spend the time you can do reasonably well.","I think this class is a great introduction to economics but you need to be willing to put in the extra effort in seeking help outside class, particularly if your section leader isn't as qualified as some of the other TFs may be.","More likely than not, if you're reading this, you have to take this course because it is required for your concentration or secondary, so my recommendation of whether or not to take the class is moot. However, I will say that this course is a solid, albeit dry, introduction to many economic concepts you will likely learn more about in future economics classes. The highlight of this class is definitely the guest lecturers. There are some very interesting, incredible people who come to speak to Ec 10. I found section rather unnecessary because I would read the chapters in the book that we would be going over and then the would just have the book regurgitated back at me in section.","Do NOT take this class unless you plan on concentrating in economics or it is required for something.","I am one of the few who really enjoyed this class.  it does a great job of promoting intuitive understanding, not mere memorization.\r\nThe Psets are tough but worthwhile.  Go to OH for help on them and theyre not bad \r\nAlso, read the TB chapters before section.  It makes the class so much easier","I really enjoyed Ec10. I was fortunate enough to have a very good TF and it had a huge impact on my Ec10 experience.","It's an intro class, so it's not going to be super exciting.","Ec 10, though not the most exciting course, does open doors to other, more advanced, more exciting courses and provides a basic understanding of economics.","I think the first semester was much more informative.  I think macro is simply too complicated to be presented in such a simplified fashion.  While the simplifications in micro can be tolerated, they simply confuse the macro concepts.  I wouldn't recommend the 2nd semester.","This is very good knowledge to have.","Solid Class. Solid TF. Solid Professor.","This course is the basics of economics, hard at times but necessary to understand further.","Make sure to work on and understand completely the weekly psets yourselves.","Even if you have no interest in pursuing economics beyond this intro class, you will benefit from Ec10.  The material will help you understand the way society functions, and it will give you insight into your own personal financing.  The course will be what you make of it.  You will get the most out of it if you read the textbook, participate in section, attend lecture, find a study group for problem sets and exams, and go to the unit tests!","Look, it's Ec10. If you don't have a basis for economics by the time you've graduated college, you've seriously missed a vital part of liberal arts education. The course, all things considered, is a pretty good one, and a great freshmen bonding experience.","Go to David Johnson's Office Hours-- they will help you","DO NOT take this class unless you absolutely have to in order to fulfill concentration\/secondary requirements or if you have an avid interest in economics. If you are just looking to get a foundation of knowledge of economics, don't take this class. The costs far outweigh the benefits. The TFs are awful, the textbook is dry, and the only redeeming aspect of this course is the excellent guest lecturers. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.","Ec10 is a solid, though basic, introduction to economics.  It is well-organized and gives a good overall sense of the subject at Harvard.  It wimps out on math, which is good for those who are not math inclined but not so good for others. Overall, this course is better than most give it credit for.","I took this as a sophomore elective and am SO glad I did! If you are interested in economics at all, just take Ec 10. It is REALLY not that hard--do the readings, do the pset (with friends!), and go to your TF's office hours if you have questions. Aside from section, that's 6 hours a week. It is absolutely manageable. The exams get tricky sometimes, but the curves are great. Also, don't take this just because you want to go into finance!","If you're interested in learning how government policies affect your life go for this class.","Understanding the principles of economics is essential to being an effective citizen no matter what you do with your life.","It sucks","An interesting class, much, much, much better than the fall microeconomics semester. The only reservation I have is how necessary it is to take this class before 1010 or 1011. I know people who went straight into those classes and were fine. However, macroeconomics is a fascinating subject. Every person should understand how the economy works.","It's a good class, but it's really not all that necessary. I feel like it's not that fundamental or necessary of a course, even though it might seem to be.","It's more challenging of a course than it seems at first. Go to office hours for problem sets, make sure you take the unit tests, and read the helpful hints!","Ec-10 is one of those classes you just have to take. If you're interested in the concentration, you actually have to take it. But even if you are not, this class teaches you logical thinking that you can apply to any concentration, and, like I said, it is just one of those experiences you have to have at Harvard.","Ec 10 is one of those classes that it seems like you need to take. However, if you think you have sufficient background to skip straight to intermediate level (Ec1010 or Ec1011) I would recommend that route. Ec10 is not very well organized, the problem sets are not indicative of anything taught in section, and the exams aren't really based on the problem sets. The course seems to rely heavily on previous economic knowledge or else slogging through unnecessarily 20 page long \"extra readings\" in addition to the entirety of Mankiw's textbook. If, like me, you have never taken econ before, this may unfortunately be your only option. The lectures are the best part, and you can attend those without being in the course.","The class itself isn't all that interesting. That being said, it is pretty easy, the curve is great, and it is knowledge you absolutely need if you are planning to take another Ec class here.","Prepare to study and be subject to an interesting curve.","Economics is essential to modern life, but this class is awful.  Sections are boring, Mankiw is annoying, arrogant, and biased, and the textbook is more of the same.  The class isn't too hard though and you can commiserate with all of your friends, who will also be taking the class with you.  The guest lecturers are a bright spot though.","Be prepared to work. A good grade isn't hard to get but a great great is hard.","Go to office hours, especially David Johnson's. Read the helpful hints!","This is, no doubt, the most important class offered here at Harvard. The information here is GENERAL and is IMPORTANT for EVERYONE to know about every day life.","This class is a great class in enhancing one's knowledge about both micro and macroeconomic theory.  It is rather difficult but the challenge is both refreshing and worth accepting.","It is a difficult class, but helpful in the real world.","Take this class if you want a general understanding of economics in the world, but be prepared to put time into it.","take it but work hard, not as basic as you may expect","you can do well in this class as long as you do the psets","The problem sets and the books teach you the basics of economics, however the test lean toward David Johnson's beliefs.","This course is a wonderful introduction to economics, but make sure to go beyond the book. Learn not just from the material given to you but also the problem sets. The problems often take you in a new direction from what the book covers.","If you're particularly good at math just take Econ 1010 (or 1011)... the course moves fairly slowly.","good class, most people should take it","If you've never studied economics before you will get a lot out of this course.  This was my first course in econ and I'm very pleased that I had the opportunity to explore this subject at Harvard.  It has definitely expanded my way of thinking about the world.","Take it!","It's no easy class, but I came out with a much better understanding of the world around me.","It's good to know economics.","I think it's a good class for everyone to take just to be more informed about the world","If you don't think you would major in Ec and have another class that looks more interesting to you, I would take that before Ec10. That said it is not a BAD class, but definitely not one of the best at Harvard. If you're someone who thinks you should take an Ec course just for the sake of it, just reading the Mankiw book might be enough to get exposed to the concepts.","This class is just one of those intro classes that you hate but have to do for your concentration.","Good if you want to concentrate in economics.","Its a tough course, but you will learn to think like an economist","Study groups, must read book, ask plenty of questions","Keep up with the readings!","I would tell everyone to keep in mind that this class is very math-based, and it is not the average econ class. It is much harder than that!!","Ec10 is a great class if you want to concentrate in economics, or even if you just want to learn about the subject!","It's a great primer for  economics department.","Don't bother reading the required readings, only read the conclusions and introductions. It takes way too long","Only take it if you're considering economics are a concentration. If not, a whole year of Ec becomes brutal after a while if you do not necessarily have an interest in finance. It may be relatively useful to know, but the course just becomes a burden after a while.","This does the job of being an introductory economics.","You get to learn a lot about macroeconomics, which is what is going on in our economy today. It's useful and interesting if you've ever wondered about the meaning of interest rates, the money supply, lower taxes, etc.","No student should graduate without taking this course.","Interesting material but there are brutal tests and annoying p sets","Take it. Even if you're not concentrating in Ec, it's useful to know this material.","This course definitely weeds out those who don't truly love economics. For the most part it is uninteresting and tedious.","It is a lot of work but if you enjoy the subject it is not too much of a struggle to get through everything","Well, you'll probably shop EC10 at least once. The experience depends on your TF so if you have a bad one switch out as fast as possible.","The course and material itself is wonderful, but the way it is graded is not.","it sucks, but you should take it","Ec 10 may be a bit challenging for those who have never taken an economics course in the past; however, it does provide you with very useful knowledge about the economy and how it works.","The overall course is great, but it also varies a lot from section to section.","Though the first semester of EC 10 is not the most excitng, macroeconomics gets a lot more interesting, especially if you are interested in how economic policy affects people's lives. Though it doesn't seem like it at times, all of the course material covered is related and can really help illuminate the basics of macroeconomics.","Ec10 is... Ec10. It's a large class, so be sure to get a good section leader; you'll probably hear a lot about David Johnson, but there's plenty of TF's that are nice graders but also teach the material well.","take econ in high school","This course is manageable, but organization is key. Schedule time to do the readings and start problem sets early, and stick to it mercilessly. Go to EVERY lecture - some of them are real gems - and take all the unit tests. This is the only way to both do well and actually gain something very valuable from this course. Great overview for any academic background or pursuit.","Start p-sets early","Very good course in that you will develop a solid understanding of some basic concepts that will help you become a more informed voter and citizen","Your T.F. makes or breaks the class. My fall semester one got fired and the one I had this semester was SO much better. As a result, I did better this semester as well. \r\nA lot of work though if you want to do well and have never taken economics like me. Don't expect to receive a lot of help from anyone....READ THE TEXTBOOK! Get a tutor early on because they do run out (shows you how poorly managed the class is)","Don't do it.","If you took Mirco in the fall, then Marco is not that much different in terms of structure and how it is run. I had no economics background from high school. In terms of the learning the material, I hardly touched the textbook and most of what I learned came from doing PSETs. I also took the time to understand the correct answers posted for both the PSETs and practice problems for tests. Go to section because there will be much more information that will not appear in the book. Other than that practice, practice, practice!","Definitely knowledge required for leading a more aware life -- even if you pick up a newspaper, you will recognize many things you went over in class. This is a class you should take regardless of your grade or concentration!","This is class is not fun. It is hard and you have to have interest in economics in order to do well.","You cover a lot of material so it's important to stay on top of things.  It's basically a boring course that does give you a fairly solid economics background.","Ec 10 really teaches you about the world around you in the view of economics. Although it has it's faults, it will teach you how to look at economic issues with an analytical eye and I really feel I've learned a lot from it.","Lectures: sometimes interesting, irrelevant to the material taught\r\nSection: where you learn course material, depends greatly on TF, graded based on performance compared to section\r\nProblem Sets: time consuming, but equivalent to material on exams\r\nExams: challenging, usually nicely curved\r\nOffice Hours: go to David Johnson's, you'll do much better in the class, guaranteed","This class is not nearly as good as it should be, but you also don't really have any choice about it because it's the entry level economics class.","This class gets a bad rep for no reason. I do understand that some TFs aren't the best, but if the material piques your interest (something that you should try and gauge during reading week), I actually think that it is taught quite well. Mankiw's textbook sets up most of Econ in a logical and smart fashion. Be prepared to work: read the book and understand the Psets, or else the course will be substantially more difficult.","I took this class pass\/fail, which I think is a great idea to do if you can.   It allowed me to get the major points of economics so I now understand the news and understood the presidential debates much better, while having it be low stress because it is incredibly easy to pass.  I think ec is great class that every undergrad should take to know for themselves and this is really the only way to do it at Harvard. Taking it pass\/fail allowed me to study minimally, do most of the psets and still easily pass.","Better hope your TF is good. If so, you're in luck. I had a great study group, a great TF, and generally a great time in Ec 10. The tests were a wreck, but hey, I understand the material so I guess I'm okay. Take the class.","This course provides many of the resources, all that it takes is a lot of organization and much dedication to excel.","If you are at all interested in economics, you should definitely take this class. You learn a lot the subject and the textbook is easy to read. Having said that, this class isn't for everyone because sections are often dull and problem sets are very challenging and require a lot of time to complete.","This is a good class to take because it teaches you a lot you will use in the real world.","you learn so much, but the extent of your takeaway depends on how much time you put in","If you have any interest in economics, you should take this class. The material you learn is relevant to your life, especially the guest lectures. Don't be taken by surprise -- this is not a large, easy freshman class. That being said, the work is manageable if you budget your time well.","This course is challenging and frustrating. Although you will learn a good deal of economics, the problem sets and exams require a level of expertise that is difficult to acquire through section alone. In order to do well you have to either be naturally gifted or attend all the office hours and spend an unnatural amount of time working with the book\/review materials.","Take this course if you have the slightest interest in Economics. Your TF might be the worst TF there is, but there is always David Johnson! Go to his office hours, talk to him, ask him anything you want, he is a very good TF and teacher, and knows how to explain concepts very well.","Do the readings! They tell you everything you need to now for the course.","Ec 10 is an amazing class. Every undergraduate at Harvard (particularly those interested in politics or public service) should take it. It provides a fair, balanced introduction to the principles of economics. If you want to be taken seriously when debating economic issues, you have to know this stuff.","the material isn't 'riveting', but does build you a very solid economic foundation if you want to take more upper level ec courses, and\/or you want a basic understanding of the economic context we live in.","This class is amazing for anyone interested in economics and important for anyone just looking for an elective.","Even if you have no plans to concentrate in economics, or no love for the discipline itself, every student would benefit from at least a basic understanding of economic theory.","Ec10 can be difficult if you're not solid on math\/graphing, but it's worth the time you put into it to understand the economy. As far as grades go, they try to help you out with a curve and the Unit Test system, so I wouldn't let that be a deciding factor in whether or not you take the class.","Great way to get to know freshmen. Try to switch out of section quick if you don't like your TF.","It is an interesting intro class.","David Johnson is an asset to this class. He and the bond market will never betray you! I believe that he deserves to be teaching at Sanders as well.","This class covers lots of information but is very helpful in providing a strong foundation in economics.","Incredibly valuable basic knowledge to have","Take it even if you have already taken AP Econ. There are some topics like trade barriers that are covered in this course. If you have taken AP Econ, this will be an easy A.","Stay on top of your work and do the unit tests.","great class to take even if your not concentrating in economics","If you want to get an introduction to Economics, this course goes a bit past that, but regardless, it is still interesting.","If you want knowledge about the economy that far surpasses what any other economics course in the country can offer, take ec 10. If you want to be informed about the Fed's actions, about fiscal policy, about the bond market, this course provides you with the terminology and skill set to intelligently discuss what is going on in the world today.","Its a good class to take - it will provide you with a solid understanding of how the world works, and I think that a basic knowledge of economics is crucial.","It's a useful introduction to the material of economics and it does a fair job of explaining the material clearly and concisely.","Ec10 is your standard large lecture course. Most people take it because they think they should, rather than out of a love for economics.","This class is a useful class and the lectures are really interesting, but you will have to learn almost all of the actual content from reading the textbook and doing problem sets. It's not the greatest class at Harvard but I would still say it's definitely worth taking.","TAKE IT! It's difficult but it's worth it! It's a great learning experience and David Johnson is a awesome Head TF. Go to his office hours, take the unit tests, etc. Use the resources they offer so you can really master the material! It's a great class if you budget the time to dedicate to it.","The macro econ part of EC10 is more fun than the micro","If you get a bad TF, drop the class. Most TFs are bad.","That it is hard.","Make sure you read the book and all the helpful hints--seriously.","I think that it's incredibly useful to learn the information covered in Ec 10, but if you aren't really looking to commit to the full year, perhaps seek a more enjoyable elective and review the material on your own.","This is a great course to learn basic Economics. Everyone should take this course, as knowing some economics is crucial in everyday life. The problem sets and exams can be brutal at times, and a lot of preparation and work is necessary to do well on them. However, you'll be proud of the work you've put in when you've completed this course.","Be sure to read the green boxes","difficult but very useful in life","This class is mandatory for economics concentrators (unless you pass out of it because of the AP test), so most will have to take it. This class definitely gives a good overview to economics, but it can be tedious at times. The class is huge, but you don't know that because you rarely have lectures. But, that means you meet in section a lot. Teaching quality varies greatly by section. This is one component of the class that is unfair. If you realize early that you do not have a good TF try and think of an excuse to switch sections. The tests are tough, but the homework isn't terrible, just time consuming and sometimes tedious.","Economics 10 should be a graduation requirement. The material is extremely engaging and relevant. If you read the textbook, start problem sets ahead of time, and take the unit tests, Ec10 should be a great experience.","As a junior taking the course, I definitely felt like this class was a quintessential intro course - you learn a lot and they make exams fairly difficult to get a good distribution. Overall, great course, and I'm glad I took it even though it wasn't really related to my concentration. Read the book, ask questions, do the unit tests, and don't fall behind.","Such an important course to take at Harvard. I feel so much smarter having taken this class and it helps me understand and view the world in a whole new way.  It's a must.","Go to David Johnson's office hours","Be prepared to learn in section and go to office hours!","Do not take this course because you will come out feeling disheartened","#DavidJohnson'sReviewSession","Ec10 is what you make out of it-- you can grumble through the psets or you can use them as a great tool for relating what you're learning in class to real world issues! You can use office hours or you can let them pass you by. If I could do it over again, I would invest more in the class. The material can be really interesting if you get into it!","It's Ec 10. I took it just for the sake of taking an economics class (and for the gen ed credit I suppose), which I wouldn't recommend doing. I expected to learn more about how economics works in real life; this class is a lot of drawing graphs and solving problems based on very simplified models that make a lot of assumptions that don't really hold in real life. The quality of your experience probably depends a lot on your TF. I didn't really go to section so I mostly learned from the textbook, which is very well written; it's totally sufficient for first semester, but there are a lot of concepts discussed second semester that aren't really covered in the textbook.","Ec 10 teaches a lot of concepts that are certainly important and relevant. Some parts of it are more exciting than others, but they really do a good job of trying to make sure that you really understand everything thoroughly. This means that sometimes the tests and problem sets are a bit tricky but you'll be glad you did it.","Tests are hard","what you hear is generally correct. Mankiw doesn't teach the course, and it's kind of a pain to deal with.","Go to david johnson office hours!!! he is an amazing guy and makes everything make sense. taking this course will really change the way you see the world","Everyone should take it.","Good class, not great.","It's the quintessential havard freshman course. Don't miss out on it.","Keep up with the reading and go to section.","Take it, you will learn a lot. But it is poorly run.","This is a class that every single Harvard undergraduate should take. It's not that hard, and if you've never taken a class like it before, you'll learn a lot. The textbook and problem sets are well thought out and written, and the teaching staff is very capable. Every concept is explained with impressive clarity. Your mileage may vary depending on your TF, but in the end, you can learn the concepts very easily just on your own with the textbooks and problem sets. Take Ec 10! You won't regret it.","This course is a great course to take no matter if you plan on concentrating in Economics or not. Definitely one of my favorite classes that I've taken here.","Just do the psets on your own and do the reading before section. You will have to do everything eventually but will be 10 times more difficult if you delay...","The stuff taught in this class is definitely stuff that every human being needs to know about how the world works. Although you'll find yourself often frustrated with the over-structured programming of the class and the infrequent appearances of your professor, the challenging nature of the exams and the problem sets will give you a truly synthesized (as David Johnson likes to put it) understanding of the key economic concepts.","Get ahead on the psets, they are brutal.","Ec10 is what you would expect of Ec10. It is an extremely large course that is mostly taught by section leaders; however, there is still a lot to learn from it. Ec10 does not merely teach economic theory and memorization, but rather actually makes you think and apply economic methods to real world problems. In this sense David Johnson does an excellent job of crafting challenging questions. Even though you may be confident with the material after sitting in section or reading the textbook, problem sets and tests will challenge you, so I would recommend Ec10 to everyone considering skipping into Ec1010 or Ec1011.","Whatever you end up studying and doing in life, a general understanding of the principles of economics will make you a much more capable member of society.","This is an awesome class.  take if you are interested in economics","You need to study 5 plus days for all midterms and the final. The material is turned around and made much more difficult on exams.","Great class! The experience might not be that great (as it is hyped up) but you will definitely walk out feeling strong and good about what you learn. You actually get intuition from this class and that's amazing.","This class is shitty.","Everyone should take this course! The material is so relevant to real life, even if you are not interested in concentrating.","It's Ec 10. You'll have to take it anyway. Try to make the most of the course, there are a ton of potential career pathways that are opened through taking this course."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course has been a good, all around introduction to economics. I think it serves its purpose quite well without going far beyond that. But overall certainly satisfying.","Make sure that you utilize every resource they give you\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cproblem set solutions, helpful hints, textbook, practice tests-- and don't think you can get away with not knowing or understanding a concept. The course tests every concept, so utilize people like David Johnson's office hours if you don't feel confident about a particular topic or need help on a problem set question.","Read the textbook before section.","Honestly if you are trying to satisfy the GenEd by taking Econ10a and 10b, DON\"T DO IT. It is a complete waste of your time if you don't actually plan on going into economics.","Ec 10 is one of THOSE courses - one of the ones tons of people take (especially freshmen) on entering the university and when trying to decide on a concentration. That being said, it can be helpful to experience such a large course that also provides the small section component. It is definitely a good introductory course in economics and will be helpful for a multitude of concentrations.","It's a pity that basically anyone with any interest in anything economic (not to mention a number of other concentrations) HAS to take this course. It's not awful, but it's nothing to get enthusiastic about (at least as it's structure now). The course gives you information and expects you to regurgitate it. Sometimes it pretends to ask you to think for yourself.","This class is challenging but effective in teaching you the basic concepts of economics. I've learned so much--psets and midterms challenge you to understand concepts and principles in a real and flexible way. Meanwhile, lectures and readings apply these concepts to the real world and introduce you to the nuances of intersections between economics, politics, and industry.","Its a lot of work, but so worth it","Totally fine, a little soulless, but not too painful!","It is very informative and interesting.","Only take this class if you absolutely have to. The Mankiw lectures are useless and having been to various sections, the section leaders cannot teach the material well. Everyone raves about David Johnson being a gem in this class, but honestly all he does in his office hours is yell and teach economic concepts that, while very meaningful for real life, will never appear on problem sets or exams.","This class isn't just a course. It actually is very useful and it's important to have a good understanding of economics to be aware of what is going on around you politically, socially, and fiscally.","a lot of work. if you don't have a good TF, you will have to teach yourself from the textbook","A good foundation for economics.  Not too much work and tests are not that tough (they are all heavily scaled)","GO for office hours.","Balance out your course load  and go to all of the unit exams","It is a very useful and interesting class that I definitely recommend, but I feel like enjoyment in it is heavily based on your TF. It is almost entirely taught in section, so your TF's ability to teach and make things engaging is essential, but I had a great experience in this regard and really loved my TF. The material is very useful and I think it includes important concepts to understand even if you're not thinking about concentrating in economics, especially because intro econ courses like this just help you analyze the world a little differently. Mankiw is very much a figurehead, but David Johnson (the Head TF) is amazing. Lectures in general are really nice because they allow you to hear from other Harvard Ec Professor, which could give you ideas of classes to take in the future. Also, the workload is manageable, but if you save problem sets for the night before they're due, you will often find yourself pulling all-nighters.","This class is hard, but worth it. You come out with a very solid understanding of economic concepts. Although I had already taken AP Micro\/Macro Economics and could have skipped this course, I found it to be an incredible review of introductory concepts. The guest lectures are also extremely informative and a great way to learn about current research going on in the field of economics.","The class can be difficult, especially coming in without any economics background, but it is manageable. Go to the Unit tests if at all possible, and starting studying for the midterms well in advance of the date.","Having a good section leader makes all the difference in the world. I had a great one Freshman Fall and she did a great job of helping us understand the course material both in section and during her office hours.","Ec 10 is what it is. Don't let anyone tell you it's easy, it's not. But, it also isn't terrible. Some of the lectures were very interesting and I feel better for having learned it. Be prepared to spend time on this class. Go to office hours, read the book and work hard on Psets. Economics is something everyone should at least have a basic knowledge of and this class definitely does this. I don't like it. I don't loathe it. It just is.","This course is one of the worst taught courses here at Harvard. It is 100% dependent on which TF you get because despite what we learned in the guest lectures - being taught in small class rooms doesnt help, and being taught in a bigger classrooom with a better professor does help, We DONT DO THAT. They need to just have Johnston teach the class in a huge lecture hall. My TF did not seem to know much about economics and cared even less about teaching it to us.","I mean, its an entry level course so it's not the most interesting material, but its not bad and you need it for anything econ.","It's your standard introductory course - a lot of the course is routine, but I'm not sure how else it could be taught.","Take this class if you are interested in economics or if you need to fulfill a requirement.","If you're interested in ec, have not taken it before, or it counts for something, I'd recommend it. It contains a lot of interesting material if you'd like to learn it.","The class pretty much depends on your TF. Luckily my TF was awesome and she provided us with assistance when we needed it. She was also very clear in class and I think that's what helped reinforce most of the concepts. Problem sets can sometimes be vague, but you just get over it eventually.","Take it; it will broaden your horizons","I think it is important that every student at Harvard learn the basics of economics, and for that reason I highly recommend it. Despite that, the course can be very difficult at times. Some of the psets, especially, are difficult.","I would recommend this class to all students. It is a nice entry course to the field of economics. The concepts were interesting and applicable to the real world. The exams were challenging yet doable, and the problem sets were extremely helpful in preparing me for the level of difficulty of the exam questions. The only negative side to this course were that some of the lectures weren't as engaging as I hoped.","This course is not intuitive. I recommend that you take it because I think that it is important to have a basic understanding of economics. However, the teaching staff was completely unhelpful to me, and the book explained nothing that was helpful to completing the psets. I had a college preparatory background of economics, but it was not satisfactory enough to make this course easy. I highly recommend David Johnson's office hours and review sessions. Youtube instructors will become your friends, but remember to not neglect the helpful hints (which are sent from the god that is David Johnson).","A class that helps gives an educational, analytical context for you to view things you already had some general understanding of.","You'll learn microeconomics, but you may not have the most fun doing so.  It's pretty straight out of the textbook--you read it, you practice it, you learn it.  No surprises.","ec10 is really about teaching you to think like an economist to tackle problems large and small. The toolset of economics is practical and useful in everyday life.","Don't go in thinking that you'll be given special treatment -- or really any personal treatment at all. Ec 10 is a factory. If you do most of your learning on your own time, good for you. If you go in hoping to get anything out of the classes, sorry.","keep up with your reading and keep accurate notes and the class isnt a problem","I believe it is important for everybody to have a strong understanding of basic economic theory. However, the theory this course teaches is sometimes abstract and does not always correlate with what actually occurs in the real world.","it's not so exciting, but material is valuable","This course is a good introduction to microeconomics, but it is very similar to the material taught in AP Economics in high school, and the class is very large, but without the support network or community of a class like CS50.","You'll be reading the textbook a lot. Spend lots of time on Psets, go to office hours, and practice a lot for the tests. You'll really want to master the stuff on the psets b\/c the tests are literally just 2 pset questions and 20 multiple choice.","David Johnson is a god","Mankiw is incredibly conservative. This colors his lectures. Be aware of this, as he tries to leave political leanings out of it, but they seep through every so often.","Team up and utilize peers as resources if you expect to be successful in the course. Attend office hours. The bulk of the knowledge will be learned while working on problem sets, reading helpful hints, and section notes.","It's a very interesting class and should be a class everyone should take at some point in there college careers","Everyone should take this course at some point in their Harvard career. The concepts are pretty fundamental and the material is not that challenging.","Most of what you learn will be really up to how much effort you put in. The lectures may not really be all that helpful, but the psets are a great way to learn.","You learn a lot in Ec10. I would highly recommend it for someone who has never taken an economics class before. The problem sets and midterms are challenging but are definitely manageable if you put in the work.","It is a good class.","The subject matter is very interesting, and if you have a bad TF that can be tough but you hsould stick with it.","Its not bad. Freshmen freak out about it, but its a typical college class. Read the book.","A difficult class that's probably worth taking regardless of whether it counts towards your concentration","Form study groups with one\/two people from your section. Make sure to compare section progress with friends from other sections and take unit tests. The course isn't extremely organized but has a lot to offer, so branch out as much as you can.","It takes time to practice problems and read the textbook well, but it's such essential information!","Ec 10 provides you with a base of understanding that allows you to better comprehend material in history and government courses, and it gives you the basic tools to look at current events and political debates with more insight.","Economics is an incredibly useful discipline to know a little bit about. Unfortunately, at Harvard, one can only enter the subject (barring having taken the AP exam, which I'd recommend except not everyone has the chance) through Ec10, which is practically the quintessential Harvard class. Large sizes, disengaged professor, a mixed bag of TFs and lecturers (some utterly brilliant, and some not so much), overeager students keen on finance who wants the grades rather than critically think on the subtle slant on economics that is being presented to us, going over problems and definitions in a manner of teaching that's very reminiscent of high school. Take it if it's a necessary intro course for you, if not, skip to 1010 or move on. Economics is fascinating, and you do get that from the course, but none of that is due to the course itself.","I think that ec10 is an incredibly useful class with applicable skills but I don't think that anybody really enjoys taking it.","If you don't know anything about economics you will learn a lot, but the section-taught structure of this class is so terrible it is enough to consider not taking this course.","Although difficult, the class is incredibly enriching; I feel every student should take Economics 10a","Ec10 is a really big course. Be prepared to actively go out and ask for help when you're lost. And try your best to go to David Johnson's office hours. He's amazing","Great course if you put in the work. Interesting material that is useful to know.","I would highly recommend the use of Khan Academy as reinforcement.","Meh. Ec 10 is just one of those courses you have to take to get further in your economic studies. The material that you learn is certainly useful in real-life applications and is good to know in order to understand the world around us, the way in which it is taught in Ec 10 is not ideal. There is just too great of a disconnect between what is taught in section and what is expected of you in problem sets. And the class is more time-consuming than necessary with tediously long problem sets and \"optional\" unit tests that you really have to do if you want to do well.","This introductory economics course provides a broad approach to very interesting concepts.","This course is difficult but interesting, and if you apply yourself you will come out of the course with much good knowledge.","Tough but worth it","Although I wish that EC 10 had taken less of my time this semester (I believe it took time away from the classes I truly wanted to focus on), I would still say it's a class worth taking. It was challenging and difficult for me, but I am ultimately glad I took the course.","The course itself a lot harder than AP Economics, although it is about the same materials. The problem sets are very well designed to further your understanding of the subject.","This course is a great introduction to economics. It's very exciting and interesting.","Ec10 is a great course to take as a concentration prerequisite or out of general interest. However given the number of students who take the course, it is important not to underestimate the difficulty of problem sets and exams. Attending office hours (both with your TF and David Johnson) are very helpful, and it is important to gain an instinctive understanding of material.","It gives you a great perspective about the world in general and makes you think about basic decision making in a new manner.","Prepare to be disappointed, but recognize that this is an essential introductory course for a lot of areas in the social sciences.","its a self taught class","ONLY take this class if you're pretty sure you have an interest in economics. I took this class because \"it's good to know some economics to function in the world,\" and I ended up hating it with a passion. Unless you like econ, the material is pretty dry, and problem sets especially are a pain. Concepts are taught in section, but I feel that we were not taught adequately how to apply those concepts to the problems. The class also doesn't have a very study network-y feel to it; it feels as if you're thrown on your own to learn, so be prepared to do a lot of self-teaching. Also keep in mind that it's taught entirely in section so your experience depends almost wholly on your TF - I had an excellent TF, so that wasn't the problem, it was the curriculum. The textbook, however, is very accessible and informative, so if you want to learn some about econ but aren't sure if you're interested, just read the book, don't take the class. The best part about Ec 10 was the lectures, which were on fascinating real-world topics and how economics can be extended to apply to them, and I did enjoy those a lot.","This class is really interesting and is a really good introduction to economics. The lectures are given by famous economists and put what you are learning in class in real world context. Most of the course material is taught in section, so if your TF is good ,then the class is awesome. The problem sets and the tests aren't too hard, but I would definitely recommend reading and keeping up with the textbook chapters.","If you're taking this class it's either (1) because you have to or (2) because you're a freshman who things he\/she wants to concentrate in Economics.  In either case, I know that my advice won't have much merit, but I would just say that you should walk into Ec10 with good study habits, as the exams can really kick your ass if you aren't ready.  So, DONT save psets to 1AM the night before, DONT start studying with 12 hours to the exam, and DONT ever take for granted that you'll get a good grade in this class. Have fun with it, and you'll be surprised how much you'll learn!","This class was very time consuming. I had to go to office hours several times a week and work every day on the pset and stayed up very late every time it was due. The cycle of psets never seems to end.","Ec10 is a great way to get initial exposure to economics-- I thought I would hate it but actually liked it a lot! It's a huge class and it won't be life-changing or super inspirational, but it's good to learn and not that bad.","I don't quite understand all of the hate Ec 10 gets. It's an intro class primarily taught in section, sure.  Mankiw is not the teacher of the class, your section leader is. But this is still a great class, with well organized and fascinating material, which I think really changes the way you think about the world.","Although this course is an \"introduction\" to Economics, succeeding is only possible if you are entering the course with previous experience in the field (especially an AP course). I didn't take AP Economics before enrolling in Ec10, and I found the course very difficult to keep up with. The weekly problem sets usually take a very long time to complete, and the extra credit opportunities that are meant to help are only available at very inconvenient times. Also, the subject material that is reviewed in section and in course-wide review rarely appears on the examinations. Overall, I found this course to be far more advanced than what I expected of an introductory level, and organized in a way where the aspects meant to make the class more enjoyable worsened its quality.","While section may be confusing depending on the TF lottery, try to keep up with the readings and problem sets.  The problems in the sets are reflective of those on exams; note the graphs in the textbooks.  If you have any questions, Head TF David Johnson is truly one of your greatest resources and one of the greatest parts of the class, who will undoubtably help and motivate you.","This course is what it is. It is not the most fascinating course you will take in your time at Harvard, but it's fine. Really depends on how good your TF is. The guest lectures are good. If you are taking it to satisfy the math requirement: beware. It's not easy and will suck up two semesters of your year if you want the GenEd credit. Just take math instead!","This course is a must-take at Harvard no matter your concentration. It is insightful and offers reasons why society works the way it does.","Great class if you've got an awesome section leader like I did. If there are any other freshmen who are mathy and gotten double 5s on APs: note that Ec1011a is really tough (<10 freshmen in the class), but Ec 10a will be a lot of review. You might consider just not taking Econ this year and taking Ec1011a next year. I chose to do Ec10a for an easy class to balance other classes and also cover a GenEd, and don't regret my choice personally.","It is extremely important to take this course at some point as an undergraduate!","This class is a bit of work but the content is very interesting","Lectures are great.   Go to them.  Most of the material is fairly easy but enjoyable to learn.","This was a required course for my concentration. Who you have for a TF really makes or breaks the course. It's also really necessary that you go to section and office hours","Your typical foundational economics class","The class all depends on your section leader. If you have a leader who explains the concepts well, this course will be a good experience and very manageable.","It's a very interesting class to take if you have the slightest interest in economics or even if you're just curious to know more about how today's world works. But to be honest your success in it depends a lot on the TF that you get assigned to, so cross your fingers! Also, a word of advice would be to start your psets early and go to D. Johnson's office hours, it helps a lot. Other than that, I'd say you should keep up with the readings, although it might seem silly cause your TF goes through most of it again in class at least you'll be prepared and what he says will allow you to memorize it; you can also ask him about stuff you didn't understand.","Take this course only for Gen Ed requirements or if you are concentrating in Economics. If you are looking for an elective, there are many other ec courses that are much better.","Ec10 is a classic college intro course in that relies on subject matter and not teaching to entice students to take it. You have to rely on your section TF to truly learn the subject. Having a good or bad TF will make or break your Ec10 experience. It's possible to get through this class without going to any sections (other than to hand in Psets) but a good TF really helps you learn the material better. Don't take as an elective. You won't get that much out of it because it doesn't delve to deep into real world matters.","You may hate this class; you may love it. But it's good to have a background in economics, at least at a basic level. Even if you hate this class, it's a good idea to take it at some point.","That it is tougher than most people let on to be","Economics is such an awesome topic, but this course is too big for its own good. It's like food that could be delicious but loses its flavor when mass-produced.","Economics is a useful life skill. Ec10 isn't anything exciting, but the workload is reasonable, and you can do well as long as you keep up with the problem sets and reading.","This class is pretty boring but easy to get a B\/B+. If you want an A be prepared to work hard and do all the unit tests.","It's very challenging but worthwhile in the end. When the going gets tough, it helps to take a step back and realize you're learning economics from the best professors in the world at the best college in the world.","There is a certain culture surrounding the course; many people want to go into finance or consulting which can be irritating.","Take this class if you want to learn the basics of economics. Expect to put in a decent amount of work (2-4 hours per week), but nothing excessive as long as you attend section\/lectures.","Ec 10 is a solid foundation to understand some of the most important ways in which the world works. If you're considering being an Ec concentrator, Ec 10 does a great job showing you what economics can be used for in many different fields.","Take this class, but choose your section carefully. You'll learn a lot no matter what, but you may have to work harder at it.","I would not take this class unless you are planning to get some concentration or secondary in it.  Otherwise, you need it.","Take it if you want to concentrate in Ec, take it just because it's useful to have a general knowledge of economics in life, but don't think that this generalized and simplified version of economics will have any relation to anything that exists outside of the classroom.","This is, without a single doubt, the WORST class I have EVER taken at Harvard. A complete travesty. In fact, I would even throw it out there that this is the worst class at this school, because it is hard to imagine that a more awful class exists. The only reason you would even consider thinking about possibly taking this dire class is if you are convinced that you want to become an Economics concentrator or if you are the unfortunate Social Studies concentrator who is forced to endure it because it is a requirement. Basically, if you have no choice. The class is too big and incredibly impersonal, Marglin is a boring and not engaging lecturer, the problem sets are impossible to do without a lot of hand-holding and going to office hours every week, the exams are way too difficult given the basic level TFs are instructed to teach at in section and the textbook is pretty much useless (bar the graphs). The ONLY redeeming qualities of the class are some of the guest lecturers and David Jonhnson, who is clearly a genius. Here are some tips for getting through the class if you choose to subject yourself to this misery: go to office hours every week to do your problem sets, do the Unit Tests, go to David Johnson's office hours and review sessions and when studying for the exams go over the HELPFUL HINTS. Seriously, forget the textbook, focus primarily on the Helpful Hints documents and previous exams. Overall, this class was the bane of my semester and though ultimately I did okay grade-wise, I definitely felt that effort did not equal the result and I felt strongly enough about it to write a pretty scathing evaluation. Do not take it unless you have no choice. Worst. Class. Ever.","You can't graduate without having taken at least one Ec class at Harvard, and Ec10 does a great introductory job.","If math is not your strong suit and you would like a greater understanding of how the economy works, this is the class for you.","Even though you'll often feel swamped, do all the reading.  Read the textbook and the helpful hints.  If you take the time to keep up with all of this throughout the semester, you can avoid the last minute panic that so many people go through before each exam.","It is a very doable class that can help you decide whether economics is for you.","Make sure you don't fall behind in this course. I truly didn't enjoy the material. Also the assignments are very time intensive.","This class is a must take to understand the world.","If you aren't thinking about majoring.  In economics, I highly discourage this claass. It did bot meet my expectations in many ways.","Take time to do the textbook reading for homework. It doesn't take long and it helps a ton in really understanding the concepts, which becomes necessary for exams when the questions are a lot harder than the examples shown in class.","I would recommend this class because economics is an interesting topic and something useful to learn.","I took this class without any background in economics and came out with a good overview of the basic concepts of economics. Very good intro course.","A lot of people just hate this course -- that's a pretty founded opinion. It's not fun or interesting, except for the occasional fascinating guest lecturer.","Good class to take but prepared to put in the time on the PSETs.  If you don't understand a concept one week, be sure to go to your TF or David Johnson's office hours to get it clarified.","Great intro course that builds many friendships on days before Psets are due. Not an easy class and should not be taken without warning that it is difficult.","Your experience in the course is completely dependent on the TF you receive. If your TF is bad like mine was GO TO DAVID JOHNSON'S office hours. He is brilliant.","Do it if you have to for concentration.","If you're not an ec person, this class is hell. And it all depends on which TF you have. The exams are easier than the psets. Go to DJ's review sessions and office hours.","I would tell them that it was a very good experience that taught me a lot about the fundamentals about economics if I wanted to further concentrate in it.","This class is extremely interesting and useful! Take it and you will not regret it!","If one is interested in Economics and has no background, this is the course to take. If not, it is probably not worth taking.","This class is taken by almost everyone so finding a study group isn't hard. I didn't particularly like the class and thought that the variation in teaching between sections was a bit too much. Some students were taught very well and others weren't, simply based on luck of the draw.","I was really nervous about taking this class because I had never taken economics before and I didn't really have any desire to study it, but I thought it was something I should take because everyone should have some knowledge of economics, and I am so glad I did. It was definitely less daunting than I originally anticipated, and while I stayed up very late some nights finishing the problem sets, I really enjoyed working with others in the class, and overall, my experience was very positive. Because almost the entire class is taught in section, the TF you get is extremely important, and I was so lucky to have Trisha.","You have to be willing to either collaborate with others on the psets or put in a solid amount of work by yourself.","It's an interesting and basic knowledge of economics that should be known by everyone.","It's a grind and a lot of it you kind of have to figure out yourself. There is a disconnect between the reading and the psets","Its awesome! Economics is something that everyone should study and understand at least at a basic level no matter what they plan to concentrate in","Good class if you've never taken econ before or only have a basic understanding. If you've taken AP econ or a similar level course, you may feel bored in Ec10","Skim readings, pay attention in sections, go to all the lectures, go to office hours, and work independently on Psets.","The materials are interesting but the structure of this class is deplorable. What you take from the class really depends on the TF, not Mankiw. Some lucky few have the head TF. Take it if you have an interest in economics but don't feel like you have to take it.","think very carefully about taking this course and your reasons for taking this course.  Unless you have a background\/interest in pursuing economics academically or you are satisfying a concentration requirement of some kind, I would most definitely think twice about taking it to gain any kind of pure economic knowledge.  While it is advertised as accessible to all (even as an introductory class) it most definitely is not for everyone.","It is the worst ever","It's good to take this course to gain a fundamental understanding of economics, but you have to be aware that it's a little bit one-sided, on the conservative side.","You learn the basics in this course, but it is not fun. I really didn't like it, so I would take it if you think this is really what you want to do. If it is a last priority, you probably won't do well. Very difficult to get an A","The ideas and concepts in Ec10 were interesting to me, but the class is very hard. Not a course to take lightly.","Take it!! It changes the way you think about your decisions and how the world works. Go to David Johnson's OH","Read the textbook and practice practice practice","it's popular for a reason\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6","Don't fall behind on the readings. Instead, come to section prepared in order to get the most out of it.","Between Expos and CS50 in difficulty.\r\n\r\nExams are rigorous.\r\n\r\nTaught by TFs.","The class is huge and is mostly taught in section. However, you will be tested on the lectures through midterms and exams. How much you like this class mostly depends on your section leader, which is based entirely off of luck. Luckily, I had a great section leader who really wanted everyone to succeed and understand the material but there are definitely some TFs who have no idea what they are talking about or are no help to the students at all so it is a risky business.","Micro can be a bit inapplicable at times but I would recommend this course because conceptually this course if very fascinating looking at consumer before and how markets effect different firms.","Since it is a requirement for many different majors, the course is over-enrolled and unorganized. It attempts to provide a solid foundation in a class that requires immediate attention by teachers with experience which is not something that they can provide.","This is a moderately challenging class. The p-sets can be tricky, but fortunately students are encouraged to collaborate and work in groups to solve them.","Know what they expect of you and be able to explain things clearly.","This is a class that I think everyone should take.  It is very well done with a very interesting subject matter that explains how the world works.","Be prepared for a great deal of work, every week.","Very applicable to the real world. Highly recommend this course even if you're not going to be an econ major. David Johnson is also great. His sections and reviews are excellent. Lectures are much more dry and not interesting. Decent amount of work but definitely worth it.","Great class. Problem sets can take a while but not nearly as bad as other classes like CS50","The lectures are interesting but be prepared to be underwhelmed in section. Go to office hours with questions about psets since psets are not addressed in section.","make sure you get a good section\/tf","I really loved econ in high school and I really did NOT like it here. I don't know if it's the way the course is taught or my section in particular, but I did not enjoy this class. The work was doable and the concepts were not too difficult to understand, but the questions on psets and tests made everything seem much more complicated. I'm sure a lot of people loved this class, but I kind of dreaded it.","Chances are you may not get lucky enough to have a TF like David Johnson that you can learn a lot from, so make sure you stay on top of the reading and you will be able to teach yourself what you need to know.","Make sure you do the pSets yourself! Absolutely do NOT let someone else turn the problem set in for you - groups of 3 can submit work together - without understanding the material yourself.  You will drown in material when trying to study for midterms and most importantly, none of the material will stick.","I think economics is an incredibly important field to understand. However, I would encourage people to avoid this class at all costs. It's a drag of a class and is thoroughly unenjoyable. I will only continue taking it so that I can gain the skills that the class helps one obtain.","Take it.","If you're thinking about economics as a concentration, or just want to gain a general understanding of what economies entail and how they work, this is a good course to take. However, a lot of your experience will depend on which TF you get. There are a couple lectures that are absolutely great.","Ec 10a can be very interesting for those who give it a chance. There is not much work. The problem sets can be challenging, but they are not worth much and you can attend your TF's office hours for help.","If you want to concentrate in Economics, take it; if you don't, then read some books and learn the same amount.","This class teaches you economics, plain and simple.  It starts easy, with common sense supply and demand, and transitions into some marginally harder topics.  Nothing too hard.  If you don't have a good TF, just read the textbook, everything's well explained in there.  If you have a good TF, you're golden.","This course is very important (the material is), however, the class itself can be a bit dry at times.","Don't get behind and go to office hours.","The course is extremely hard and the material is taught quickly. I regret taking the class because I did not take any economics courses in high school, which would have been extremely helpful to do. The lectures are interesting and the book is easy to understand, but the tests are extremely hard and the p-sets take a very long time to complete.","This class is poorly structured and Manikew is the worst. He shows up to three lectures, so your ability to do well in this class is determined by the proficiency of your TF, which can be a hit or miss. The class also has an observable conservative skew in the textbook and when Manikew takes the stage; however, the fundamentals of economics are important to everyday live and are worth learning.","It's absolutely useful material!","Don't try to do this course without going to office hours every week. Really understand the P-Sets and you'll be fine on the midterms\/final.","This class made me angry.","I had heard from a lot of my friends who'd taken Ec10 that it was a really awful class.  After having done the first semester, though, I'm not really sure why so many people hated it so much.  I thought it was a well organized class with a clear and well-written textbook and a lot of supplemental resources.  The Helpful Hints in particular were really useful.  Psets and exams weren't easy but I definitely felt they were very doable with a little bit of work.  Overall thought it was a really solid class.","Unless you are genuinely interested in economics or want to concentrate in it, do not take this class with the expectation that it will raise your GPA.","While it can be challenging, it's worth knowing basic economics, and this class will definitely teach that to you.","Economics 10 is well-designed for students with little background knowledge of the field; I came into the course without any prior experience and am now strongly considering concentrating in ec.  Take this course!","Definitely a good introduction to micro. It doesn't have that conservative bias that people say it does\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis is positive not normative economics!","It will teach you how the world works and for that reason, everyone should take this course. I would encourage you not to get bogged down in the minutiae as the course does but focus on the bigger real-life principles and applications behind the theories.","Attend and pay attention to all course-wide lectures","The class is extremely difficult to keep up with and if you happen to fall behind there is nearly no way of catching back up. The lectures are uninteresting and most of the learning has to be done without the help of teachers.","The course teachers a lot of valuable information about the economic system we live under. However, it moves very quickly every week so make sure that you have time to study for it. The PSETS take many hours to complete and it is useful to go see your TF for help. It's a big course so you are competing with a lot of students for individual attention.","Skip it.","I wish there were a better option for introduction to economics at Harvard, but there currently isn't. Until that day, take this class.","you just have to take this class.. you won't enjoy the class but the topic is interesting","Be sure to get a good TF - that will really make or break your semester.","Go to David Johnson's sections, it is the best way to learn problem solving and the material.","Go to lecture, the questions are easy points on the exams that you will not know otherwise","I think economics is important to learn, no matter what you plan on studying. I came into Harvard thinking I would be pre-med, but then switched routes and took Ec10 my sophomore year, wishing someone would have told me to take it last year, just in case. If you're on the fence, definitely take this class and drop it after the first semester if it's not for you.","It's a great class, but a lot of it does depend on which TF you get. You have problem sets every week, but they aren't that bad and you can always go to office hours for help.","This course is a strong way to start your understanding of microeconomics, but Mankiw skews things in a way that supports a specific mindset. If possible, try and learn without bias toward one common way of thought.","It is a very useful class for the real world.","THIS CLASS IS HARD. Don't think that it's going to be easier just because it's economics. It's not easy! So prepare yourself for a hard time! But don't give up. The class is really useful, and most classes at Harvard aren't a walk in the park anyway.","if you have ec background, don't take it","Very average course","Despite falling a bit behind in the course there's a lot to learn from it and if you haven't taken AP Economics you should consider taking this course.","If you are 100% sure you want to do econ, then you should take this course.  However, the professor doesn't teach, TFs are variable, and there is little intimate guidance or feedback about tests or Psets.  It was a huge course.","It is a very difficult class and you must try to get ahead as fast as you can by reading ahead. You should also take all of the unit tests to get a further understanding.","It is a FANTASTIC class and everyone should take it!!","Stay ahead in the readings. Use the PSets to improve your understanding of the relevant concepts; that's what the PSets are for (duh).","If you have any interest in understanding economics, even on a basic level, this class will be very useful. My ability to understand current events (especially those concerning economics\/politics) greatly increased even after a few weeks in this course. How much you get out of the class will vary a lot, unfortunately, especially based on the TF you receive. Your TF will make or break the course.","It's a really great introductory course to microeconomics! I took AP Econ, but I would still recommend taking Ec10 because the class is really fun and there's still a lot to learn.","Ec10 is pretty straightforward and well taught. However, don't expect it to be a joke class. The problem sets and exams do require a fair amount of logic and thinking, and synthesizing across several units can be difficult. Keep up with the readings and do the problem sets thoroughly and you should be fine.","Read the book! Actually read it before section because then you will understand section and the problem sets soo much better!!!","This class is amazing it will change the way you think.","If you are interested in economics, this course is great!","The skills taught in this class are essential to every job in every industry, so this class should definitely be taken no matter what your interests are.","It teaches you basics that every adult should know and understand in the real world.","Solid class","learn the style of the class with the way questions on tests are different from questions on unit tests and psets.","Ec10 is an awesome introduction into economics.","You have no choice if you want to take more ec in the future...","It is often difficult to connect with professors, given that it is such a large class. If the student doesn't have an intrinsic interest in economics, the class is not made very interesting and doesn't try to make economics applicable to other fields.","If you're interested in economics, go ahead and try ec10. I am a sophomore science concentrator and just wanted to try the field to see if I liked it. \r\nThe problem sets are often challenging, but the midterms and final were very straightforward. I found the class to be very easy compared to others I have taken. This, however, does not prevent people from constantly complaining about it. \r\nDefinitely read the book (I didn't and did just fine, but its actually a very good textbook) and go to lecture (there are always question on the exam that you won't be able unless you went to lecture and paid attention). \r\nFinally, you simply must go to David Johnson's office hours. The man is an amazing teacher and a really cool guy. He was my favorite part of the class by far.","Definitely read the book. It will help you in the long run","Be aware of biases, and make sure you have a dedicated TF.","If you attend every lecture and section as well as do the readings and practice problems there is no reason you could not get an A.  The material is interesting and fun to work out problems.  I had no experinece with economics prior to taking the class, and as a bio major I had no trouble understanding the concepts and learning the material.  Anyone can take this class and learn a lot as well as do well.  One of my favorite courses at Harvard.","The class is structured very logically, though a lot depends on how good your TF is. The textbook tells you basically everything you need to know and the material is presented in a straightforward way.","It's a big class, which means it won't be personal and certainly won't be tailored to your learning style. Take it if you want a solid foundation in economics and learn well from a textbook.","Come on! Everyone should take that class, at least to assess it. Gives you great overview of economical terms and concepts. Granted, the material is very watered down but we all have to start somewhere.","David Johnson will make or break your experience in this course. He is excellent.","Take advantage of all of the resources offered to you.","Make sure to read the helpful hints and do all the practice tests online before exams.","No real connection with any professor. Exam expectations do not match up with what we do in class.","The experience of the class is completely dependent on which TF the student receives. The psets and exams demand much more than what is taught from section and the textbook. The economic information learned in this class does not justify taking it. The class is not worth the headache.","This class is taught predominately in section, so having a good section leader is imperative if you want to get the most out of Ec 10. Mankiw is absolutely brutal when he's on stage, and the guest lecturers (Except Roland Fryer) are just as dry. The class does give you a good overview of Economics as a whole, but only take it if you need it as a concentration requirement.","Not terribly difficult but a lot harder than you will expect.","This class is necessary for many students at Harvard for several fields of study. So, you have to do it. It's not the most intellectually stimulating class, and it can be very frustrating at points, but you do get a basic introduction to economics out of it, and it is a prerequisite.","This class is unnecessarily stressful and a hazard to your mental well-being. It is very poorly run and incredibly frustrating. You'd be better off taking an economics class at a community college. You'd probably learn more from it.","Let's face it, you're probably going to take it, along with everyone else...","Economics might sound boring but if you get the right tf it will be fun and not too hard.","Take it and go to office hours.","It's an intro to economics class! It's kind of like, you're gonna be sort of interested in this thing or not. It's not a ton of work and it's definitely not too difficult. I think it's probably just worth taking in like a \"I would like to be generally educated about how the world works\" kind of way.","I think economics is a really good thing to at least have some experience in but it definitely can be a really hard thing for some students. A lot of it is kind of conceptual.","How much you like this class really depends on your section leader because they do all of the teaching. Mankiw only does four lectures the entire semester. It is a great class to get you introduced into the world of economics even if you do not want to concentrate in it in the future.","This class is difficult and time consuming, but the subject is highly relevant and useful to know","I think that this is a valuable introductory course that is essential to an informed citizen's understanding of how our society functions, what motivates certain policies, and how to form an educated opinion on economic policy.","This class provides a wonderful introduction to economics.","It won't always be fun, but this class is worth taking.","You will love it if you are lucky to get a good TF.","Go to section or just read the textbook to do the psets. Do practice problems before your exams and you'll be fine. If you have questions, make sure to ask your TF. And go to DJ's office hours.","Take it.","Office hours helps clarify things! Often if you think that you already know something (the answer to a question on a problem set for example) going to office hours can help you add a new dimension to your response or can help you go above and beyond what the question is asking on the most basic level.","You'll be competing against students with ec backgrounds, even ones who got 5's on their AP exams. Not having an ec background means working hard to just stay in the middle of the pack, but this is definitely a great course to take for common knowledge even if not concentrating in ec.","You learn so much that if you get a bad grade in the course, you don't feel too bad.","This class is a requirement for many concentrations. It's not painful. If you put in time and effort, you will do (at the very least) relatively well.","This class is helpful for one's future in understanding the economy and how things work in the real world.","This is a solid course to introduce economics. I can see how it can be dull if one has already taken AP. As someone with no prior economics experience, I was definitely sufficiently challenged, more than I expected. Budget more time for this class than you think you need.","This class requires a lot of work, and many students take it, it moves through material quickly, but the lectures are interesting and applicable to every day life.","It requires some self-teaching and PSET's can be confusing and frustrating.","A manageable class-with potential to be quite interesting if you get into it.  Definitely go to David Johnson's office hours- he'll get you really excited about economics.  Problem sets are not too time consuming- especially if you work in a group.  Overall, a solid course- though your experience would depend on the quality of your TF.  Some lectures are not so great, some are awesome.","Your experience in in Ec10 will depend almost entirely on who your TF is. I was blessed with an excellent TF and therefore had an awesome time in the class. Make sure to do readings before class and you'll be fine and DO NOT FALL BEHIND. DO NOT.","You will feel like you learned a lot about how society operates after taking this course.","This class rally gives you all the tools necessary to analyze what is going on in the world.  It is so helpful to now possess this knowledge as I can now comfortably contribute to real world problems associated with economics.","It's hard as shit.","This is a course that I think everyone should consider taking, even if you're not considering Econ as a concentration. Though it can sometimes be pretty dry, it also provides you with knowledge about economics that every person should know. Be prepared for some long and pretty challenging p-sets!","Just take the course because if you have any interest in econ as a concentration or a secondary field than you need the class. If you just have a general interest in econ but don't want to pursue it as a concentration or secondary, you should still take the course because the interesting econ electives require ec10.","Very useful in understanding many aspects of the world around us. Very useful in everyday life.","While this class is definitely difficult, it does a good job teaching the basics of microeconomics. You are taught almost entirely in section, which means that your TF might as well be your Professor. Definitely go to office hours - both your TFs and Dr. Johnson's - because I don't know how I would have managed all my psets if I didn't go. The guest lectures are also a highlight, especially the ones by Dr. Cutler and Dr. Fryer.","Keep up with the reading. Go to office hours.","This class is a unique class. While the subject matter itself is very straightforward and rather common sense, it is taught in a way that makes it far more difficult than it should have to be. The textbook is a decent enough resource, but you may find it lacking in examples.","This is basically an easy high school class. If your TF is good though, he or she will cover the basics and you will learn plenty though.","It's a good class to take because economics is an important field to understand and is applicable to real life.","A Really solid course, but you must take a proactive stance in learning the material. Read the book ahead of time, pay attention in section, get started on your problem set early, seek office hour help if you have any questions because you will always get your question answered, and you should really not have any trouble in getting an A.","If you are interested in economics, or current events that are very related to economics,or some other related field for which economics is useful, then this course is fairly necessary and can definitely be interested. But you should not feel like you have to take it, even if you have other interests in the social sciences; it is more enjoyable if you actually are interested in engaging at some level with the material, rather than just doing it for the sake of doing it.","Ec10 really depends on your section leader and yourself. It is not a hard class, but you basically just have to read the book.","The course is taught really well, especially if you have a good section leader. I wouldn't take it if you don't have any interest in economics because the problem sets do require time and effort.","Teaching may not be perfect, but the subject material is great. The textbook is well written","if you don't know much about economics or quantitate analysis at all, don't fret. ec is accessible to anyone, thought challenging.","Incredibly difficult and really depends on what TF you receive","The true learning experience happens in David Johnson's office hours. Don't miss this opportunity.","It would depend on the person whether you like it a lot, but as long as you have general common sense, the subjects come easy","Do the problem sets well, read the book, and take the unit tests, and you'll be fine.  It's a huge, imperfect class and you'll find things to complain about, but you'll be fine.","Enroll in Matt Wyble's section!","I thought this class was hard. That's just me. Psets took up a lot of my time, and I mean they're probably not as time-consuming as math or science psets but I'm a prospective humanities major so cut me some slack. If you're a humanities major trying to fulfill the EMR requirement, take another course. One that isn't a full year course.","As long as you attend section and office hours you will be just fine! The material is really interesting and applicable to the real world.","This class is very manageable and you can learn a lot if you keep up with the work and pay attention in section.","I would tell future students that this is a good course regardless of what concentration that they are going to have. It teaches the basics, which are important to have\/understand in life.","This class is great if you want to determine whether or not to major in economics. For me, Ec10 was a good wake up call that I want nothing to do with the field.","take it pass fail!","go to lecture","You should be prepared for each section.","Do you really want to go into Econ?","Take the initiative to take your education into your own hands. Do not rely on section leaders to understand the section material. Read the textbook. Make sure you understand the textbook. I did so, and it has worked out for me. Although the course supports collaboration on problem sets, I would strongly encourage doing the problem sets on your own first, before seeking the help of your peers. This way, you are testing what YOU know, and what YOU are capable of, before learning more from your peers. The best way to prepare for exams is to do your own problem sets and your own reading from the very beginning.","It's a good introductory course to economics, but it's not particularly enjoyable unless you really are in love with economics. Your experience in the course varies on which section leader you get. Some are very good at teaching the course, and others aren't. It just depends if you get lucky or not. I'm glad that I took it though, because it gives you a basic understanding of economics and some government policies that are helpful for all people to know in general.","If you're not super comfortable with econ and if you don't have to take this course, I wouldn't recommend it. I found that section didn't teach me much beyond what I could have gotten from the textbook and that the psets became a major stressor in my life. The expectation was that you would go to office hours, but if you're taking other heavy courses, it's difficult to make this course the greatest priority with the time-requirement it necessitates. Maybe take it pass\/fail? Or if you're interested in the material, read the textbook and do a few of the problems here and there.","How good this course is is largely dependent on which TF you get. Reading the textbook is not as important as understanding the concepts thoroughly (by paying attention in section and taking notes) because you WILL be asked to apply them in contexts other than what the textbook presents. Rote memorization will not work in this course because the information is cumulative and the problems will involve knowing things from different units and then synthesizing that knowledge.","I took this course pass\/fail because I wanted to have an introduction in economics, a field in which I had never dabbled, but I did not want the pressure of the class on top of me. I fully recommend taking this course pass\/fail if you are able to still study and learn something while knowing you need not put as much time in to get an A. I got quite a bit out of this course.","This is a great class for getting right into the heart of basic microeconomics. It covers a lot of principles from AP Economics classes in high school as well as explore some other topics, and there are many great lecturers.","It was a really interesting class. Moderate in difficulty. Depends if you get a good section leader or not.","Do not take this class unless you plan to concentrate in Economics or have an interest in concentrating in Economics","Make sure you get a section leader that you understand and can learn from, because that can really make or break the class.","I had an extremely good experience with Ec10; the course material is interesting and important to know, and my section TF was amazing. However, it should be noted that this course is basically taught in section, so the quality of ones' TF basically determines how good or bad the course is.","Economics is important, very important. This is a terrible course. But it gets the job done, I guess.","If  you aren't into economics, this class is going to be super boring and inapplicable to you and your academic ambitions, which I guess is the point. They're looking to weed out people who take economics as an \"easy\" concentration. The work is not difficult, though it takes awhile since they don't teach a lot of the stuff for the p-set in sections. Be sure to talk to your TF as much as possible.","This class is very dependent on your TF. A good TF can make this class awesome, a bad one can make it very dependent on yourself. Personally, I didn't have a great TF, so I had to do a lot of self-taught learning. The material is really cool though - if you enjoy seeing relationships between different actions and their resultant outcome, you will enjoy this class.","The class is doable and you will get through it. Make the most of office hours and tutoring sessions. Work in small groups for pset. The class is an introductory course, it's undeniable that you wont be able to enjoy much individualized help and attention","You really cannot prepare for this course. Even with 5s in AP Macro and Micro, I still thought that this course was difficult.","If you have taken economics before, do not underestimate this course. The problem sets are challenging but also intriguing. Take advantage of all the aids (unit tests, helpful hints, office hours, etc.)! :)","you need to work really hard!","This class is disorganized and taught very poorly. It is very hard to learn how to do the problems in the book because it isn't taught in section or in the book. This class, in my opinion, made me dislike economics greatly.","The material that you learn in this class should be knowledge that everyone has. After all, Economics is so prominent.","You really have to actively keep up with the work and readings. if you don't put work in, the pests and tests will kill you.","It depends on how much Economics background you already have","Worst course I have taken in my life. Least interesting class ever.","Econ 10a is a well-structured class that will give you a firm understanding of introductory microeconomics. As long as you are willing to put in the time to read the textbook, make use of the helpful hints\/course materials posted online, and complete the problem sets thoroughly, the class will be very manageable and fair in its assessments. However, sections are definitely hit-or-miss: some section leaders will really help you understand the material, while others will basically add nothing.","This class is not easy, but the information you learn is very applicable to everyday life.","Your TF will determine your experience in Ec 10","Ec 10 is great, whether you are taking it for credit or just for the fun of learning economics. You learn so much about the field, I personally found answers to questions I had always pondered on for a long time. It is very applicable to real life phenomenon.","If you get a good TF then you should be fine","You need to put in work to understand the concepts, but David Johnson does a fabulous job of making the material accessible and relatable to students.","This is a great class to take at Harvard. It gives a great foundation of economics to students, and learning from Mankiw is always a delight. Section was also a great experience and very engaging. Great class overall.","This course is an utter drag. If your TF isn't very good, the class is miserable: boring, difficult, and irritating. Mankiw is extremely conservative and doesn't fairly represent liberal views, even though this is a foundation course. It's probably still a course worth taking, just to get a background in economics, but don't expect to enjoy it.","Go to the lectures and study along the semester, not just for exams.","I believe that every Harvard student should not graduate without having the knowledge of this class. The material taught is essential to know. I think the concepts we learn are very applicable to real world, and I think Mankiw's book does a great job establishing these concepts.\r\nThe class highly depends on the TF (your section leader), so keep your fingers crossed to get a good TF.","start your psets earlier","If you want to take the cool electives as an upperclassmen you need to take this course","Interesting material but could be more rigorous. Your experience depends on how good your Teaching Fellow is who vary a lot in their ability to \"teach\" .","This class has useful information, but the class will only be useful and\/or enjoyable if you have a good TF.  My TF was very nice, but could not explain anything in a way that helped me, someone who did not know anything about economics going into the class, understand the concepts.  This department is really big in general, and it was hard to get help.  Everything felt very impersonal, and it was hard to get someone to really sit down with me one-on-one to explain things.  The lectures were relevant, but not always the most interesting.  Overall, if one wants to learn some economics, take this class, but know that it's difficult to get help, and that you will learn mostly from reading the textbook on your own.  Also, if you don't like your TF, re-section right away.","Ec10 is a great class. You learn a lot about how the economy works, and on the problems sets there are a lot of supplemental readings about current news events that can be explained using some pretty simple ec10 concepts. Despite what you might hear, this is a course that is devoted to explaining positive rather than normative economic phenomena. Sections can be variable in their quality, but the problem sets and tests are fair and David Johnson is a great course head!","This course is a fun introduction to the field of economics and teaches knowledge and skills that every undergraduate should know to understand how the world works. No prior knowledge is required or assumed although many students have taken some economics before this course. I would highly recommend this class, as it provides extremely fundamental information that is useful to everyone. Through lectures, it also shows you interesting subfields of economics.","If you already have a basic background in economics and don't need to take Ec10 for any requirement, then don't take it. While the material is interesting and sometimes enlightening, it really matters which TF you get; Daniel McMann and David Johnson are great, and you should try to be in one of their sections. The section portion of the course is more important than lectures in consolidating the material on which you will be tested.","If you have any reservations about your TF after the first class come up with an excuse to switch out.","Ec 10 is a course that I believe that every student at Harvard should take, It is extremely relevant and applicable to life today and an understanding of economics and how markets work can be helpful for any field of study. This class is challenging and you will see things on exams that you have never seen before.","Get the textbook off reserve at Lamont, because it's really expensive, but also make sure you read it. This class is interesting, whether you want to major or minor in economics or not. Some TFs make section more interesting than others, but all are relatively good and guest lecturers are worth the listen.","Section is not that great","Great intro level course--don't be intimidated for any reason, even if you don't like economics.","this course sucks, but it is some sort of necessary evil. you need to take it for concentrating in economics, so you really have no option. just cross your fingers that you get a decent TF.","Its very hard almost impossible to get help if you need it. Claimed to have help if you needed, that was not the case","Good foundation for understanding the market","This is a great class and you'll learn a ton! Danny is an awesome TF!","This is a great course in learning how the work works in a very concentrated way.  In other words, learning about why people do things (incentives) is very important in understanding how businesses operate.","Understand that ec 10 is primarily taught in section and you have to be willing to take gamble of having a TF who is not a pro at explaining material that may be intuitive for them to others learning it for the first time","Take this course. It's important to understand free markets and capitalism.","No matter what you concentrate in, its important to have a basic understanding of economics so Ec10 is a great idea! Also, coursewide lectures bring in great speakers who are fun to hear!","This course provides a great basis of information about microeconomics and is especially good for someone with little to no background in economics who wants to see if they are interested in it.","Lectures are not beneficial at all (with a few exceptions: healthcare (cutler) and education (fryer)).  Not a difficult course at all, but keep up with the work.","Ec 10 is the basic groundwork for all other economics courses.  I've always believed economics not only to be the study of supply, demand, markets, what have you, but rather a study into how and why people think the way they do.  I think taking this class would help people build that framework in their mind, which would be useful for any discipline in the future.","This class is likely to frustrate you and make you question your intelligence. There is a great gap between what is taught in the classroom (concepts) and what is on the exams (problems with tricks). Understanding the concepts is not enough. If you want to succeed in this class, you will only do so by studying with practice tests.","It is a difficult class to keep up with. They never stay on one topic for an extended period of time, so if you miss it, its hard to go back and understand.","This is a reasonably challenging course with great content, a few interesting lectures, but a poorly organised and impersonal sectional teaching system. However in terms of learning the basics of economics, it does do a pretty great job.","I would say definitely take this course if you're considering exploring Econ, but this course wasn't as interesting as I hoped it would be. It's a solid intro class, but it did nothing to push me deeper into this field.","The class is difficult, but it really is one that everyone should take. Economics can be (and is!) really interesting, and the course is really good about connecting the material taught to real life. Just know that the way the class is handled is really poor, especially with the amount of people taking it. Nonetheless, definitely recommended - and shop around for a good section leader and change your section time if you need to, because it really is worth having a good section leader, as he or she will be the one teaching you.","This class requires a fair amount of work, but it's not too tough if you do all the readings and problem sets. It's interesting material and useful for real life too!","The course is excellent, and even if a you are assigned to a poor section leader, David Johnson is incredibly intelligent, enthusiastic and helpful when it comes to his office hours.","David Johnson is great. He writes relevant problem sets, unit tests, and exam problems. His review sessions are amazing, and he's very accessible outside class. This said, my TF (and I don't think I was particularly unlucky) was very poorly informed about not only some aspects of the content of the course but also its logistics. In several occasions they gave us wrong information (both in terms of contents and of logistics).","P-sets are time consuming and the class is overall a pain, but its still a worthwhile class if you're interested in economics.","The material covered in this course is fun! It's fascinating, it applies to prosaic and grand topics, and it's pretty simple to understand. It's important to try to get a TF you can work with - I made the mistake of sticking with one I couldn't understand and who left me with fewer notes than my friends in other sections. If you get a TF who isn't very helpful, as long as you review material on your own and take unit tests, you should be fine. The lectures were amazing. Homework was difficult, but it was great preparation for the tests.","This is a big class and the TF can make or break the class for you. However, most likely it is a requirement, so read the textbook. Many of the exam questions are taken directly from the textbook.","This is a well organised class from which you learn a lot. It is harder than the standard gen. ed. but is rewarding if you put in the effort. Some things could be improved, but as far as large intro. classes go, this one is pretty spot on.","It is a large intro class. I did not find it very exciting or motivating, but I learned a lot.","Ec10 is a useful course and the information can be applied in any field and every day life and interactions.","This is an excellent introduction to the field of Economics for those with no experience. Your experience in the class will likely depend on your section leader but you are free to attend other section leader's office hours for extra help if you need it.","Study the problem sets more than the books for midterms","David Johnson is a wonderful resource--get to know him! Also, if you are not satisfied with your TF, switch to another section. A good TF is important in this course. Do the psets yourself--you will learn a lot.","If you're actually interested in ec, take ec 1010. This was a bit of a waste of time.","It's a relatively difficult course. Even if you have taken AP micro, you learn more than you learned in high school, so I would recommend not skipping ec10.","its a class you kind of have to take because the knowledge is useful. its not terribly difficult, especially if you're an upperclassmen. just know lectures aren't meant to be incredibly useful.","It's a huge class with a lot of problems but a necessary evil for anyone who wants to take econ.","Ec 10 is no picnic, nor is it particularly inspirational, but its a useful-for-life class. Mankiw isn't around much, but David Johnson more than makes up for it! Your experience of the course will depend on your TF.","Lecture is worthless but many test multiple choice questions ask about details from lecture. Very few lecturers command attention.  Focus in section and it won't be that bad. If you are at all interested in taking economics as a concentration or a secondary, take Ec10. I wouldn't recommend it as a gen-ed or an elective however.","We all consume, different things in different quantities. Take this class for a different way of evaluating everyday decisions about what and how much you consume.","If your are not interested in concentrating economics it is still a good class to take in order to gain knowledge about the subject but it may prove difficult or uninteresting for a person not very passionate about economics.","Be prepared to do a lot of reading. DO THE READING BEFORE SECTION AND\/OR LECTURE. Come with a general understanding; this way when it is taught in section you get much more out of the lecture than you normally would. Ask questions in section, and get to know your TF really well. He\/she can be the deal breaker as to whether not you enjoy this course.\r\n\r\nExpect that the problem sets will also be rather lengthy. I would recommend working in groups, but splitting the work in a way that you still \"do\" all the problems.\r\n\r\nAlso, attend and listen to all lectures, even the ones that seem to be tangential to the course. They WILL appear in exams, and hey, they're interesting!","This class is what you make of it. The material itself is not too difficult, but its applications in problem sets can be a challenge. Take advantage of the head TFs office hours and the unit test program!","Absolutely take advantage of David Johnson's office hours. He's an incredible instructor and will probably change the way you look at issues across the board, regardless of your political inclinations. Different sections vary in quality, however the textbook, course isite, and David Johnson's office are certainly sufficient if you find that you're section doesn't bring you up to speed. All in all, this is a relevant course and is definitely worth taking if you've never taken a microeconomics class before.","This class can be a very high school type class.  The structure is section, readings and homework.","I took AP Economics in high school and found this course very easy. The only difference was that there were more math and the examples used actual numbers. It is taught completely in section, but I had a really good section leader who taught the material well. The problem sets are very straight forward","Make sure you connect with your section leader. Additionally, the unit tests are extremely helpful in mastering the material.","good class","If you know and understand basic economics, you should be set. If you don't, be prepared to struggle, since this class moves very fast through material and it is easy to get lost and left behind.","N\/A","good stuff to not but not easy","This class is definitely a good one to take; the knowledge that you learn is important to have in order to garner a basic understanding of how economies work. It's not too difficult but it definitely isn't a walk in the park. You need to put at least a few hours into problem sets each week that they're assigned and definitely need to put in time preparing for the semester exams. However, the expectations are reasonable; workloads and exam difficulties are fair.","It is great at applying to your everyday life","Yo, it's definitely eC 10","Take the class. It's not the best but it isn't the worst. It allows you to take further ec courses, concentrate, or secondary in the field. If you put in any effort, it will also make you well enough versed to hold a conversation and the journal. However, lecture can be dull and section leaders vary tremendously. If you can, try to find a good TF or switch into a section with a good one. If you actual do the reading and pay attention in section, the class will be not only manageable but easy. However, it is very easy to always be behind.","Get to know your section leader.","The textbook does not fit the coursework.","If you want to take econ, and you didn't take AP in high school, you're pretty much stuck with Ec 10. If you're not interested at all in concentrating but want to learn the subject, you're pretty much just better off buying Mankiw's textbook online and reading it yourself. Don't take this class as an elective or to fulfil Gen Eds. Only take it if you've no other way out.","This course is a great way to access the Economics department at Harvard. If you have other ambitions, it is a quintessential building block in understanding how our economy works.","This class is a good introductory class, though it is very large so it can feel very impersonal often","Take it only if you must. Otherwise it's just going to be quite disappointingly lackluster.","This is a great survey course for economics and any students interested in concentrating or minoring in the field should enroll.","As someone who has never done economics before, I enjoyed ec 10 because it really related to real life! I would recommend that everybody take an economics class at some point in their Harvard careers. It wasn't necessarily the best taught, but the concepts were very very interesting.","Do not shy away from this course if you haven't had previous econ experience.  It is a truly great class that teaches the basics of microecon-- principles that are useful for everyone to know, not only those who are looking to be economists.","Easy A if you do your homework and read the textbook.  Lectures are important to go to although some of them were dry, but overall an A+ course (though everything at Harvard gets an A+...)","I really enjoyed this course- the section, psets, lectures and tests all work together very nicely to increase problem solving skills and help you understand economics.","Go to unit tests.","Be sure to take advantage of all materials posted on the isite. It'll be expensive to print all of them, but it'll be well worth it when finals roll around and you have a binder with ever concept or detail on which you'll be tested. Although they may be boring, be sure to attend ALL of the lectures. More often than not a sizable chunk of a midterm will be dedicated not to the application of material presented int he lecture, but rather to the recollection of minute details (in addition to broader topics. Do (and pass) all of the unit tests.","It's Ec 10, the class title speaks for itself. It's something that almost everyone does here. It's a rewarding class, you learn a lot but make sure you go to all sections \/ lectures \/ read textbook! It's super important not to fall behind.","The problem sets will take longer than you think they will. Plan accordingly. Also, when taking tests, the most conservative answer is usually right, regardless of your personal political beliefs. Keep that in mind and you will do fine.","The psets are sometimes boring or time consuming, the TFs are not very good, but David Johnson (head TF) is amazing, so if you are interested in economics and if you go to his office hours you will be fine.","Having taken this class as a sophomore, I didn't feel the freshman stress surrounding the course. I felt more prepared with the pset and the overall stress of the course having had more experience taking Harvard classes. This course is a great life-course and I really suggest taking it if you haven't taken an econ course yet.","It's very possible to do well in Ec10 if you do the work requested of you carefully.  Don't fall behind on the reading, and start the pset as early as possible so that you have a chance to go to office hours if need be (and trust me, you'll have to go at some point).  David Johnson's are particularly helpful.","Ec 10 is...well, ec 10. It's required to do anything more in Econ, so you don't have a lot of choice. The material is interesting and some of the guest lectures (prof. Fryer's in particular) are really cool, but on the whole it doesn't always feel like the \"class\" is that helpful. It definitely teaches a lot, but you have to do a lot of learning on your own. David johnson is the highlight of the class.","This is a really great class; if you keep up with the reading, section will be more understandable and you will be more prepared for the problem sets and exams.","I had no economics experience entering this course. If you do not either and are wavering on whether or not to take this course, ask yourself two questions: 1) Am I willing to do the reading and complete the psets thoroughly? 2) Am I willing to take advantage of David Johnson's office hours? If you answered yes to both, then take this course as a self-directed individual determined to understand economics. Prepare to be amazed by how much you can learn from the course.","If you keep up with the problem sets and textbook readings, and do the optional unit tests, this course is completely feasible and very engaging. Go to lecture! The lectures talk about the applications of the problems you're doing with regard to public policy issues and are entirely interesting.","Since so many freshman take the course, you can always find people to study with. The textbook is also a great resource!","This class is a good intro course. I would however say if one has had AP Economics and feels comfortable with the subject to take an intermediate micro course. Ec. 10a. will be boring otherwise.","Ec10a is a thorough and interesting introduction to microeconomics. A lot depends on your section leader because most of the class is taught in sections-- and unfortunately, that is a matter of luck. There are a few things you can do to make this course easier for you, though: do the readings (Principles of Economics is a great textbook), go to David Johnson's office hours (whether or not you have questions about the psets) and review sessions and take notes during the lectures (a lot of them are boring; Mankiw is not a very good lecturer at all, but you're tested on the material in the exams). Overall it isn't a very hard course and there are a lot of opportunities to better your grade.","Learning the basics of economics is supremely helpful in helping you understand how the world around you works. Ec10 very thoroughly teaches you those foundations. The class itself isn't riveting, and learning the concepts can take some work (as with any class). However, it is very rewarding to be able to apply your analytical skills in problem sets and exams, not to mention when watching the news or reading the paper! Also, it is worth taking this class despite having taken HS economics. I myself aced HL IB Economics but found this class to be worthwhile and challenging, as it is much more thorough and somewhat more analytical.","Most people don't get excited about Ec10: it's notorious for being a standard freshman class that few people enjoy and most people fear for the work and exams. I didn't have this experience. In no way is the class exceptional. Sections aren't great, lectures are infrequent, and problem sets can be time consuming. However, it's a class worth taking simply because the material is interesting and a knowledge of it can benefit everyone. Most of the guest lecturers are outstanding and introduce you to different areas of the field of economics. It's a class worth taking - you might just like it!","David Johnson's Office Hours","Ec10 is useful, but not the most fun course out there.  This was my first experience with Economics, and while I liked the material there was something about the size and bureaucracy of the course that was a bit annoying - The tests are not really explained and there is too much lecture material on them considering how infrequent those lectures occur.  Nonetheless it is a very good course to learn about economics and the world.","This course is difficult but is interesting and manageable if you put the necessary effort into it.","Unless you work really hard of not at all, your grade will fall between 81 and 89. Also, don't expect to be able to do your PSets","Take this class if you have to, but it will not be enjoyable. Mankiw is never there, and do not expect your section leader to be good. What I do recommend, however, is to make full use of David Johnson's office hours and review sessions. Also, get a tutor. The problem sets are very difficult so don't put them off until the last minute.","It's a lot of hard work, but important concepts and very informative.","It's a very interesting course. As long as you keep up with the readings, it's pretty manageable. Not an easy course for a Gen Ed credit, but worth it if you find the material interesting.","This is a good course. The textbook is good, and that (in addition to lecture slides online) is all you need to really succeed in this course. The section component of the course was a lot of repetition from the textbook. I recommend this class. If you try hard on the readings and psets, you will do well. The curve on the exams are really friendly.","I wasn't a huge fan of ec 10, but there are reason to take it. First of all, it you take both semesters, you can get the US in the World gen ed covered. Also, while it was a bit boring, it's necessary in order to take more interesting econ classes.","Lots of fun.","Sections are not always very helpful, but in general I think it is an important class to take because it teaches us the basics of economics. David Johnson's office hours are particularly helpful for problem sets.","Definitely need to do the readings, go to lecture, and use the helpful hints. Also, do the psets in groups with people who will make sure you understand the material.","There is a slant in the materials, and at times the full picture is not presented, but overall it gives a very good basis for economics.","Ec10a is the basic intro economics class, so it isn't too hard or confusing. Just make sure to take the unit tests because they add points to your grade!","I highly recommend this class.  The material is interesting and challenging, but not unreasonable.","This class is a very good introduction to economics and I highly recommend the class if you'd like a good foundation in economics.  Even though at times the class seems as if you learn the most from the text book, the problem sets apply the information you've learned.","Take it for the sake of taking it if you've never had an ec course before. However, it's super boring and dry.","I think the class is far too large, and so the course is taught entirely by TFs who may or may not be effective at teaching you the material. In other classes, the TF\/sections are complementary to the material that is taught in lecture by a hired professor, however, in this class the opposite is true: the lectures are complementary to the material of the class which you learn in section. It's understandable because there are a lot of students taking the class, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a completely flawed system. It's luck of the draw with your TF, especially for those students who get the head TF, David Johnson, who is significantly better than every other TF. Take this class if economics interests you (or if you want to concentrate in it) because you will definitely learn basic economics, but don't just take it because so many other people take it.","Everyone should take Ec10 to get some sort of background on the way basic economics works. The exams are challenging but the lectures are interesting and fairly relevant to current events. The psets aren't too challenging and are only due once a week.","The quality of this class really depends on who your TF is.  I ended up with a perfectly nice but very unexciting TF who nearly put me to sleep every morning at 9am.  I heard other people talk about their enthusiastic, energetic TFs who made the course really fun to take.  It's basically luck of the draw.","Prepare to learn a lot about economics.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot of new concepts and can be very hit or miss in terms of interest level.","Take the problem sets seriously","If you want to take economics at Harvard, this is where you start, so as far as learning into economics goes, this course is very effective. However, all of the material that is the meat of the course will be taught by a TF, and the TFs vary significantly in teaching ability. Head Section Leader David Johnson is much more the face of this class than Mankiw, but Johnson is excellent.","Tough, but rewarding.","read the book and don't fall behind! go to david Johnson's office hours.","Do the readings, read the helpful hints, make sure you understand the PSETs, and GO TO DAVID JOHNSON OFFICE HOURS.","This class isn't particularly difficult, but it's also not particularly rewarding. Ec10 is about taking in information and producing it for the test. Take the class if you're interested in a basic introduction to a useful social science.","Everyone should take economics! That said, make sure that you get a good section leader. Also, do the reading!","I highly recommend utilizing your Office Hours as much as you can.","Ec 10 is the quintessential harvard course.","The class is hard, and a lot depends on the quality of your TF.  Fortunately, mine was good, but this is one of the first classes I've ever taken (I'm a freshman) where I can know all of the material and still do poorly on the exams.","If you have to take this class, then embrace it. It's basic material that everyone should know. No, it's not easy, It's a lot of work, it's difficult, and it's frustrating. But find a study group, STAY ON TOP OF THE WORK, make you sure you understand the concepts, and go to all office hours. You can definitely manage it and get through it.","Don't set your expectations too high\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you'll get the material, and that's it.","This is a horrible introduction to the Economics Department.  Everyone must do it, so it is very impersonalized and confusing.  Everything (including psets) is graded on a curve, so even though you may show that you understand the concept and get the \"right\" answer, you may not do as well as you thought you did.  Keep in mind that a lot of other people have economics experience, and so if you are taking this to LEARN something about economics, you may be initially at a disadvantage.  The fact that the course is entirely (yes entirely, dont fall for the BS) taught by your section leader, they can solely determine your experience in the course.  I had a horrible section leader, and so I actually somewhat dreaded going three times a week.  The bottom line is that if the course were more personalized, it would be a much better experience in terms of actually learning something about economics.","You have to be able to think about the problems on a whole new level than they are taught to you.","Economics 10 is a class worth taking. I believe a basic understanding in economics is vital for whatever you do. However, be forewarned this class can be killer. Work together with a group on problem sets, but ask questions!!! Figure out how to do the problems on your own and go to the unit tests. Take those a couple times that's how you learn. If you aren't invested in economics all the time you will get screwed just telling you how it is.","This class offers a good introduction and basic working knowledge of microeconomics. Your experience can honestly fluctuate based on who your section leader is. Mankiw has a  history of being a bland lecturer, but the professors brought in to lecture throughout the semester are all amazing and interesting themselves.","It's a challenging course, but if you do the readings and focus on the problem sets, it is manageable.","Your experience in Economics 10 is highly dependent on your Teaching Fellow. I lucked out with a good one, so my experience was positive. I learned so much in this class (probably 'cause I've never taken economics before). If you haven't taken it before, this a great class to take because it is so applicable and relevant to the real world and today's society. It's challenging, but not overwhelmingly difficult."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["with the right TF, this class is great!","It's a good class--much more public policy oriented than micro and without all the practical applications. It's kind of like an application of micro's thinking to the larger economy, which makes it useful for policy but less interesting and useful generally, in my opinion.","You will barely seen Mankiw, unless parents are there. How good your experience is depends on your TF.","You're section leader matters a lot, so if you do not have a good section leader go sit in on a friend's section instead. Also go to the big lectures, the speakers all have very interesting things to say about economics. This material is very applicable to the real world.","This course is really great even if you are not interested in concentrating in economics. I think that to be a model citizen it is important to have some knowledge of the economic system and this course gives you all of the information necessary to contribute to every day conversation about this topic.  Also, this course is really geared toward the student.  The professors and TFs are great about being around to answer questions and the course work is set up in a way that is user friendly for the students.","It's hard and very frustrating at times, but the information is very applicable.","This class can be frustrating because it presents economics as a science and presents only neoclassical models.  But it's a decent introduction to economics.","The material taught in macro very interesting because it applies to current events and daily life, but you will probably be frustrated studying for tests because they cover material outside of what was taught in section and the textbook.","So much in this course is dependent on who you get as your section TF.  If they are a good teacher, you will do well and it will be an extremely rewarding class.  If they are not, it will probably be a bad experience.","Great class! Teaches topics that makes you view the world differently. I highly recommend it even if you're not concentrating in economics!","intro econ is a class that has such foundational knowledge for understanding how the world works. learning about the financial systems that dominate our economy as well as the structure of a firm and its decision to produce or not is fascinating. BUT this class is a lot of work if you want to do really well. do the problem sets - don't just glide along within a group - READ the textbook and go to office hours.","As Ec10a this a solid introduction to economics. I would recommend to anyone because even you are definitely not going to concentrate in economics, learning about it is very helpful.","Understand that taking Ec10 means navigating the bureaucracy of the course, i.e. the possibility of having an inexperienced TF who doesn't effectively communicate material, potentially unprepared unit test graders, huge lectures, etc. The information learned, however, is interesting and can be applied across several fields of study \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is the joy of taking Ec10","This class was interesting at times, but it doesn't look very thoroughly at economics in the real world. Overall, I enjoyed the course, but I wish it had been more applicable at times.","Take this class if you want a basic foundation in macroeconomics. You definitely learn a lot in this class, and the best part about it is how applicable it is to the real world. There are six problem sets throughout the semester that usually take about four hours to do. They're of varying lengths and difficulties, though, and some can take a lot of time and be really challenging. The first semester exam was pretty difficult, the second was easier, and the final was very difficult. If you put in the necessary time for this class, though, you'll get through it and be fine.","Stay on top of reading and take unit tests.","Take this class if you are interested in learning the basics of macroeconomics, and I would recommend this course to someone who isn't thinking of concentrating in Ec, but would like to gain some of the real word value associated with knowledge of the financial markets.","If you are interested in economics and have not been formally exposed to it before -- or if you are interested in other social sciences -- you have something of a civic duty to take this or an equivalent course. Your enjoyment will depend on your TF, but the lectures and subject-matter are highly informative and deal with very important public policy issues.","It is a solid class, you will probably have to teach yourself a lot of the information however it is not too dense.","Read the textbook and take notes while you read. Definitely go take the unit tests.","I took this class as a gen ed because I wanted to take something different. It was definitely not an easy gen ed, but I found it really interesting.","Ec10b is the best course I've taken at Harvard so far. The class will greatly improve your understanding of the world. It will change how you analyze political issues and probably also expose you to the idea of the importance of compounding interest (which will make you a better investor in the future). David Johnson, the TF's, and Professor Mankiw all really push the students to try to get the students to apply the material to the real world. I think that they were successful and I can honestly say that now when I read the newspaper I'm able to understand much more.","It's a challenge but it's worth it in the end","Go to office hours (especially David Johnson's and Steve White's)","stay on top of studying... don't let those exams sneak up on you","David Johnson structured the course very well. Mankiw... I don't know much about what he does for ec10.","Don't take it for fun. It's tough and I'm only doing it because it's for my concentration.","This course really \"gives you a seat at the table\" as David Johnson would say.  What you learn in this course about long run and short run fluctuations can help you to understand news reports and other talks about the current state of the US economy. The questions can be difficult to interpret on exams, but if you try hard to learn as much as you can and take advantage of all of the help that is offered (go to DJ's office hours!), this class will be worth it.","Great Class","It's great, if you keep an open mind.","Ec10 provides a great introduction to Economics. In one year, you learn the basics of economics\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou're taught the academic models, historical examples that relate, and a new way of thinking. Additionally, the small sections allow you to meet a bunch of students which is great as a Freshman.","The particular TF you get plays a big role in enjoyment of this course and can make material simple or difficult to understand.","There is a lot of work","Practice\/review (psets, helpful hints, old practice exams) is the key to excelling in this class.","Use the \"helpful hints.\"","If there were a better introduction to economics, I would offer you take that, but there really isn't.","Do not take the second semester of economics unless you are actually interested. It is okay to drop it.","Ec10 is an introductory class, nothing more. You don't really learn too many applicable things.","Ec10 is certainly an experience. The highlight will probably be David Johnson. The grading is confusing, the textbook is unwieldy, but it's worth taking if you want to understand the basics of economics. Furthermore, some of the guest lecturers are pretty phenomenal. Even if you don't take Ec10, I would advise sneaking into Sanders for some of them!","Ec10 is a great course to take because it provides a really interesting introduction to economic thought (whether you plan on concentrating in Ec or are just interested in the topic). It requires a lot of time to do well and understand the material, but is worth it.","Ec10 is not one of those classes that you will remember for the rest of your life as the best part of your undergrad career. Instead, you will take it since it is necessary, and every contributing member of society should have a basic understanding of economics. So go grab 700 of your closest friends and get ready to learn about supply and demand.","Ec 10 is definitely an experience. Having taken it as a sophomore, you'll probably get more enjoyment if you take it as a freshman, but it's still a decent class. Knowledge of economics does make you feel like you know what's going on in the world. Take all the unit tests because they help with your understanding and your grade.","It's a large class but doesn't feel like it. If you put the effort in, you get a lot out.","A solid class","This is so well run.  There are a huge amount of resources available to help students - unit tests, problem sets really foster deep comprehension, office hours, online supplements... If you do poorly in this class it's because you're not taking advantage of all the available resources.","you need it and what you learn is useful. given that, it sucked. i hated it.","The material is very rewarding and will open your perspective!","Go to the lectures. Even though most are not heavily tested, some are extremely interesting and can inspire you.","Ec 10b is a great class, just stay on top of the work and it is really rewarding.","Ec 10b provides a very thorough introduction to macroeconomics, and you leave the class with enough skills and knowledge to analyze economic scenarios that you might find in the newspaper, for instance. Even if you have taken an introductory economics course before, Ec 10b will help you consolidate and piece together concepts, showing how they fit and work together.","Take it!","While this class wasn't very engaging, it's necessary to take if you want to do anything with economics at school and definitely covers a lot of material in macroeconomics. Since the class is taught mostly in section, a lot of your experience in the class depends on the section leader. I had a great TF who was really good at teaching the information, but I know friends who had worse experiences. It is cool taking a class that so many other freshman take, because it's so easy to find people to work or study with.","You might love it, you might hate it. The point is, this information is important to know for anyone in any field. It's challenging, but you will leave this class with a lot of great knowledge. I would recommend this class for every Harvard student.","It's a nice introduction to economics course. It helps you understand the workings of the economy which everyone should know. As long as you read and pay attention in section, the class shouldn't be too hard.","This class goes well with ec10a to give a good overview of basic economics, and is helpful in determining if you want to pursue further studies of economics.","The problem sets took a very long time. While the subject matter is interesting, your experience of the course will depend greatly on the section leader you are assigned to and the enthusiasm of said section leader. Some prepare awesome review packets while some are fairly uninteresting and don't do much to make the course discussions lively. Knowledge of the assumptions of modern classical economics is vital, but any intro economics course is likely doomed to be at least moderately boring. Take it, but don't expect to be blown away by exciting economic theory. Getting a lot from Ec 10 requires a lot of self-motivation, and as a non-concentrator I found it hard to muster motivation for 10b, especially with the last problem set.","The material learned in this class is invaluable. Go to David Johnson's office hours","It's Ec 10. You probably have to take it--I wouldn't take it if you don't.","The normativity embedded within the way they teach this course can be annoying if you take the course too seriously. You'll probably get the most out of this course if you keep a somewhat critical eye on what it's teaching you, even though the assessments encourage you more to simply regurgitate. It gets more interesting towards the end though, and really isn't too much work - you can get by in the course by drawing any graphs they teach you with your mind mostly on other things.","Literally everyone at Harvard should take this class. It gives you a great understanding of the world.","If you want to concentrate or secondary in ec, you have to take this unless you skip to a higher level ec like 1010 or 1011. If you've never taken ec then you can't get out of this. Do the textbook readings and the psets! And go to DJ office hours!!","The grade you get in the class is a direct result of the amount you put in. GO TO OFFICE HOURS.","If you want to learn macroeconomics and are new to the subject, this is the course to take. It covers so much and really gives you a strong economic foundation and a relevant understanding of what is going on in the world.","Good course, great material. Section determines experience in the course.","Don't let lectures discourage you... actually pay attention, you will be tested on that information.","This class was great. If you didn't like Microeconomics (Ec10a) during the first semester, I would highly recommend sticking it out and taking Ec10b. I loved the second semester of Ec10 because the concepts we discussed are easily applicable to every day life.","A knowledge of Economics is essential, no matter what you end up doing. Although not everyone has a great experience jn the class, you truly do learn \r\nA LOT.","this class is very good to see if you want to further pursue economics","TAKE IT and you will understand a lot more about how the world works.","The course gives a good basis in macroeconomics, an important field to understand in both your career and in life.","it's a must","Its a great course","It was great. Learned a lot about the way the economy works, and have such a larger understanding now.","Do all of the assignments and synthesize","I loved Ec 10! I learned so so much in this class, especially the macro component, that enables me to better understand current events and how the world works on a really fundamental level. The material was challenging but ultimately manageable if you do all the work and take advantage of the resources David Johnson and the course provide. Make sure to seek out help if you need it at office hours--there are such high returns on working to really understand the material, and I found it incredibly interesting. Also, some of the foremost economic minds in the world come speak to this class, which is a really cool experience.","This is a very efficiently organized course! I came out of this course with a deeper economic knowledge than I had expected, and the constant emphasis on real-world applications was incredible.","It changed the way I look at the world and politics.","A great introduction to Economics.","DJ's synthesis of the material really is incredible, and if you put in the work to understand what the course is trying to teach you, the practical knowledge and general understanding of the economy you'll gain is truly incredible.","This course is a great course to learn general information about the economy. Even if you are not concentrating in Economics, it is useful information to learn.","It is a tough course at times, but taking it gives you a good base to understand how economies work. It was much more interesting than microeconomics and dealt with issues that were more relevant. Take it if you would like you get a good sense of how economies operate.","It is a great class. Go to DJs OH - he kills it in class.","It is a rough ride because it demands a lot of not-quite-fulfilling work, but it is a useful introduction to Econ.","At times, the material is much more challenging than macro, but if you try to really understand the reason behind certain shifts or events, everything begins to become very intuitive. A lot of your understanding is dependent on which TF you have, as usual.","This class is worthwhile- it provides you with a solid understanding of macroeconomic mechanisms that enables you to understand and question the reasoning behind policy decisions. The assignments are fair but can be deceivingly tricky- be sure to keep up in the textbook as it does a great job explaining basically everything you need to know.","The subject material is great! It can be challenging, but as long as you stay up to date on readings\/PSETS\/etc., you will learn a lot and do well.","Ec10b is naturally very similar to Ec10a in structure. Your experience is probably really dependent on your TF. I had a great TF, and I had a very good experience in Ec10b. However, the lectures tend to be boring, and a lot of people end up dozing off or not even showing up as a result. The exams were harder this semester, and the concepts were perhaps slightly more difficult to grasp, in my opinion. The main difference is that Ec10b relies a little more on section material than Ec10a, meaning studying the book is not as effective for Ec10b. As long as you understand the problem sets, the book, and do the exam review materials, you should be fine. Also, make sure you take the Unit Tests!","This class is tough but it is really interesting and has a lot of real-world applications. It is MUCH better than ec 10a.","This class is good for learning macroeconomics","It honestly really depends on your preference of macro and micro, but I thought that the concepts we learned in macro were much more applicable to the real word and if you are like me, having never had any prior experience in economics, this is a great introduction.","This. Class. Sucked. So. Much. I cried. I almost quit. But I'm not going to let Ec10 win. So I manned up and I finished! I am so not concentrating in Economics. This class was soo bad. Why can't Harvard just have a Business major?!","It is a great introduction to economics, although it focuses heavily on the US economy.","Some people love macro, others love micro. Overall, it's Ec10. Nothing to get excited about, but there can be moments that surprise you. Just pray for a good TF and go to David Johnson's review sessions.","NA","Except a reasonable amount of work, but work that is manageable and interesting.","This course depends almost entirely on how good your TF is. Good TF = Great experience. Bad TF = Horrendous experience. Get a good idea what your TF is like, and if they aren't going to be good, try to switch sections. I won the TF lottery and had Steve White. He is unbelievably dedicated and a fantastic guy. I'm planning on concentrating in Ec because of his teaching. Get him if you can.","It is annoying, but you have to get through it, and it will help you understand the economy better.","As a prospective business\/ finance person I found EC10b to be much more applicable to the real world and what I may encounter in the future. It often overlapped with business comps I did as similar ideas were introduced with the bond market. If you are not sure whether to take b after a, I suggest you do.","It sucks, but its something you have to do. Try to make the best of it by working with someone from your section on the PSets","Ec 10 is a decent introduction to economics.  The section component is beneficial, but don't get excited for Mankiw's lectures (they're boring and will put you to sleep).  Problem sets are manageable (only 6 a semester). You will probably find yourself questioning why you got so many points off on tests, though, because your graded tests will come back with no explanation as to why you were penalized. Overall a decent course - don't take it for a Gen Ed, but if you need it for a Concentration\/Secondary, it's a necessary evil.","I'd tell them that they should take AP Econ in high school so that they don't have to take the Ec 10 series at Harvard. There are much better classes to take than this one.","It can be a pain, but I'm very glad I stuck with it.","Ec 10b is a good course and explains many of the Macroeconomic concepts that one runs into in the news and current events.","The class has everything going for it except the class itself","Ec 10b is much better than Ec 10a. You learn a lot more about business and international business. The material is more interesting as well.","I took pass\/fail just to get a solid background in macroeconomics and it was definitely worth it. Section is very helpful, lecture not so much.","Ec 10 is a great intro class that everyone in the college should take to give you a basic understanding of the economic reasoning that people exhibit.","Though it will give you a basic understanding of economics which is useful to everyone, the class is not very well taught and a lot of your knowledge amassed will be from your own work and reading the textbook.","If I could go back in time and brainwash myself into making a different choice I would. \r\nYou want to learn economics? Buy a different textbook and read it or take a summer class at a community college, but you're not going to get a solid introduction to economics in this class.","It is useful if you are planning on concentrating in economics, but it feels like a mass produced course and is not individualized","The class is not fun and hard to do well in because the book doesn't prepare you for exams.","Good way to find out if you want to study economics","Ec10 was by far the most practical and perhaps the most important course I have taken at Harvard thus far. Macroeconomics, even at this basic level, really helped me approach the rest of my coursework (and understanding of current events) in a significant way.","Make sure to do all the work and do the unit tests.","A great intro Ec class.  Be interested about the field of economics before you take it, though because, it is intense","Definitely attend section, do the readings, and the psets.","It's a very different class than micro and is much easier to understand.","If you are a mathematically inclined person, take a look at 1010b or 1011b before taking 10b. If I could go back in time, I would not have taken this class.","Micro and macroeconomics is crucial for understanding how societies work, so everyone would benefit out of this class.","Seek out David Johnson for help and enthusiasm, and be wary of the quality of your TF - if she\/he is not well versed, you might have to devote much time at office hours and rereading parts of the textbook.","The information is applicable and essential background knowledge, but the course itself is not the most well taught.","Take it!","If you take Ec 10, do whatever you can to get into Steve White's section. He is incredible! Even if you don't get lucky enough to be in his section, he has a great, very useful website. He makes the course very accessible to everyone. David Johnson, too, is a very useful resource. Go to his office hours!","This class is challenging. I found it more difficult than Ec 10a, but that doesn't seem to be the norm. I don't know what the quality of the class will be now that David Johnson is leaving.","Take this course. Don't listen to the negative reviews. The content of this course is something every citizen needs to know, certainly every Harvard student.","This course is a necessary prerequisite not just in terms of department requirements but in terms of understanding how the economy works.","you have to have an interest in the subject before you take the class because otherwise you're going to be miserable doing the work.","Take it. It's ec10.","It's not the most fun class, but you do learn a good amount about economics, and it's not too hard. I think it's just something that's important for people to know.","This is not a good class. Ec10b was better than Ec10a, but that's more of a personal opinion of the subject matter. Both of the classes suffer from the same problem: the very structure of the class is flawed. Almost every other class is based on its lectures or full class meetings, and the section is there to complement the material learned in class. This way, if you have a poor TF, you're still able to be successful in the class. In Ec10, the entire class is built around your sections. If you get unlucky with your TF or if you get really lucky and get the head TF (David Johnson) then it greatly affects your experience in the class. Leaving this much up to TFs, and not to the tenured professors whom we've entrusted to teach undergrads, is the main problem with this class.","I truly enjoyed this class and thought that it was wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in economics. Make sure that you keep up to date with the readings both from the textbook and online. The section leaders are amazing, there are wonderful resources, and you truly learn a lot.","The Ec10 sequence is a very good intro class if you want to major or secondary or even just know some economics. The material is very interesting and useful.","Don't be afraid to switch TFs if you feel its necessary. However, you won't know how another TF teaches unless you go to their office hours or attend one of their sections. As hard as it is, start your problem sets earlier than later (at least understand the questions by Wednesdays) so you can go to office hours and work it out there. Don't take short cuts with problem sets by having others in your collab group do all the work! Make sure you are understanding by working through problem sets.","Despite its problems, this class is worth taking, simply because the basic knowledge of economic structures are hugely important to an understanding of our our world economic system works.  That knowledge can lead to so many other fields, which is why I would recommend this class despite its flaws.","It is very valuable to learn more about how the economy works. That being said, this course is not easy and requires a lot of time, which should be considered when constructing a semester schedule.","A bit boring but necessary stuff","Ec10b is a class that teaches you basic knowledge about how the world works. It gives you a lot of useful information that you'll need in life.","Take the unit tests! Not only can they help your grade, but they also are great reviews of the material and helped me do the problem sets and take the exams.","Generally, the material is more rewarding than 10a's.","Ec10b is pretty different from Ec10a--less math, more conceptual. It's an interesting course, I enjoyed the lectures from 10b more than 10a. I think you learn more about things that you didn't know before, 10a was sort of common sense.","Take this class, but be prepared to maybe not understand everything.","I would definitely take this class. It was much easier than I expected it to be (I had no Econ background) and I think everyone should take an Econ course at some point. Make sure you get a good tf, because it is taught almost completely in section, but if you have a good tf, you should enjoy this class!","you should definitely take this class even if taken pass fail-- very important to know these concepts in general","Work hard, go to office hours","If you are a math oriented student and have the ability to place out of this course, definitely take the 1010b or 1011b, as the fear of using math in this course makes the material seem unnecessarily confusing. Everything taught is too general and the section component does not prepare you whatsoever for the exams.","The class is annoyingly difficult and time-consuming, but obviously a worthy class of taking and one that most people should take. Besides, nothing I write here is going to persuade or dissuade someone from taking it.","good luck","You should take this.","If you put in the work on the problem sets and read the textbook, this class shouldn't be an issue. The questions on exams are straightforward and section presents everything in an easy to understand format. Finished the class with a much greater understanding of macroeconomics, especially the economic system in the US and financial current events.","This course is a must take.  Not because its the greatest class ever but because its useful material. Just take it.","no one cares about you since there's a ton of people, but if you invest yourself in it you learn a lot","Interesting subject; important to learn","This class basically allows you to understand how the world really works...you can read the WSJ without questions\/confusion.","Take this course 100%. Read the helpful hints, listen in section, and the class will be a great experience for you!","Everyone should take this class at some point in their Harvard career. So many people take it, it feels like a rite of passage.","This course can be dry at times, but if you like government and policy, you will definitely enjoy it.","Ec10b is pretty much what you will expect from Ec10a.","This class is a good introduction to macroeconomics, but be wary about the size of the class, since it will definitely lead to minimal interaction with the professors and feeling like you're just one in hundreds of students.","Teaching 600 students isn't easy, and in ec10 it shows. However, a working knowledge of macroeconomics is almost essential for anyone other than hardcore science or fine arts concentrators. That working knowledge it does give you, through a good textbook and challenging yet educational P-sets.","Listen and engage do outside studying","Good class but lectures are useless.","I think it is important to understand what is going on in the economy but the section component is  redundant and boring and does not prepare you for PSETS or the exam.","This class is too much to a machine.  The pset and test questions are too wordy\/ convoluted and if you are not in David Johnson's section, you will have no idea what is going on.","The macroeconomics half of Ec10 is interesting and relevant to the real world. Problem sets are challenging and should be started early in the week. Go to office hours.","You should only take this class if you 1) know you are going to concentrate in economics, or 2) if you have a strong desire to learn foundational economics. Otherwise, the course will be a drag and it's just a very annoying bureaucratic course in which you have to jump through a lot of hoops (weekly problem sets, biweekly unit tests, sections, lectures, midterms) in order to do well on everything. Ec10 was one of my least favorite classes this year, not necessarily because the material was boring (because sometimes it can be interesting and thought-provoking) but because the class was taught poorly, at least in section. You will learn a lot, just not in section. Your section leader will probably make or break the class for you, so switch TFs for 10b if you didn't like your 10a TF's teaching style. Also do the unit tests and pass them because no matter how annoying they can be, they do help you in the long run. I wasn't particularly thrilled about Ec, but then again, some people really enjoyed it. It all depends on you and your interests.","It is a great course that everyone should take to prepare themselves for life.","Ec 10 is a good introductory course, but keep in mind that it's designed to weed out people who aren't serious about economics. It's not difficult, but it does require a fair amount of extrapolation. You have to understand and apply the textbook's economic concepts in a more complex way than you're taught in section; just memorizing them as taught isn't sufficient. A good class though!","It's not very entertaining, but it is well taught and you learn a lot.","Very good introduction to basic concepts of economics! A MUST TAKE before graduation if you nothing about economics","More of Ec 10a, you kind of know whether or not you want to\/need to take this course. A lot comes down to having a good section leader. Very different focus and type of thinking needed though compared to micro. Less math, which may make it easier or harder. Guest lectures I found slightly less interesting.","Great into level macroeconomics course that does not move too fast and is easily understandable even for someone with no economics (besides microecon (Ec10a)) background.","As a foundational course, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to start studying economics (a requirement). However, I would not recommend this to someone simply looking to satisfy a GenEd.","The class can be made as easy or as hard as you want it to be depending on how much work you are willing to do. If you do the readings, take the unit tests, and see your TFs when you have questions, it can be a very rewarding and manageable class.","It's worth the work. You learn a ton and become informed about important issues that many americans and many of our peers--even those at Harvard--are ignorant of","Ec10b is much, much better than Ec10a. The material is much more interesting, the problem sets are easier, and it is all around much more relevant. Take it, even if you hated\/struggled through Ec10a! But, keep in mind that this is still Ec10 and can only be so great.","Ec10b is just like Ec10a... It teaches you valuable information, but does it in a relatively boring, uninviting manner. The Ec department could really spend some time revamping the course. Maybe make it more welcoming like CS50?","You have to take it but it's poorly taught. You'll have a good experience if you get a good TF but it's kind of a crapshoot.","This was my favorite course by far. If you are considering economics, business, history, social studies, government, anything really in the social studies and humanities area you should definitely be taking this class (ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE THINK OF DOING GOVERNMENT). I feel like my perspective on the world has been greatly enlarged and I feel much more confident debating and speaking on public affairs and current events. Ec10 is a must however much of your success, unfortunately, is based on the strength of your teaching fellow (something I NEVER say). Also, know that the material in the book is not all that you will need to understand the material and be able to put them into practice for the test. Many equations and rules needed are in section, not the text, and some even required a little bit of outside research (Investopedia is a great resource for very basic Economics inquiries).","The people who end up concentrating in econ do it in spite of, not because of this course. Be sure to get a decent TF, of which there are few. This is important since a large part of the course is taught in section and is not at all based on the textbook or online postings. Speaking of which, don't buy the textbook - it's pretty useless.","Definitely take this course even if you don't want to do economics in the future. This course helps you understand real world events and policies much better and is not a time killer with the weekly pset. I feel much more informed about the reasoning behind economic policy. It's hard to find courses like this that are immediately applicable to recent events and to reality.","Is more difficult than you would imagine!","This class is very useful for understanding the real world and how it works.","Section was strong. The high correlation between the textbook and the course was also a plus. I liked the application to real world examples with the guest lectures and unit tests were also helpful.","It was hard, but doable.","It is sooooo hard","The quality of the course is highly dependent on which TF you get. \r\n\r\nThe Mankiw text is not very engaging and not at all helpful in the course. \r\n\r\nDavid Johnson's materials are the most important, and they are the most informative.","A better class than it gets credit for, but if you're a competent person you should strongly consider taking Ec1010. This class definitely aims for the lowest common denominator at times.","David Johnson is the world's best TF so pray you get him, the class is better than Ec10a and more real world","Ec 10b isn't much better than Ec 10a. If you weren't a fan of Ec 10a, you're probably not going to enjoy this course either. Everything is presented a bit vaguely and there are definitely disparities in terms of what each section teaches. That being said, everything relates to current events, so that's a plus. I'm an Ec concentrator, so of course I have to take this course. It's pretty much your standard \"Intro to Macroeconomics\" course with a bit of a kick. Most things are straight forward, with the exception of a few concepts. Definitely recommended for those who are interested in having a basic understanding of how the economy functions and want to learn more about past and current economic conditions.","This course is as time-consuming\/difficult as you make it. If you decide you want to understand all the introductory level concepts at a more subtle and exact level, then you will need to consult supplementary materials, vivisect concepts, ask David questions, and likely become more confused. And he will probably say that you're \"overthinking.\" But he's wrong because it's impossible to overthink something that is too simplistic to start with. This initial stage of confusion is when you realize that you indeed \"know nothing,\" in Socrates words. Yet hope lies in persistence. The stage of overthinking is, in fact, not after you have understood the material, but after you have understood it at a very elementary and superficial level. Overthinking is that magical moment when you see the actual chaos beneath all the simplified material presented. You must think further and harder to resolve chaos into order--at long last. As Aeschylus said, pathei mathos. Even though you could merely learn the oversimplified concepts and ace the test (because you won't be confused by exposure to higher matter) and spend about a quarter of the time you would otherwise devote to a more rigorous pursuit of truth. But what is life if not the pursuit of truth? Will you commit, in Camus' words, \"philosophical suicide\"?","No matter what your major will be, Economics is a staple of life and so everyone should take this class","It is a class that is taken by so many people who think that they want to concentrate in Ec, but so many people struggle in this class that many of them drop the idea.","Fall semester sucks, but stick around for spring. It gets better","Don't take this unless you're genuinely, passionately interested in the economy and US history.","It's Ec10, you have to take it basically, and it's going to be rough, but macro is kind of interesting.","Synthesis is everything! Attend your section and do all of the unit tests.","Great and necessary information to know about how the world works; not too difficult and easy to excel in if effort is there.","Take it for the sake of learning economics. There's nothing really special about the course, but I'd say take it just to learn economics if you've never had a class in it before.","This course is excellent if you want to understand how our economy works. If you have never taken economics before, this is knowledge you want to have regardless of your major or career plans. Like many large courses, to do well you must make sure you are keeping up with the material. No one will necessarily notice if you are not until the exams, especially because problem sets are usually done in groups. Problem sets are very infrequent during certain parts of the semester, but material is still being covered fairly quickly. Always read the helpful hints!!","This course is really hard, but if you stay on top of the readings and assignments you will be okay. It's really important to do the problem sets as far in advance as possible, so that you can go to office hours and really work on understanding the concepts.","If you're an economics concentrator, you probably are going to take this class. Your section experience really depends on what kind of TF you get. The lecture experience was also definitely varied. Definitely don't miss out on taking unit tests -- they are really good preparation material for the big tests, and help your grade out a lot. Don't be afraid of going to your TF's office hours -- they'll really appreciate it!","It is difficult but you get out what you put in. You learn a lot.","Ec 10 is relevant to a lot of fields and your personal future life so I would definitely tell people to take it.","Stay on top of your reading! It's easy to get behind!","Ec10 is fantastic in terms of material covered. It's a lot of material but it is very useful material and the teaching is wonderful. It will require a lot more time than a general intro class but the more time you put on it, the better. Most people take it because they are required to, and I believe everybody should be required to take this class!!","don't take aubrey clark's section.","Good to take because economics is important to understand for life. Freshman year it works because everyone else takes it, moderate difficulty and medium workload.","Take this course. The class gives you an overview of the field of economics and will make you a more interesting, thoughtful, and well rounded person. If you are freshman, definitely take it. If you are upperclassmen, only take it if you are willing to stay engaged - otherwise your grades will suffer. This class opens doors.","Be prepared for the midterms","Do it if you want to learn more about econ theory in general","Definitely a necessary and useful class. Room for improvement, but still helps understand a lot.","Although the material and psets can be a bit difficult, I learned so much from this class. Macro is  very relatable to real life, and I feel that I have a much better understanding of what is going on in the world today. When I hear about the Fed in the news, I actually know what that means now. This class has also made me more aware of overall issues in the economy as we continue to recover from the crisis. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to better understand what is actually going on in the world. Also, the TFs are amazing!","The course is poorly taught and poorly run, but probably essential if you have any interest in the social sciences and\/or economics. Don't take for Gen Ed.","Run as efficiently as a machine","This course is great, especially Ec10b. It does take a lot of effort in order to truly feel like you're learning, so take that into account.","This class gives you crucial information that makes you a much more informed individual when you are reading the news or pursuing other academic endeavors at Harvard.   That said, it depends a lot on your TF whether or not you will enjoy the course.","Though an annoying and sometimes exhausting class, I learned an incredible amount of Ec 10 and would recommend it to anyone who feels ignorant on the subject.","You will get a lot out of this class if it is your priority. If you put in the time to actually do out all of the psets, and in addition take the unit tests, you will do great on the exams. Make sure to attend David Johnson's OH that are open to all students since he tends to synthesize the material well, and will most likely hint at the most important questions on a pset that will later be tested.","Interesting material; however, the experience you have definitely depends on how good your section leader is. It's a luck-of-the-draw situation.","This class isn't very engaging so make sure you really like economics before taking it.  Also consider ec 1010.  THey try to make the class easier by distilling stuff down to the point that by \"simplifying\" the material it makes it more complicated understanding how everything is related.","Not only for concentration, but this course is a course everyone should take to understand how the world works.","Your learning experience is dependent on who you get as a TF. If you are unsatisfied, ask to move.","It's a hard class but it teaches you about a lot of topics that you really should know about. I think it should be highly recommended to freshman because I really wish that I had thought more about taking it last year rather than sophomore year.","As long as you read the book or go to section and can synthesize what's being said, you will be fine.","Much better than Ec10a. You learn so much about Economic Policy and real applications.","Ec10b provides a good introduction to macroeconomics. David Johnson is great, but most of the other teaching fellows are not. My teaching fellow was clearly not qualified. If you can, take 1010b instead.","It is a very good but tough class.","Make sure to go to office hours!","I enjoyed it because it was very relevant to the real world economy today, but I also had a great TF, so the course really depends on that. The midterms are ok and the final was ok, but it helps to go to office hours and really understand the broad concepts in the course and how everything works together as opposed to just pure memorization. It's a synthesis course.","The course is not the most interesting out there but it does provide you with really important knowledge of how the economy works. So take it if you want that knowledge, but don't expect to be mind-blown.","Ec 10 is a fantastic course; led by Professor Makniw it provides a great introduction to a very important topic.  The sections are useful and make up the majority of the course, but are still complemented by interesting lectures.  I strongly recommend this course to anyone who might be interested in Economics.  It is well run and will not disappoint.","it is pretty boring but useful","It is a great class but very difficult and takes alot of time.","Welcome to the best economics program in the country! EC10 is a bland course, with a little excitement in guest lecturers, but if you have ANY interest in doing economics whatsoever, take Ec10. It won't drastically change your mind, but even if you don't decide to do econ, at least it teaches essential knowledge for any citizen.","Macroeconomics is a bit tougher than micro. I think this was because instead of building on a few models, each chapters presents new theories. However, it is also much more interesting. I enjoyed this class, and was fortunate to have a great TF.","it's a necessary evil","good stuff","You've probably heard about David Johnson and how great of a head tf he is. Spoiler alert - 2014-2015 is his last school year teaching here. If you haven't taken Economics yet (which I highly recommend you do anyway), try to take it with Johnson. Even if he's not your section leader, his open office hours and reviews are fantastic. He's a dynamic teacher that makes graphing a supply curve interesting. That said, this really is a course you should take anyway, even if it is pass\/fail.","Ec 10 can be hard and frustrating. But, you do learn some things that I think are important to know about how the world works. It's a good class to see if you really do like economics. I just found out through taking this class that I really don't like economics.","You move fast and cover a lot of information so don't get behind","It may seem easy because everyone takes it, but to do well you really have to put in the time and effort. GO TO OFFICE HOURS.","Be ready to have to teach yourself a lot of the information.","This class is boring and if you have to take it, do. But otherwise, its not worth it.","I would tell them that this class provides a useful background in Economics.","I took this class because I thought economics would be useful to know. I struggled in the beginning because economics does not come easily to me, but the help I received from David Johnson made this class for me.","Make sure you take the unit tests. Not only do they give you extra credit, but they help you understand the material as well.","I personally enjoyed macro much more than micro. If you lower your expectations for how you will do in this course you will probably enjoy it.","Make sure you get a TF that is easy to learn from and willing to help you. Makes a huge difference.","You kinda know what you're getting into if you took Ec10a. I found macro to be more difficult than micro but I think it was actually the other way around for most of my peers. Not too much work and pretty useful basic information if you're going to be doing any work in and around the social sciences.","I would definitely recommend taking Ec10, no matter what your concentration is. You'll leave being more informed about the world and having a better sense of the world economy. You may end up having a good TF or a bad TF, but if you really want to learn the subject and figure out why it's important, go to David Johnson's office hours. He challenges you to actually think and explains the relevance of the pset questions. Take this class! It's worth your time.","I found Ec10b material significantly different from Ec10a, although the basic structure was the same. I felt like some of the concepts weren't explained that well or were explained in a hand-wavy way. In general, though, if you do the psets yourself and go over the practice exams to study, you'll do fine.","I'm not quite sure what I got out of Ec10 but given the chance I would take it again.","This class is required for a few concentrations, so many will have to take it; however, if you just need a US and the World, I advise you take another class. There are so many better courses that can give you a more enlightening experience, you shouldn't waste your time in Ec10 unless you have to. It's just pretty boring and very theoretical.","Recommending this course is a bit irrelevant, because most people need to take it and many others simply want to gain a basic understanding of economics, no matter how dumb the class is.","A must-take class; not well-taught and not well-structured but a basic intro into the macroeconomy","Go to DWJ's office hours whenever you can.","It can sometimes be tedious and very time-consuming. Many students who take it do not enjoy it very much, but it is a definitely good class to take because almost everyone does (it's the class taken with the most amount of students). It's also a good introductory class to learn about all of the economic concepts, especially if one is considering the subject as a concentration. And even if one isn't, the class still teaches many useful ideas that one can actually use in the real world.","Much easier and better than Ec 10a. The psets I would say are the worst part about it, just because they are so long and complicated a lot of the time. The material is much easier to master and has more real world applications.","It's one of those courses that everyone at Harvard takes and is standard for anyone considering the social sciences.","I believe that every student at Harvard should take this course, after taking this course you learn so much about how the world works and the interconnectedness of the global economy","This is a great course if you want to get some background in economics in terms of theory and some quantitative methods.","Honestly, you'll need to take this class - and economics is incredibly useful for practically ever field. It could be taught better, but for a class of this size, it could be worse.","They know you've got to take this course, so they expend zero effort to make it enjoyable for you.","Be ready to work on Psets on thursday nights","Your TF can make or break your Ec10 career."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I never thought that I would enjoy an economics class but Ec10 is very engaging and applicable to real world problems. It gives you a good foundation for evaluating economic policy. The problem sets are challenging but very effective in making sure you can apply the concepts. The tests are fair evaluations of what you learn. David Johnson is super enthusiastic and engaging.","If you can get Josh Bookin as a TF, you will be set. Even though Ec10 as a class is prone to making you feel anonymous, he takes the time to not only learn everyone's name, but also is incredibly open and helpful both in and outside of section. He's an incredible teacher who made the material (which at times was very hard to understand at first) quite accessible.","This class was a miserable experience. Only take it if you have to.","Do all the practice problems for the exams, they are challenging, but it is an interesting class","After taking this class, you will have a solid understanding of basic economics. How much individual work you need to put in to achieve this is somewhat determined by how helpful\/prepared your TF is during classes and office hours. The problem sets are fairly hard, but if you go to office hours for help they are much more manageable. The unit-test program is amazing and you should take advantage of it.","we need more mankiw lectures","People like to complain about Ec10 but it's better than most people say!","That although it may not be the most interesting class, it is necessary if you want to pursue a concentration in economics.","It's a great class if you have no prior experience in economics and are genuinely interested in the field.","Make sure your ready for the time commitment and know what you are getting into. I really liked the class though and that I can I understand concepts I hear on the news now.","This class is an introductory ec class. If I could go back I probably wouldn't take this course again but I don't know. Everyone should take some introductory economics.","This is one of the largest courses at Harvard that all students seem to take at one point or another, so I do think it's important to take this course for the solid foundation of microeconomic theory that it will give you. Ultimately, it's a manageable course if you study hard and manage your time well, and you will get a lot out of it if you do all the readings and psets!","Try not to get too caught up in the terms and definitions in the textbook; a better way to approach the course material is to think about the \"how\" and \"why\" of the big concepts, as well as how each of the concepts relates to each other.","Make sure to get a good TF, or find a better one to ask about psets; it's a huge class so stick up for yourself!!!","Good intro class to take if you're an economics concentrator, but be prepared for a lot of self-teaching","It's not a perfect class at all -- lectures are disappointing and your experience will hugely hinge on your TF. That said, the things you learn in EC10a are things any informed citizen should know. Don't let the imperfect environment in which you learn them deter you.","Stay on top of your readings and stay engaged in all sections and lectures","You learn a lot about economics from the course.","Go to David Johnson's' office hours. It will change your life. He is beyond amazing.","Gives a great overview of microeconomics","Start the P.sets as soon as you get the chance, go to lectures and section, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, read the book, and you should be just fine.","I loved the class, I had never done anything like economics before and thought it was fascinating. Don't listen to the people who say they didn't like it!","I actually don't mind it, but I feel like that is because of my TF more than anything. It is an okay course.","This course teaches a lot of material in a way that enables students to synthesize it all (or at least most of it).  David Johnson is a fantastic course head who is willing to go above and beyond to help students understand topics in his office hours and review sessions.  He is truly an amazing teacher and cares about students rather than research (and it is too bad he is leaving).  The fact that there were some very impressive guest lecturers in addition to the regular sections was useful in terms of understanding the topics in the book through section and then hearing about applications of these ideas in lecture.  The problem sets could also be done in groups, which is great if you have a lot of other work to do and can split the work up with a friend or two in section and then go over it together.  I feel that I now have a much better understanding of microeconomics.","Very difficult class but definitely worth it.  You learn a lot about how the world works.  A lot of important info that you will carry with you.  Even if you are not considering concentrating or getting a secondary in economics, everyone should take this class.  Psets and exams are really difficult but the curve is generous.","It is very difficult but you learn a lot.","Read the book.","I would say that if you're a first-year student looking to take this course because you might be interested in economics, avoid it until sophomore year.  You can definitely still be an economics concentrator without taking it during the fall of your first year.  It is definitely one of the worst courses that I have taken during my time at Harvard, and the only reason I took it was because it was required for my concentration.  Your experience is 100% dependent on your TF, and they vary in quality... a lot.  That said... if you have the time to dedicate to this course including going to office hours and doing all of the unit tests, it isn't too difficult, and you can do well... it just requires a lot of personal effort because the teaching isn't always the best.","Ec10a with Greg Mankiw is a good intro to the field of Economics. It gives a solid foundation for those wishing to concentrate in the subject, and it gives a good taste to those simply wishing to know a little about Economics. Ec10a does an excellent job of teaching students to \"think at the margin\" and view their actions and decisions from an economic perspective.","It's not particularly fun, but it is foundational. If you don't get a good TF at first, switch at all costs. David Johnson likes to draw test questions from the optional readings.","Very important for understanding the dynamics of human exchange","Ec 10 will teach you how to think in a new way and look at the world differently","Good course that teaches you all of the basics on microeconomics that one can then build off of later.","The course takes a lot of work. The more interested you are in course material and connect it with real life problems the easier course gets.","Exams hard, material interesting if you like math","This course is well taught and well organized. How difficult you will find it depends a lot on your experience with logic and your math ability. You don't need a lot of math, but you need to be proficient at algebra, otherwise this course will seem very difficult.","Everyone should know a little bit about how scarce resources are allocated.","You should take it for a basic understanding of the world.","As a class that is stereotypically full of freshman, it can still be pretty tough. If you have any interest in economics, it's definitely worth taking though. Make sure to find a section leader you like though, because the majority of the class is taught in section. Only a handful of lectures, but don't make the mistake of not going to any of them, because a lot more lecture questions appear on exams than you'd think.","This is a good gen ed, you should learn about the world and international trade.","I took this class a GenEd, but I now believe that economics will be my concentration. The concepts seem basic, but if you learn and enjoy the material, you can explore a whole range of issues from a different perspective.","Mankiw never shows up so don't be alarmed.  Pay attention in section.","This class does a good job of teaching the basic knowledge of economics but it's pretty boring if you don't really like the subject matter.","Ec 10a is a challenging course, but it is manageable if your keep up with the textbook readings. Additionally, if you have a background in microeconomics (high school AP level), you should be very confident in your ability to succeed in this course.","Take it if you are interested in econ at all. Can be boring and difficult but it is clear that the ideas apply to the real world as evidenced in lectures.","It is necessary in order to pursue a concentration in Economics, but even if you're not, the knowledge it gives you is very useful and applicable to every day life.","Ec 10 is the only introductory economics class offered at Harvard, so take it if you want to use economics in the future. However, take everything that you learn in the class with a grain of salt. Understand that the course offers a biased sample of microeconomic thinking, and claims objectivity for extremely subjective statements.\n\nStudents who take Professor Mankiw on his word will leave the class believing it to be simple economic fact that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment or that the Laffer Curve has real-world implications when there is not anything close to consensus on these ideas within the economic community. The course teaches a philosophy that values profit over people and uses a logic of generalized assumptions backed up by little concrete data.","If you are interested in working on Wall Street, this class is largely irrelevant to such a profession.  In fact, the field of Economics seems to only have relevance in the public sector and consists of mostly abstract concepts.  So, if you have taken Ec prior and disliked it, I can't say that this class will be enjoyable for you.  Don't just take this course because you think it will signal a future interest in working in finance, take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject.","This course should not be called Greg Mankiw's course-- the head TF creates and runs the entire course, with Makiw featured a handful of times throughout the semester if you're lucky. His lack of effort\/participation in the course is frustrating. It is taught entirely in section.","work HARD. put in a lot of time.","Ec10 can be a great and extremely informative class, if you are willing to put in the time commitment. I opted to taking the Problem Sets slow because that's just how I learned the material. So someone like me would have to put aside quite some time for this course.","This course will help one understand important and fundamental economic concepts. It encourages one to use a variety of approaches in the pursuit of this knowledge. It is fun while being interesting at the same time.","If your section leader is bad, switch, it makes all the difference. Use the helpful hints, they and the problem sets will get you used to the way test questions are asked--same flow\/format etc.","I learned a lot in this course, but you will definitely notice that it is a course designed for 600 students to be able to take and succeed in - there is a very generous curve on most exams. Make sure you pay attention in lecture! There will be lecture questions on exams and if you did not listen, you will not know the answers. Those are points that are not worth losing.","I wouldn't take this class unless you really really liked economics or it's a requirement.","Well it is the only option, so you have to take it. I would tell people to definitely keep up with their work and make sure that they understand key concepts soon after they are introduced, as if you wait too long you will have much more trouble. Definitely keep up with the readings.","The class is very straightforward. Read the textbook, do the problems, go to section and lecture, study and you will make it through. Obviously try your best to get a good TF and when in doubt ask other TFs or David Johnson for help. You will learn a lot and many find the material relevant if not interesting.","The class is easy but you have to teach yourself the material and go to David Johnson's office hours because the section TFs aren't very good.","This is a wonderful course for people thinking about concentrating economics or not! I recommend you take it to understand the foundation of economics.","A must-take if you haven't already taken AP Microeconomics in high school. As cliche as it sounds, it's true- economics is such a powerful factor that shapes our day-to-day lives, so understanding it is key to becoming a more informed individual and citizen. The workload is relatively light (consisting only of 6 required problem sets and 3 exams for the whole semester) and if you have good quantitative reasoning skills then this class should be enjoyable and relatively straightforward. That being said, your experience in Ec 10 largely depends on your section leader since the vast majority of the course is taught in section, and I have heard that there is a wide variety in quality among the different section leaders. However, mine was excellent and so I found the course to be very enjoyable. Also- take the unit tests!!!","Ec10 is a great class with a ton of resources to absorb the curriculum if you stay on top of the work and take advantage of those resources (office hours, unit tests, helpful hints, etc.). You have to be more actively engaged in the class than you might think (from the large lectures and section sizes)- it's a very individual experience and about how much initiative you take to use the course's resources.","its a useful course, but also somewhat rigorous.","Okay, so, you're not taking this class because you particularly want to take Ec 10. You take it because you have to - either to be an Ec concentrator or because your other social science requires it, or because your academic advisor is somewhat dull in the head. Either way, it's not going to be a particularly pleasant experience. Work in section is straightforward-enough, problem sets are somewhat challenging, but perfectly fine if you go to office hours. Exams are tricky, to make a distinction in ability among the giant class. Make sure to study. Take it if you must, but certainly place out if you have AP scores.","Make sure you take advantage of office hours and extra help sessions, even if they happen to be with various TFs","Succeeding in the course requires a large time commitment but it is very rewarding.","Read the textbook because TFs and section are not particularly helpful. Lectures and extra readings are not relatively important for exams.","Go to David Johnson's office hours.","You should take this course. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's impersonal. But you do learn, and you learn a lot. Not just economics, but how to think. Everyone should HAVE to take this course.","Ec10a is a course that applies to multiple fields and provides you with a strong foundation for Ec10b and beyond, so you will find that this course will help you a lot in the future. I advise that you always attend the lectures and read the textbook to get the most out of it. The course is designed for those who havn't taken economics before, but if you have already taken it in high school, then that knowledge would be useful background for you.","If you know the math, you'll be extremely bored, but still get the intuition.","This class isn't that hard if you take the time to learn the materials, but this is especially important if you don't have a good TF.","It's not that interesting. Kind of generic.","People often have negative views about Ec 10a but I honestly think it is a close that is worth taking. You get out of it what you put into it and if you put in the time it is a very rewarding class.","Basically your performance is tied with your TF's performance.","I think it is extremely important to learn the material covered in this class, as it genuinely explained a lot of things about how the world works to me in areas that I didn't even realise I had a deficiency in my understanding in, but I felt that it was a poorly designed course, which made covering the material much more painful to go through than it should have. Also, the fact that the people who do best in this course are those who have already taken some Economics, or spend a lot of extra time on their own on the material, would suggest that the course is not effective. I would therefore consider Ec10 a necessary evil.","Greg Mankiw","This course is foolishly taught via sections from often poor TFs rather via than lecture from a good teacher. This is so that Harvard can keep its average class size numbers down, but has a terrible effect on the course by making it inconsistent and inequitable. A horribly run course with great unrealized potential to better inform the views of all those who take it. With the departure of David Johnson I'm afraid it'll only get worse - until they finally realize its worth the statistical hit to just teach via lecture and have everybody learn from a good instructor.","Read the textbook.","Go to office hours (Especially David Johnson's) and you will understand the course material a lot better.","Good stuff to know but not taught very well","This is a challenging course, perhaps less so if you have taken Economics in high school. Even if you did, you might learn some new things. Take the optional unit exams, even though they sometimes test on a few topics and concepts that aren't covered in the course textbook, or even in section. The real exams are harder than necessary.","Great introductory economics course, but don't hold your breath for Mankiw lectures.","Take this course if you have to; avoid it if you don't.","The textbook is not enough","This class can be great if you get a good section teacher. If not, it can be pretty frustrating, but still good. Lectures, however, are very good and interesting. Also the textbook is very straightforward.","It's very hard, but you will really learn a lot about economics.","really depends on the TF you get","Don't take this class because everyone else is taking it.","It was a great class, especially if one takes advantage of opportunities such as office hours to make the most out of the course.","Pay attention in section and do the unit tests!","I took this class as someone who does not intend to concentrate in economics, but wanted to learn the basics in order to help future studies of international relations\/to be a good global citizen. While it is a good introductory course in that it is careful not to demand more of students than they would be able to do as beginners in the field, it is a terrible introductory course for someone like me--it doesn't teach a lot of \"real economics\" but rather focuses either on a very shallow overview that is basically just common sense, or on silly details that won't be important or memorable in the long run. The class is also terribly and frustratingly organized, and is overall a bad experience. Don't take this unless you have to for concentration requirements.","Whether you like Ec or not and your success in the course all depends on your TF. Simple enough.","Ec10 was a lot of fun for me. Your experience will depend a lot on your TF and if you keep up with the readings. You will struggle if you try to just go to section because they don't cover everything in the textbook.","Valuable if interested in economics, but a significant time\/effort commitment, and not many lectures.","Doing the reading from Mankiw's book will help you! Many students don't bother to do it, and could have benefited from it.","Everyone should take introductory economics. It is fundamental to understanding the modern world in which we live.","If you don't understand something, ABSOLUTELY GET HELP IMMEDIATELY. Every concept builds on the previous concept, and missing any key point will result in you being continually lost as more concepts get piled on which don't make sense. Go to all the office hours you can, you really need it. Bring your psets there, because these psets take forever.","PSETs are long and hard and there is a lot of material to cover for exams, if you get a good TF it makes the class much more fun. Go to office hours","Iconic class, why not take it?  Basic economic principles useful in everyday life.","If you want to broaden your perspective on politics take this course.","Decent amount of work but very rewarding!","Take this course if you're interested in ec -- you kind of have to. As a gen ed it wouldn't be a bad course, though maybe more work than necessary and it can be dry. Don't take it for Mankiw because he only lectures a few times. Also buy the old edition textbook, it's the same as the new one and it's $300 cheaper.","Understand that you won't get taught by actual professors most of the time","I think you should only take this if you're considering being an economics concentrator. I think there are much better classes if you'd like to fulfill the General Education Requirement. Also, you might want to do the readings as I think this class will be a lot worse without David Johnson, he's a bro.","I enjoyed learning the material in this class. Just try to keep on top of things because it's hard to catch up since a lot of the material is cumulative. Go to office hours.","This course is not a great course because essentially all the material is taught in section by graduate students so your experience really depends on your section tf. The lectures are an interesting supplement to section as you apply the material to the actual world. Take this course because you have no choice if you want to move up to higher level economics courses taught by actual professors.","Move out of your section as soon as possible if you have a very poor teaching fellow.","Difficult, but necessary for greater understanding of society. Even if this is not a concentration requirement, it is very applicable to many different fields.","Very boring material. Most likely due to the tf I had, and I had friends who said their tfs did a great job. So how much you like the class will absolutely depend on the tf you have.","Ec10: A giant conspiracy formulated by Greg Mankiw to get a bunch of saps to buy his $200 textbook","Best advice I can give is to make sure you are happy with your TF. Having a bad TF will ruin the learning experience for you.","It is a necessary burden to study economics. Find students to study with!","Very good class. You learn a lot about economics, but also about government and public policy.","I went from loving the theory of economics to absolutely despising it.","Take it as a sophomore. Seriously.","If you have taken economics before go for it! If not, take this with friends","If you've never taken Econ before, this is a great introductory class. If you took AP Econ, micro and\/or macro in high school and are debating whether or not to take this course or to take a higher level of econ, take this course. While I didn't really learn much in section, the minimal amount of work and great lectures (however few there are) made this course worth it.","Always do the exam review materials and make use of your TF's office hours for help on the more advanced concepts in the Psets and on the exam review materials.","To take this class, you have to be ready to dedicate substantial time to the thorough completion of readings and problem sets. However, the course material is very interesting, and all of the TFs are very accessible and very willing to answer any questions you have. If you take the time to understand the concepts, the exams, although difficult, are manageable. I highly recommend this course!!","Yeah, this class can be somewhat annoying sometimes. But let's face it, economics is important to know in today's world. This class is effective at teaching it, so students should take it. And it's not that bad, the problem sets are gone over in office hours and if you study seriously for the tests you will do fine considering the curve.","Your experience really depends on the section leader you get. Even the curves depend on your exam\/ section group, so there's nothing much you can do.","This course has a lot of potential. The material is interesting, and I've definitely left with a different perspective on key economic issues such as the minimum wage and the carbon tax. However, I found section to be basically be a boring summation of the textbook, problem sets were tedious, and the exams asked very specific unfair questions from lectures. The material is great, but it's just delivered poorly. Mankiw, the \"professor\" is inacessible and holds office hours randomly and infrequently. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have taken this class, but with a little reform, it could have been much better","Do not shy away from Ec10 just because you have heard horror stories about it, but also do not take it unless you have a genuine interest in the material, otherwise you will be pretty miserable for a semester.","I thought this was a great course. It really increased my understanding of economics. Just to give a little background, I'm a sophomore with absolutely no econ experience and I found the course to be both easy and really manageable. The problem sets were not time intensive or particularly difficult. I didn't have much time to study for the exams, but really all you have to do is spend some time on the practice exam materials. Naturally, due to the nature of the course, it all depends on your section leader.","If you don't love economics it is a challenging course although the applications of theories are interesting","It's a standard intro to economics course. They teach you a lot of stuff in terms of graphs and lines and algebra.","Ec 10 is an essential class. It is not particularly engaging, it is not particularly exciting, and it will probably not succeed in making you love economics. That said, the basic concepts of Microeconomics are important in every field. This class, if nothing else, does a good job of explaining these basic concepts. It is not a class I would take for fun, but it's also not one I would have skipped. The problem sets are doable, the tests are pretty doable as well, and sections aren't terrible (mind you, I had a good section leader) My suggestion is, grit your teeth, accept that you'll want to take it eventually, and get it out of the way freshman year.","Ec10 is an awesome opportunity to develop a strong base of understanding in economics while also learning to problem solve and think critically. You truly get as much out of this class as you put in, and if you are dedicated to putting in the time and working with the course material, this class will be a very valuable and memorable academic experience for you!","The content presented is very good and provides a good introduction to economics. Your experience will most likely depend on what section you are placed into as the content is entirely taught in section. If you haven't taken economics before I would be prepared to do some additional study each week.","didn't love it","It's necessary for a lot of things. Just gotta deal with it. Not too bad if your section leader is good.","Take it if you have to, I suppose.","It's not a difficult class but will require a few periods of intense work.","ec10a was a good class. Decently well run. I believe it depends on who the TF you get is.","Ec 10 is a solid class that equips you with the basic tools of economics while at the same time teaching you concepts that are relatable to real life. Also, David Johnson is an amazing teacher and it is so sad that he will be leaving. When I was preparing to take Ec. 10, I asked people who had taken it before for advice and they kept on hammering \"Go to David Johnson's office hours\". I didn't understand what that meant until I actually went to Office Hours. All the concepts that I struggled to understand in section became so much more clearer.","It's a good course, but your success really has a great deal to do with your proctor.  By success I mean comprehension of the material.","It's a class every student should take","Enjoy it. It's awesome.","This is a challenging class, especially if you haven't taken micro before, which many of the people taking the class have.  But, you learn a ton and will be a better informed citizen and voter.","I really liked this course-- it gave me very strong foundations on economics. However, I sometimes feel that the TF's are not well prepared and that there is a lack of communication between the course heads and the TF's.","Make use of the optional unit exams, they help a lot in solidifying your understanding of the material","This is a great course, I wouldnt recommemend skipping","I actually wish this class becomes a General Education requirement. It develops a more critical lens in policy and it really is effective for all disciplines.","Good way to get a gen ed out of the way and also it's just good to take ec10 but it was pretty boring. Wasn't that difficult, but a bad TF can really change the course.","Don't take this class for a Gen Ed. Trust me!","The psets are challenging and quite often only distantly related to section and lecture. However, they provide you the opportunity to creatively apply what you've learned and to view the material in new lights. This is a great course if you have any interest in the field at all.","Good material for everybody to have an understanding of.","I would recommend future students pace themselves and work at understanding concepts gradually and not try to cram all at once.","This is a difficult course.  However, I came out with a much better understanding of economics.  (Although my previous knowledge was non-existent.)","If you take this class don't take it because you think the great Greg Mankiw will be teaching it! He has nothing (I wish i could bold that) to do with the actual course.","Can be kinda dull sometimes, but I learned a lot and it's all stuff that you should know before you go out in the real world","It is a great way of learning how the world is run.","If you have good mathematical instincts and have taken the AP, you will probably be better off skipping this course. I took this class because I read the AP textbook and took the exams but have never been in an actual economics class. I would suggest shopping the intermediate level class if you're willing to push yourself a little bit harder. \nGo to lectures. Professor Mankiw reiterated a lot of what is in his textbook in the earlier lectures, but the later ones are more engaging. The guest lectures were about interesting topics even though the lecturers might not be the most charismatic. Personally, I was inspired to read several books about startups, behavioral economics, game theory, and welfare reforms after being exposed to some big questions through sections, guest lectures, optional readings, and problem sets.","Econ 10 is a great class. Lectures are interesting and topics learned in this course help you better understand policies about the economy","If you have the right section leader, this course could be extremely enjoyable.","Tough class but if you apply yourself it's very rewarding.","Be wary of the workload","N\/A","With David Johnson running the class, Ec10 was incredible. He was so fiercely intelligent and caring about his students and the class. I'm not sure what it will be like without him. Lectures are scarce, and not too informative. Section is completely hit or miss. But you will absolutely learn the principles of microeconomics if you take this course, no matter who the head teaching fellow is. Just beware that the Q guide might not give an accurate reflection of the class because the class' heart and soul, David Johnson, is unfortunately leaving.","Make sure you keep up with the readings, especially if you do not have a good TF.","The class can be extremely rewarding and interesting or not depending on your effort.","Good starting foundation for economics","Only really take this class if you need to. Mankiw is awful, the textbook is pretty bad, and section is boring.","It is a great class and in order to do well it is important to stay up to date on the readings","I think one thing you need to realize with this class is that it is suited for those who have taken econ before. It does not mean that it makes this course easier if you do have a background, but it means be prepared to work very hard. This course is not easy, especially if economics does not come naturally. Don't hesitate to go to your TF's office hours or another TF's hours. Also, don't hesitate to find a tutor. Honestly, don't worry if you do bad on your tests. There is a curve and many opportunities for you to get help. However, if you feel like after one semester the class isn't for you that is totally okay.","I would say that learning how to think in terms of economics is useful, but that the course itself is flawed.","Ec10 is a great class overall. It definitely has the potential to help you become a more informed citizen, and every Harvard student should understand basic economics. However, the class experience depends almost solely on your TF and your experience in section. Lecture is definitely a chore, and not much teaching\/learning happens during lecture. Section can be an amazing, eye-opening experience, and the psets\/exams are all designed for in-depth learning. Even if you got a mediocre TF, David Johnson's office hours and review sessions, which were must-attend, were open to all. Unfortunately, with David Johnson leaving at the end of the 2014-2015 school year, who knows what Ec10 will look like in the future.","Even if not required, this class is a great way to get a basic education in economics that will help you be a more informed citizen.","It is a very thought provoking class that let's you view the world in a much more analytical way. It forces you to think outside the box and this concept is very enjoyable for many students as myself. Problem sets are engaging and relevant. The only complaint I have is how impersonal Mankiw is with the class. He rarely lectures and barely teaches anything. Everything is done by our TFs. David Johnson (Head TF) is a boss but he's leaving so econ will be slightly different next year.","lot of work but worth it","Unless you have taken economics before (and maybe even if you have), this class is hard work, but there are many resources in place to help you out. Just make sure that you can set aside the time to take advantage of them all: TF's office hours, Unit Tests, optional psets, etc. All worth doing.","Ask someone for a PDF version of an older version of the textbook. The price of the current edition is outrageous.","It is a useful course and a smart choice to take it.","Read for understanding not memorization! Synthesis synthesis synthesis. All of the concepts build upon each other so if you skip the first few chapters because you think they're simple you will have a  rocky foundation. Go to officer hours for help not answers, you should have at least tried something on your own. Do all the practice tests.","Do problem sets early.","David Johnson is the strength of this class. He is literally amazing. He has so many office hours and makes himself available for the students. His explanations and enthusiasm for the subject matter is really inspiring and comprehensive. What I got out of this class came out from the few times I went to his review sessions or office hours.That being said...very few people are lucky enough to get into David Johnson's section. How your semester goes really will be based on whom you get as a TF. Anyone can do well in the class by getting extra help but how much extra work you put in will depend on your TF.","make sure to understand the material and not put it off for a later date","Ec10a is a great class and a great intro to the field of economics. The key to having a good experience with this class is getting a good TF, and I was lucky enough to get Stephanie. If you keep up with the material and the readings, it is not a difficult class, but it is very easy to get behind.","You will learn some economics. You will be frustrated sometimes by the rather dogmatic views held by the Mank. You will take a few exams and do a bunch of problem sets. You'll have more fun elsewhere, but like me, you probably have to take this.","Difficult but does give you an understanding that is useful in everyday life.","Be prepared to be challenged and have your eyes opened to this world. Very interesting and mind blowing stuff.","Do your problem sets early, and go to David Johnson's office hours.","This is an awesome course!  The material is very interesting and the teachers are great.  It really opens your eyes to how the world works around you and how people make decisions.  No previous economics background is necessary to take the course.","A standard requirement for Ec concentrators but also interesting as an introduction to how markets work for general knowledge.","This is a very good introductory course to economics.  Lectures are generally unhelpful, but David Johnson is amazing.","This course probably epitomizes the common belief that at Harvard \"you'll never meet or be taught by a  professor.\" Unfortunately, lectures are infrequent and very rare, especially lectures with Mankiw himself. The subject material is interesting, and entirely depends on your section TF. Problem sets take a long time, and if you don't go to office hours I truly don't know how you can complete them successfully, especially since problem solving is not taught in section, and certainly not in lecture.","As someone who had never before taken an economics class, I found this course to be a very enjoyable introduction to the subject. The material was the right balance of challenging and manageable, which I appreciated.","Just about everyone winds up taking Ec10 at some point, and though the course is flawed, it still manages to convey the basic principles of the field.  Since the world basically runs on economics, this course will help you to be a functional citizen.  But you're not going to enjoy it unless you're a soulless libertarian robot.","It won't blow your mind or change the way you think (at least it didn't for me), but you'll learn about economic modeling and microeconomic theory.","It is an interesting class that made me consider switching my concentration to economics.","Your mileage with this class depends heavily on your section.\n\nLots of times, the concepts covered in section don't necessarily convert well to understanding and completing the psets.","This class provides theoretical foundations to analyze incentives and choices, and their effects on consumers and producers alike.","Important if you want to do Ec, or are even thinking about it, but I may not be the greatest experience. Somewhat of a necessary evil","If you've taken AP Microeconomics, take a higher level course because this course will not be challenging nor rewarding. Most of the course will be review. Also, your experience with the course depends highly on the section leader that you get assigned.","The problem sets may be challenging,  but they are manageable and essential to your understanding. Also, the application of concepts in problem form is more difficult than one would assume so spend a lot of time practicing and take Unit Exams.","This course was extremely difficult for me due to my selected section leader. He was inexperienced and due to this, I had a hard time understanding the concepts. It all comes down to getting lucky. If you have a decent professor, you will do fine in the class.","This class is really hard. Unless you are very serious about economics or have taken the course before, I wouldn't recommend it.","It's definitely interesting from a non-concentrator point of view. However, it is a very time-consuming class and the material is often a little difficult.","This class is boring and slow. If you took AP Economics in high school, SKIP THIS CLASS. Try at any cost to get into 1010a. Furthermore, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. They have a captive audience in that you have to take this course to take other ec courses which is a shame because this class is so impersonal, scripted, and uninteresting.","Not very good teaching. Have to do a lot of learning independently.","Ec10 is really worth taking. If you work hard and have a good section leader, you will be able to do well. The exams are very reasonable and not worth stressing about. You will be well prepared if you pay attention in section. There's always some material in the lectures that gets tested on the exams, so they're absolutely worth going to, not to mention that some of the lectures are by very prominent economists. Ec10a is a great way to knock out a gen ed requirement and see if economics is of interest to you.","Try to take Ec 1010 if you have any prior Ec experience at all.","I believe that all students should take this course to have an understanding of economics","It's a great class that teaches you a lot.","At times it may seem frustrating and you may be cursing Mankiw for lecturing so little, but at the end of the day it teaches you what you need to know, and you need to know the material and understand basic economics to understand our world and be an informed citizen.","It is definitely a good class to take to get a good understanding of economics.","If you want to be an economics major, you have to take it. That said, EC 10 is fairly difficult and if you don't keep up, it can quickly become overwhelming. Do your homework, go to section, GO TO LECTURES, and take notes.","it't not too hard but going to section is annoying","Whether you will like Econ 10a depends on two things:\n1. Whether you have a good TF (which is pure luck -- although some switching is allowed)\n2. Whether you naturally like economics \nThe course isn't set up in a way that it makes economics interesting for people who wouldn't normally find it so -- only take this class if you actually like economics.","Great for those who never took Ec and are interested in the material\/ want something resembling some sort of business class. A good TF is key and the curve is generous.","I feel like how much you'll take out of this course is largely dependent on the quality of your TF.  I had a great TF, so I enjoyed the class, but I know others who feel differently.","Take it seriously and it wont be too hard.","This class is manageable. The material may not be the most interesting, but it's necessary to learn if you are going to concentrate in econ. I was actually surprised by the volume of information I learned about micro  by the end of the semester. The information really starts to click a few weeks into the course. The psets can be tricky but you can get them done fairly easily if you go to office hours. You will do well on exams (they are heavily curved) if you take the time to study and understand all of the concepts. Take this class if you are really interested in econ or are going to concentrate in econ; however, don't take this as an easy gen ed as the course does require a good deal of work.","Choose a good section leader.","It's necessary.","This course gives a good foundation of economics but sometimes the topics and important concepts get lost along the way. Although not necessary, having some sort of an economics background is extremely helpful. Even just studying some things on your own beforehand might make this course a little easier.","Ec10a and Ec10b are very useful classes if you desire to be an informed citizen. While 10a can seem like an oversimplification at times, it (along with Ec10b) gives students some critical basic economics knowledge. Make sure you have a good TF - if you do not, switch immediately.","Unless you get a good TF, it is very hard to learn effectively in this class. Most learning I did was on my own outside of the section.","Read the textbook and listen in section, but be prepared to apply the basic concepts strenuously to complete the problem sets. Going to office hours is imperative to success.","- one's Ec 10 experience depends on how much work one is willing to put in","go to office hours","It's fun and useful!!!","I strongly recommend this class. Ec10, aside from serving as the foundation course for economics, will change how you think about your life and the world and will make you are more effective citizen.\nIt is a shame that David Johnson is leaving, though, because he literally made the course. I don't know what it will be like without him.\nTry to start the PSets early. They tend to take 5-6 hours. They are not deathly difficult, but are certainly time-consuming.\nGo to Mankiw's office hours. He is a very cool guy and highly intelligent: you can definitely learn a lot there (both in terms of material and in the way an expert economist structure his thoughts).","This is a good course for anyone looking to get a better understanding of how the US and world economies work. As an introduction course, however, it only skates on the surface of a lot of interesting topics. The class is also very manageable in terms of time and difficulty. Your experience in the course depends a lot on what TF you get for section, so if your TF isn't great, I'd recommend switching early on.","This class is not going to be easy! Be prepared to spend lots of time outside class studying, processing, practicing, and trying to understand the material -- problem sets are notoriously stymieing. Lectures are few and far between and sections are very much a gamble. Overall the material is informative and useful, but the concepts and class structure are tough.","Switch out of a section with a bad TF","Ec10a does a good job of teaching the foundation of economics. However, because the class is taught primarily in section, the teaching is based on your section leader. The class is pretty easy.","Hard, but interesting class.","How much you end up learning from this class completely depends on the caliber of your TF. Pray for a knowledgable TF come sectioning time! The guest lecturers tend to be very interesting, informative, and related to relavant social\/economic issues. Mankiw's lecture are not as exciting.","If you are interested in economics, but have never taken an economics course before, take this course to see if you might want to pursue the topic in the future.","Take this class. It's interesting and provides the important base you need for further study in economics.","This class was very informative overall.","Great intro to economics class--came in without ever taking any classes in econ, and feel that I have gained a lot from Ec10. The experience really depends on your section leader, though","It's not very engaging unless you are a concentrator or into economics","Good introduction to Microeconomics, but nothing too exciting. The class is definitely dry but it teaches you everything you need to know to decide whether or not you want to concentrate in Economics.","I took this class as a junior which was both a great and terrible decision. It was great because I know more about what I want to get out of my time at Harvard, so I was less stressed about each problem set and could see the big picture without focusing on each week's assignments and readings. It was terrible because I wish I had taken it earlier. I declared a different concentration, and at this point, I do not have enough time to switch my concentration. Had I taken it freshman or sophomore year, I would have declared Economics. I recommend taking it sophomore year. It is a stressful class to take as a freshman, but don't take it too late. It's incredible, and taking Ec10 was one of the best decisions I've made at Harvard.","Course structure needs work but course content is good.","Take the unit tests, use the helpful hints posted on the course site, and read the textbook (including the supplemental boxes\/asides). Start your psets early so you have time to go to office hours. Know that you aren't restricted to your TF's office hours--you can go to office hours held by other TFs, David Johnson (or the next course head), etc. Understand that Mankiw is conservative and that the course is introductory. You have to wade through the conceptual, foundational material before getting to the interesting real-world or interdisciplinary applications of economics. Some of the lectures do give you a glimpse of what lies ahead.","it's incredibly difficult, like you have to put in a ton of extra time, harder than it seems","Be ready to work a lot on problem sets and to integrate concepts that typically aren't related to one another in high school economics.","If you have no experience in economics, this is the course to take to learn about the subject.","I took this course as an elective, and I am glad I took it because I think it helped me understand a basic level of how markets work. The workload isn't too bad, and there's help available. I've also heard that Ec 10b is something better suited for real-world applications, which is something to keep in mind.","It's a good way to learn Microeconomics","The class is necessary for the Ec concentration, but by no means expect a fun or entertaining class. It's basic Ec, and nothing more.","If you've already taken AP and done well, this class should be easy, but still interesting.","Even though the course instructor is professor Mankiw, you do not see him more than three times, therefore I recommend you to resection immediately if you are not satisfied with your TF's performance, since your liking of the course is very dependent on your TF's way of teaching. I was not content with my TF, Jay Weng, at all, which made the course very disappointing for me. Overall the material of the course generates a good understanding of the neoclassical economic systems which play a very significant role in understanding how the world works today. The PSets are very long and time consuming, so be prepared for long nights working on Econ.","It's EC10a, you can't not take it because it's requirement. So it's as enjoyable as a good required course, but certainly not an elective. Mankiw is the worst - pray for a good TF.","I only took Ec10 because it's required for my possible concentration. I thought that I would hate it, so I wanted to get my one semester of econ out of the way as soon as possible. Turns out, I really enjoyed it! Will be back for more with Ec10b in the spring. It's very logical and intuitive, and it can be very rewarding to gain insights on so many aspects that affect the world around us. Lectures are boring and pretty unnecessary, except for some excellent guest lecturers, but if you have an engaging TF, the material can be really interesting and not too challenging.","Do the readings!","Ec10a was better than I expected it, and better than its reputation. The material is pretty important for everyone in general to understand. You should understand it is a section-based course, and it would be a mistake to expect a lecture course by Mankiw (who lectured about 6 times). Because of this, it might feel more like a high school course. Beware of your section leader's shortcomings.","Just keep up with the readings and go to section.  Section teaches you a majority of the information so don't skip out on it.  Also, make sure to go to office hours. They are a lifesaver for the psets as well as the exams.","This class is all about your TF, so do your best to get into a good TF's section. David Johnson is unfortunately leaving Harvard, so I'm not sure who the best TF will be. However, if you're hesitant at all about your TF during the first week or two, don't be afraid to switch because that will make all the difference as the semester wears on and the material gets more complicated.","This class is a pretty standard introduction to micro-economics. It is mostly taught in sections. As long as you go to section and pay attention, you will not feel lost. Go to lectures because while they are not central to the exams, there will be multiple choice questions about them.","Its really hard and very stressful","David Johnson is a god. It is sad that future students won't get him. Make sure to transfer into a good section. Do the psets in a timely fashion and the class isn't that hard. I took as a junior and it was very nice and relatively stress-free","Work hard and it will be rewarding.","Difficult but worth it.","Very questionable section teaching and lecture material is tested but can learned from reading slides so lectures are not worth going to (Cutler and Laibson are great though).","It will open your mind to previously unthought of possibilities","It's the big intro ec class - important for any potential ec concentrators to take.  You have to put in the work to do well but it's not too hard to do well. Make sure you study a lot for the 2nd midterm because it's much harder than the first.","This class is the capitalist machine and they're not even shy about it. Take it\nto know how an economist thinks though because that has a lot of utility and the opportunity cost... Oh no. They got to me! Save yourselves!","Take this class if it is a requirement for a concentration or want to take more advanced economics, but it is such a basic look at economics that if you are just looking to understand economics it provides such an idealized look at the system that is not entirely applicable to the real world.","This class is very important to be a knowledgable citizen, but it should absolutely be two gen eds for both semesters.","Take the unit tests, keep up with the readings, and go to David Johnson's office hours when you have questions. If you can stay on top of the material, the class is really straightforward, simple, and a nice way of knocking out the Empirical Reasoning GenEd. Also look at the past exams and problems sets, because the majority of exam questions are directly ripped from\/slightly modified versions of questions from previous tests and homework.","As a sophomore in ec10, I really enjoyed it.  It's straightforward, it's manageable, and it's interesting.  There is no confusion around what is expected of you, and there are no surprises in ec10.  There are many resources available in ec10: varied office hours and unit tests are especially helpful.  Take it!  Even if you aren't planning on concentrating in economics, it's a good class to have taken.","Take this class! Even if you have no intention of concentrating in economics, this class teaches you the basics of economics that are useful for a better understanding of the basics of our economy","Seriously consider your GPA before you take this class, as you'll see a large drop simply due to the horrible curves on Economics 10a tests.","Read the textbook before section as you go. It would make studying for midterms and the final much easier. Go to office hours!!!!","This course has problem sets that will take you a long time, exams that are tricky and really require you to think deeply and critically about applying concepts, and lectures that are often boring and\/or biased and\/or irrelevant to the rest of the course. However, it does teach you a lot about economic principles and gives a solid basis for understanding some policies and markets. David Johnson is an awesome teacher and you should go to his office hours and review sessions to clarify topics, especially if your section leader is not on point (and many are not).","It's not great being taught almost exclusively by TF's. If you're interested in economics though, you kind of have to take it.","it is not the most fun course, but you do learn a lot.","Do not fall behind","Definitely worth taking, especially if you've never studied economics before. It'll change the way you look at a lot of institutions and processes and that's pretty cool. The TFs are generally pretty strong (mine was great) and the exams and material hard but rewarding if you put in solid work. I think having a ec background is super important, so it was totally worth it to me. Just be aware: Mankiw is not super helpful, nor a very good lecturer, and he does have a political bias - it's not too bade but it helps to take his lectures with a bit of a grain of salt.","If you don't have an understanding of economics going into the course, this course is difficult and poorly structured.  Also it's hard to imagine anyone truly enjoying the course with any tf other than David Johnson.","Keep up with the readings.","Excellent course overall.  One will feel incredibly accomplished at the end of the semester for ones increased problem solving capabilities and more flexible way of thinking.  Information is applicable to everyday life, so the course is great for people intending to concentrate in the subject or just taking it out of personal interest.","The course is difficult but manageable","Just sit tight and wait till it's over. The skills it provides are necessary to any understanding of economics; with that, though, comes the fact that there are 800 people all in the same boat. Microeconomics is far less interesting than macro, but in order to take the latter, I would recommend the former. Ec10 is type of course that makes many critics of Harvard accuse us of not prioritizing undergraduate studies. Though such a statement is far from the actual truth, my experience with Ec10 is that it is part of a minority of courses whose goals do not include fostering intimate learning.","Definitely take this class! Especially if you are interested in politics or public policy. This course is interesting, engaging, and not excessively time-consuming. It is also very relevant to the real world and may give you deeper insight into the world and into economic policies! Would recommend 10\/10","This class is the foundation of economics, which is the foundation of the world's functionality.","Mankiw hardly lectures, unfair grading system, unrealistically hard problem sets, learned a lot though","read the textbook","This isn't a particularly engaging class, and so you end up digesting a lot of information, often without learning its implications.","Great preparation for life in general. Economics makes just reading articles (the paper is for chumps) much more enjoyable","Very challenging for some, for others it comes naturally. If you have taken microeconomics before, I strongly recommend, however, those who have not are frankly a step behind.","Rather unexpectedly, Ec10a ended up being the course that I learned the most from freshman fall. Ec10a provides a broad introduction to the major concepts in microeconomics. The textbook is really very well-written, and David Johnson, while crazy, is brilliant. If you're interested in learning more about \"the economy\" (which, before I came to Harvard, was an abstract, unclear concept) and how politics is involved in the economy, this is the course for you. It's not hard, but psets can be annoying -- definitely find someone to work with, because it makes the work go faster.","Ec 10a is a good class that could be a phenomenal class. The material is actually quite interesting, and  some of the TF's are very good, but I had a very poor TF experience. From my perspective, I'd have preferred to have David Johnson (who is a phenomenal teacher!) teach the content covered in section, in a lecture format. As for the existing lectures, they're quite interesting!","This class is very good especially when you collaborate on the psets. Not only does it offset the workload but it also helps in terms of group learning.","Do the problem sets by yourself and make sure you fully understand what you are doing.","Entirely depends on how good your section leader is. I worry for this course after David Johnson has left.","It's a decent amount of work but is not that difficult. The class often seems tedious, but is nonetheless fairly useful.","Reasonably interesting!","Not too painful, probably worth taking for the experience.","Your TV will make or break your experience; find a good one early on.","This is a good foundational course in economics.","This class is what you make of it. I have heard all levels of praise and criticism for this class and I honestly think it's because your experience in the class really depends on how much effort you put into it. For example, with the problem sets, really try to figure things out yourself. But if you come across a concept you just don't understand, go to office hours!!!! This is key. I honestly do not know how I could have understood some of the problem sets if I had not gone to David Johnson's office hours. Unfortunately, David Johnson won't be returning as Head TF next year, but nevertheless you should always seek help. The resources are there if you are willing to take advantage of them.","Greg Mankiw is the chillest dude of all time. This class will open your mind.","It is a really good class, only reservation is that your section leaders can really impact how much you learn. Go to Johnson's office hours and make sure to take the unit tests.","Be prepared, lots of reading","The tests and Psets are well written but the sections and the way the course is taught, from a textbook is not the most engaging or genuinely interesting way","This is a great course to learn the basics of economics.","If you want to do well in the exams, it would require most of your own initiative by studying the helpful hints and going to office hours.","Studying for tests doesn't seem to help grades as much as it should.","This class is a good introduction to economics. it is helpful is you have a background in economics first though. Make sure you ask a lot of questions and do practice questions!!","David Johnson is awesome! Unfortunately he'll be gone by the time next year's students come around, but nonetheless this course is one of the best and most enriching ones I've taken so far at Harvard.","Ec 10a is a great course.  The sections reinforced what we learned on our own from the textbook.  The greatest strengths of this course were the psets and mid-term review materials.  I now feel I have a strong foundation in micro-economics and a new way to look at many current domestic issues.","If you take this class, get ready to put in work! This class can come with frustrations and I recommend that you do not take it with two problem-set classes. Go to section, ask multiple TFs for help (not just yours), work on it with friends, read\/skim the textbook, read study guides, take advantage of the helpful hints... JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO EVERYTHING TO NOT FALL BEHIND IN THIS COURSE! Because the process of catching up is not fun.","This class is taught very effectively and efficiently, and if the resources that this course provides are taken full advantage of, then a student will have a great understanding of microeconomics when the course terminates.","Even though I took it because it is a requirement for economics concentrators, I would definitely recommend it as an elective or for Gen Ed credit. It's a really good class to get a thorough understanding of the basis of economics. It also gives you a different way of thinking about the world.","This course is a very good entry into economics to see if you like the subject and wish to pursue it","it is very annoying and difficult but it is worth it if you have a passion for economics","Don't take this class if you are interested in Mankiw; he won't really be there. Take this class if you're interested in economics.","This class might not be the most exciting course at Harvard, but it does build a strong foundation of basic economics knowledge. I feel that I am prepared to pursue future studies in the subject.","It might seem easy in the beginning but make sure you keep paying attention because it gets significantly harder. Also, go to the unit tests. Even if you don't know anything, going over them is really helpful and will help prepare you for the exams. Read the book, it makes things so much easier.","It was a very interesting and enjoyable class and a great introduction to microeconomics","Taking this course is a great way to find out if you are interested in economics. If you have taken AP Economics in high school, most of the material in this course will be a review, but I still recommend taking it because of the emphasis that this course places on math rather than on concepts.","This course is great! Alot of work definitely but worth it.","It's a pretty good class. Not fantastic. It's very dumbed down, but that's necessary for an introductory course. Get started on your psets early in the week (i.e. not before Thursday night) or else you'll drown.","Do the unit tests, they really help you make sure you understand the material and stay on top of things. Plus the extra grade boost is nice. One nice part about the psets is that there are always a bunch of people working on them so you always have friends you can ask. Don't work on psets alone!! Friends make it easier and more fun.","If you are interested in the material, it is a great course to take. It will also be useful in the future, so it's never a bad decision. However if you know you don't want to concentrate in economics, it might not be the best choice.","Go to office hours!!!!!","It's a great course! It is not easy but you learn so much. Economics is important for everyone to study because it is very practical and applicable to everyone's life. It is true, you will probably not see Professor Mankiw often but that's certainly not a negative. Economics really should be taught in small sections because of the nature of the material. Also the guest lectures introduce really interesting more advanced economic topics which helps to put the basics into perspective. This class is definitely worth the work!","Having a good TF will influence greatly how interested you will be in the subject. With head TF David Johnson leaving next year, one might be more wary as to how the course will be.","Mankiw is a character.  If anything, take the course for him.  Entertaining and informative.","Solid introductory economics class that's light on lectures, heavy on sections.","Take this course to have a better understanding of the world and why it works the way that it does.","I would definitely recommend that you take this course. It's essential that you learn these theories not for only the class but also for your practical life.","You learn valuable information in this course, but the exams are very difficult.","The material is pretty boring, but you'll feel better about your understanding of the world when it's all over. Don't bother with the textbook, just pay attention in section, go to the course-wide reviews, and watch the occasional YouTube clip if you don't get it. Work with a partner.","Not a class you can just blow off, particularly if you have never had previous experience with ec before. Not an easy gened!","Taking this course has proved to be the best decision I've made this year.  Basic economic knowledge is essential to understanding how society works and how to make society better.  I had no experience in economics before this class, but now Economics is my number one concentration option.","While this class is a great one to take as a freshman due to it's introductory approach to the concepts of economics and the manageable workload, I would caution that anyone without any prior knowledge of economics may find themselves struggling slightly.","This course is wonderful as long as you have a TF who is enthusiastic and knowledgable about the course material.","If you are interested in economics as a potential concentration, take this.  If you are interested in economics more generally (i.e. want to be more economically literate), consider taking this.  Otherwise...not really a \"fun\" class.","Go to office hours if you're confused.","If you have any interest in economics, you'll love this course.","It is a solid class and teaches a great basis of economic theory.","make sure to get help from your TF if you've never taken econ before","Although this class sometimes gets a bad name, I found it to be one of the most enlightening experiences I have had during my three years at Harvard so far.","TF quality varies wildly.","Very interesting, but somewhat difficult because of the teaching style. Make sure you go to office hours.","Worth the work","I enjoyed it, and it will definitely tell you if economics is the field for you.","don't take it unless you need to","This is a good class to take, regardless if you're planning to concentrate in Economics, since it touches on many microeconomic concepts that are ubiquitous in today's news and debates.","This is a good class to take for anyone who is interested in Economics, but most of the lectures and the sections don't provide any additional information on what can be found in Mankiw book.","As long as you stay on top of your time management and understanding of what is being taught, this class is an incredibly interesting and rewarding class to take.","It seems like there are two kinds of people who take this class: the ones who find the problem sets difficult but manageable and fun to figure out, and the ones who find the problem sets grueling and the low point of their weeks. This class is I think very necessary in that the general microeconomics principles can be widely applied. However, your enjoyment of the class depends very much upon the quality of your section leader because they are the ones who do the majority of teaching (Mankiw only gives five or six lectures over the course of the semester). For me, all the concepts of the course didn't completely come together until I began studying for the final, mostly because I went to other section leaders as well as because I finally had to break down and teach myself the skills I didn't understand from the section. My advice to anyone who takes this course is to really jump in to it: go to David Johnson's office hours (!!!) and the review sessions of other TFs as well as any office hours you have access to. I found this course incredibly grueling, but if I had employed the same tactics all semester that I did in preparation for the final I think I would have had a greater appreciation for the course.","I hope Economics is not about Ec10","Honestly the experience really varies with the TF you get. I'd recommend talking to your friends and trying to get a TF they recommend because some of them are just straight awful from what I've heard.","You're probably going to have to take this class to fulfill a requirement. It's tough that the course depends so heavily on the quality of your TF, but you'll at least learn something from it by the end. Not sure how it'll go without David Johnson though.","It's a grind but it will inform the way you think about the world.","The class is certainly useful for understanding basic economic principles that will be useful for all students regardless of their future occupations.","It's a challenging class but has the unique property of being useful in the understanding of every day life.","Economics is a vast and fascinating field, and this course introduces you to many important concepts. However, since the class is so huge, it often feels impersonal and somewhat rushed. You learn mostly from Unit tests and P-sets, which can be very time consuming.","It makes you think in a different and useful way that will be helpful to your future and present life.","Ec 10 is a classic huge course. The material is basic, with limited engagement from faculty and a disconnected feel. Your satisfaction in this course is entirely dependent upon who your section leader is and whether or not you're actually interested in any of the material being covered. Even if you feel like you have a great grasp of the material and kill it on the problem sets, you may be set up for disappointment on the exams. Standards are vague and inconsistent.","If you haven't taken ec before, you'll learn a lot.  Make sure you get a good section TF or switch sections until you do, it'll make a huge difference.  The curve is super nice- do average on the exams and take the Unit Tests and you'll get an A-.","It's a worthwhile course.  You have to take the initiative to go to OH and take unit tests if you (1) have a poor TF and (2) want to do well in the course.","Not very hard to get a good grade if you do the work. The material is all basically intuitive.","If you take one class at Harvard, this should be it. A basic understanding of economics is the obligation of every participating citizen in this country.","Take this class if you are prepared to think independently about the information presented and not to accept every theory as fact. Also, the work load is very manageable.","This course isn't that interesting, but it is necessary to have an understanding of the fundamental concepts in economics before one goes on to higher-level courses.","This class sucks. The section leaders for the most part aren't able to teach. Mankiw is snobby and racist and teh guest lecturers were no better.","Highly dependent on TF quality (I was lucky, but from what I've heard from others).","many people just have to take ec to get a secondary or concentrate in it. If you are not doing one of those two do not take it","This course build good foundations to do basically anything in any field.","I would tell them that this course to take to be a well informed citizen and not be ignorant of important issues that are heavily related to the field of economics.","Try to stay on top of your work, if you get behind you will have trouble","Very useful foundational course.","They try their best to make introductory economics not mundane.","Be careful before you enroll in this course. Everyone is taking it, but that does NOT mean you should. If you have a bad TF (like I did) then you will struggle with the exams. This may not be because you don't understand the material, but rather is a result of the fact that the exams are designed to be tricky. Without helpful hints from a TF you will likely struggle.","Very bread-and-butter intro economics class. Makes you feel like you're in a large public school with huge lecturers and half the school taking the course. But you learn what's necessary.","It's a pretty interesting class. If you are interested in concentrating in economics, you'll have to take it anyway.","Take this class or you're not an informed citizen.","The average grade in this class is a B+; that does not make this class an easy one by any means.","The experience is definitely what you make it. It depends on your TF, your willingness to engage in participations and attend lectures and above all, to GO TO DAVID JOHNSTON'S OFFICE HOURS! (HINT: everyone should definitely do it!)","This course can be helpful to develop economic literacy which can ultimately shift the way you look at the world. However, you should take this course seriously and complete the readings. You get as much out of Ec10 as you put in.","Take Ec10a! Ec 10a is difficult, but well worth it because the class gives you some critical life skills and information. How much you get out of section depends on how competent your TF is, but it is still possible to do well without a good TF if you spend a lot of time outside of class going over concepts. You'll be in a better position if you've had some preview of microeconomics before taking the class.","Much of Ec10's successes or failures come from the ability of your TF.  I was fortunate enough to have a spectacular TF, which means I had a spectacular experience.  At the same time, however, some of my roommates had TFs that were not as great, and they did not have as great an experience as I did.  If all TFs were at the same level, I would have no issue recommending with enthusiasm.  The course is a great introduction to economics for those without a prior background, and I had a great time learning about it.","It's useful, no doubt, but in the same way that eating spinach and broccoli is useful when you're growing up: in hindsight, you're glad you got that fiber, but it could've been shoved down your throat in a much more palatable way.","This isn't an \"easy\" class, but if you put the time in it can be very rewarding.","Interesting material. There's definitely a conservative spin on some of the material, but take it with a grain of salt and remember that it's just the most basic principles and ignores many of the real-world issues. Mathematical sophistication is basically non-existent, and if you've taken calculus before you'll likely be hitting yourself over the head by how simple the math is. Psets are by far the most difficult part of the class. The only thing you should watch out for is that exams will have questions about the most random facts from lecture so be prepared for that.","Attend all of David Johnson's office hours.","If you get basic math and have some common sense, you'll be fine. Just do the readings and stay on top of it and you'll cruise.","Even if you're not planning to do anything related to econ, this is a valuable course to take because of how applicable it is to daily life. The material is quite interesting, and it pushes you to look at the world through a different lens, which I personally found exciting. The problem sets can sometimes be quite a bit of work, but it helps to work with people.","The experience you have depends greatly on your TF. It is a great way to learn the basics.","Pay attention to lectures.","It's a great class. I had a great section TF, so I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Lectures vary between being very interesting and quite dull. You won't get taught by Mankiw other than about 4 lectures.","Ec10 is an interesting class. If you are looking to understand the math behind economics, then this is not the class for you.","Unless you are taking this class to fulfill a concentration requirement I would avoid it. It is a solid introduction into the material but i would not describe it as the most fulfilling class.","study lectures, but you don't really need to go","take it if want to do ec","It's not that interesting a topic in general but it does provide the necessary background to go on in economics i think.","Take this class but be ready to put more time and effort than is asked of you into it if you want to be successful.","I could not imagine a more poorly taught course. Section is a complete waste. The material from the book is recited in the same way it was presented originally. Take it if you have to.","As a liberal, did not enjoy the abundance of conservative philosophy embedded in the course or Mankiw himself. I did learn a lot though.","I would highly recommend this course to all students. This course significantly raised my understanding of the world around me and gave me specific tools for analysis. I now have better knowledge to tackle the news and current events with and have applied the fundamentals of economics in all of my other classes this semester across various disciplines. Although this class is not extremely difficult, it does require lots of time, thought, and energy. Problem sets and unit tests are key for comprehension and thus need to be taken seriously.","There is a reason that this course is the most widely attended course at Harvard. The material does the job, though you could likely learn it through the text book rather than in class. Either way, I recommend taking the course and attending the lectures to gain from the material."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"711","response rate":"85.65","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 10a","course_id":"930","cat_num":"3660","1s":"19","2s":"74","3s":"241","4s":"187","5s":"70"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 10a","course_id":"930","cat_num":"3660","1s":"3","2s":"30","3s":"244","4s":"148","5s":"28"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 10a","course_id":"930","cat_num":"3660","1s":"11","2s":"291","3s":"184","4s":"20","5s":"19"}},"success":true}
