I think that he has a multivalent way of looking at objects--something that appeals to students in many fields.","Go to lecture - it is worth it.","-the course was engaging\r\n-the concepts were challenging\r\n-the professor was stimulating, fascinating\r\n-the material was unbelievable\r\n-it was a rewarding experience","It's a shame that more people don't know about the fascinating pre-Columbian cultures of the Americas.  We know everything about European art history, but so little about non-\"Western\" traditions.  It's not just cave-man stuff, or human sacrifice.  These were very interesting, complex cultures with amazing creative scope.  So... take the class, and enjoy it."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Painless course! Lectures tend to wander a little, reading's too extensive and not all need to be read, sometimes ideas are a little hard to grasp.","It is a very interesting subject, however, the lecture component of the class is very disorganized, so be prepared.","a lot of reading but worth it!","This class is really great if you\u00c2\u00b4re into both anthropology and art history, it's an interesting mix of both.  It might not be the ideal class for someone who's just taking one art history class to try out the department, but for someone who really enjoys art history or is a concentrator it's worth it.","The content is interesting as are the lectures, but there is an overwhelming amount of reading.","This class is very interesting and a fascinating non-Western course option, so you are introduced to societies whose artistic production is integral to the functioning of their political and social systems. It's a fantastic choice if you sometimes feel that art can get too removed from most of the population and interacts only with an intellectual elite. There is a ridiculous amount of readings, but generally you can skim them and should make sure to form study groups for exams (and shouldn't let the number of readings keep you from taking the course).","Professor Cummins is a very enthusiastic lecturer, and the opportunity to handle artifacts in section is great. I found the lectures at the beginning somewhat hard to follow though--you might want to go in with a basic understanding of Aztec history and religion to avoid confusion. Also, you might want to reconsider if you're just taking the class out of a vague sense that it might awaken some interest in you, like I did; it covers the material in a lot of depth for someone who does not have a specific interest in it.","Prof. Cummins has organized stunning lectures and he will amaze you with the insight he has into the material.  This is the kind of course for which one comes to Harvard.","It's very interesting, but be sure you can attend all of the lectures","Great class. Very interesting and low workload","This course is a great introduction to the art and architecture of two fascinating cultures.  Cummins is incredibly knowledgeable in his field, and generates a real enthusiasm for the material.  Sections working with the Peabody Museum collection are a huge bonus.  Stay on top of your reading if you can, because you will get more out of the class if you do.","It is a very interesting class for people interested in pre-colombian cultures or art and architecture. Probably a good was to satisfy Lit B requirement","There is an unbelievable amount of reading required for this course.","Cummins really know his stuff and I find that the subject matter is very interesting. If you are not fully interested then maybe it could become boring but if you are then it's a lot of fun.","Great way to fulfill non-Western art history course requirement.","Professor Cummins is one of the best lecturers in HAA, and I thoroughly recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject matter.","Very interesting!  Loved the lectures","It's interesting but they could do a better job with making the subject matter more appealing.","This class is really fascinating and has a good balance of work.  For HAA concentrators or secondary field concentrators, it is an awesome way to fulfill upper level and\/or period requirements.","Probably the worst class I have taken at Harvard.","If you want to remember one class ten years after graduating, this will be it.","I would highly recommend this course. The subject matter is a little bit esoteric and probably not appealing to most, but the class really incorporates ways of looking at and thinking about the objects and cultures presented that are profound and interesting, mainly because they are so different from modern cultures (and interpretations). The reading load is heavy.","This class offers a valuable opportunity to closely study the art of two great empires whose artistic achievements are often overlooked or underrated. The teaching staff is good and you'll get exposure, both in lecture slides and through firsthand access in section, to some great works of art.","If you;re interested in the Inca or the Aztec, this can be a fun course. Sections are very cool; they're in the Peabody Museum and you get to see so many cool originals, like quipus and old manuscripts housed in the Tozzer. Lectures can drag on, and far more readings are assigned than necessary, but these are small prices to pay for the knowledge you gain and the excellent experience in section, as well as the chance to hear a renowned scholar speak twice a week.","I would recommend taking it Pass\/Fail if you aren't an HAA concentrator.  Inca and Aztec art is really interesting but there is a lot to learn if you are just taking it as an elective."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["You will learn a lot. Cummins is very approachable and enthusiastic about the course. Aztec and Incan art will force you to see and think in different ways (especially for those who focus on Western art). It's entirely new and a very exciting field!","If you do your work, you'll be completely fine regardless of background knowledge on the subject. Lectures are enjoyable; Tom is quite funny and lively - a happy energy. Class can be a bit boring if sections fail to generate enthusiasm.","You learn so much! The lectures are a little disorganized, but it didn't get in my way much","I adored this class! Professor Cummins is so engaging in lecture. His clear love for the material is contagious! I looked forward to going to lecture every Tuesday and Thursday, I would really recommend this class to anyone, its a great way to get out of the western bubble of art and architecture!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"16","response rate":"93.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 197","course_id":"2593","cat_num":"9976","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 197","course_id":"2593","cat_num":"9976","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"12","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 197","course_id":"2593","cat_num":"9976","1s":"3","2s":"11","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
