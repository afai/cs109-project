'07":{"comments":["Take this course! It just might take over your life but you'll have a blast and learn Russian faster than you thought possible.","If you want to learn Russian, take this course.  You will learn Russian.  \r\nYou will also work very hard and find it very difficult at times, especially if you have no previous experience with a Slavic language.  Do not take this course if you cannot invest a significant amount of time into it.  If you have the time and you truly want to learn Russian, it's worth it.","Intensive Russian was an amazing experience. It was definitely hard and a lot of work, but it was worth every moment to have such a thorough sense of the language and culture so deeply ingrained in such a fun way.","It's a big committment but very rewarding if you are dedicated to it."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["If you are a serious about considering the study of Slavic languages and literature, do not make the same mistake I did. Russian is extremely well structured and allows the students to progress to high levels given commitment.  The other languages in the department fall apart after first year instruction.  Take Russian, and if other Slavic languages interest you, THEN take those and not the other way around.","Prepare yourself for hearing \"that's intense\" every time you tell someone that you are taking the course, and for thinking \"no, not intense, intensIVE,\" but not saying it.","I would tell future students that the class is difficult but rewarding.  I would suggest they take this course over 2 semesters, not as an intensive class.","Be prepared to work a lot! If the student is willing to, they will learn a lot of Russian quickly.","This is a wonderful course but very difficult. If you are willing to spend the hours necessary you will come out very impressed with what you have been able to learn. As a warning, do not underestimate the amount of time you will have to spend - there is no way to skimp on the work."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["This class is fricking fantastic.","It is the best way to acquire a fair amount of Russian quickly.","The intensity is actually quite helpful because it pushes you to do everything on time and keep reviewing grammar & vocabulary--you do not want to fall behind.","Don't be intimidated by all the stigma surrounding intensive courses! It's great if you apply yourself."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It can be a great class or a hellish class. It's what you make of it. Just remember to work constantly and really hard from the beginning to avoid falling behind.","I would tell fellow graduate students that it is a great opportunity to learn a new language quickly (especially the grammar building blocks). However is next to impossible to commit the appropriate time and therefore it can be very frusturating.","This class was taught in a relaxed setting but was still taught very well.","The best language class I've ever taken. A lot of fun.","Probably the best language course I've taken at Harvard"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This course is the single most effective way to gain a basic command of the Russian language in the shortest amount of time possible. I believe that after this course it is perfectly possible to go to Russia and find your way speaking only in Russian.","A great way to learn a lot of Russian in a short period of time. Be ready to do a lot of work though."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["It's a lot of work, but seeing youself make progress so rapidly is more than worth it","You should be excellent at languages and be prepared for this to be your primary concentration for the semester. Its really hard - but worth it.","Take this class.  It is definitely a commitment but the teaching staff is wonderful and you will come away with a real knowledge of Russian.  The class dynamic is genuinely enjoyable and I ended up making some great friends on this whirlwind journey through another language and culture.  It can be scary at first, but it was truly one of the most rewarding experiences I've had so far at Harvard. Go for it!!!","As is often said of this course in evaluations past; this class is entirely what you make of it.  It requires a lot of drive, but the pay off is enormous and both the teaching staff and the fellow students were always supportive, helpful and made the experience unforgettable and--dare one say it--fun!","This is a great class for anyone that is committed to or even very intrigued by the prospect of learning a new language. If you are not willing to be serious about it then don't take the class.","You will learn so much, so quickly.  You won't be fluent by the end, but even going in with absolutely no Russian background, I gained so much from the class.  It's a lot of time in class, but totally worth it."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This course was awesome! Though Intensive Russian might seem like a hard course based on the name, the teaching staff is really supportive and makes the workload completely manageable. Feeback is timely and useful.","I can't express how happy I am that I took Slavic Aab. Being a first semester freshman I was nervous to take an intensive language course, but it turned out to be a great decision: because it counts as 2 half courses I only had two other courses this semester. Although the work load is heavy, it is so rewarding: in only a few months I could already make conversation, understand my professors, write, and read in Russian, coming in with absolutely no knowledge of the language. For anyone who wants to take a class that will expand their knowledge very quickly, whether it is for speaking or reading ability, I would highly recommend the course. Just make sure you are willing to put in a lot of class hours (8 a week) and stay up to date on homework, because missing a day of class can put you behind immediately. But Nataliya did a great job teaching the grammar, and Natalia Georgievna was so much fun to learn with during conversation-- they both helped us learn this language faster than any of us thought possible.","Be prepared for a very large amount of work. It's difficult to take this class with any other challenging course because in order to get the most out of a language class like this one you really have to devote yourself to it and make sure to do every single piece of assigned work with care. However, that said, I cannot imagine a more fulfilling class. I've learned more in one semester than I did in 6 years of high school language at a very high level. The amount you take away from this class makes it more than worth the work and teaching is incredible.","It's an intensive language class; prepare for intensity.","only take the intensive course if you have time to do homework every night of the week","It is a lot of work, so you have to want to learn Russian."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It is overwhelming at the beginning, and you have ot be ready to dedicate yourself fully to this. A lot of students drop out during the first weeks because they werent ready. Make sure that you will be able to attend class every day, or at least, not to miss to many days in a row.","This course is a fantastic introduction to the Russian language and culture. Its intensity should not scare you, because in the end the hard work certainly pays off. The instructors are very approachable, helpful and tolerant, and they try to accommodate everything according to your learning needs. It is possibly the best way to learn this language: I, myself, believe that I would not have been able to fully grasp the foundations of Russian without ever taking this course.","Take this class if you want to feel confident in your speaking abilities after just one semester. I feel that we speak more confidently than even the students who took the Slavic A full year course. That being said, this course requires a lot of work each week (before tests up 5 or 6 hours at least in the beginning). Tests are almost always on Tuesdays, so make sure your Sundays and especially Monday evenings aren't too jammed up with other work.","This class is VERY VERY DIFFICULT. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU CANNOT SPEND APP.  15 HOURS OR MORE EVERY WEEK. That being said the learning experienced cannot be matched with anything else. You get to cover material equivalent to a full year in Russian.","Fantastic course!","Definitely one of my favorite courses.  I have been recommending it already to my friends here at MIT!  With the amount of material translated into English and the abundance of media that is produced inside the United States alone, one doesn't realize the richness and abundance of those produced in foreign countries and not translated.  However, one loses so much is lost when translating anything.  Learning Russian gives one access to a fortune of information and culture that would otherwise be inaccessible.\r\n\r\nAs to the weight of the class, I feel that the intensity of the course made it that much more enjoyable.  I really bonded with my classmates, and there wasn't a single boring second (particularly with Natalia Chirkov's enthusiasm!)","This was a great class and the teachers were really great."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["If you do all the work, you'll have no trouble in this class--just don't slack off.","This class is intense (as per the label) but amazing!  Natalia Georgievna is the most fantastic teacher you will ever find, and Philipp was also excellent.  They want you to succeed and will go to great lengths to help you.  But you need to be dedicated to learning Russian, engaged, and willing to put in hard work."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you want to begin learning Russian - a pretty big if - this is a great way to do it. The benefit of the additional class time versus the year-long course is significant, and I learned a phenomenal amount in a short time.","Only take this class if you are passionate about the subject because it is a huge commitment.","If you are serious about learning Russian, take this course. Seriously, it is by far the best course I have taken ever. I feel that I learned so much and was able to fully enjoy everything. Yes, it is every day. Yes, it is at 9AM and sometimes you're going to want to die getting up in the morning. But it is definitely definitely worth it. When compared to the students in the regular course, we seem to have advanced by leaps and bounds. There is no comparison. The fast pace is definitely the strength of the course because your brain is tricked into just accepting things and the constant exposure definitely helps one adjust to pronunciation, pick up vocabulary, and learn how to produce cogent sentences.","The course is very intensive and demands a significant time commitment--Slavic A might be a better option unless you have a particular reason for requiring a rapid acquisition of Russian."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Take this class if you are seriously interested in learning to speak, write, and read Russian. It is going to be tough getting up every weekday morning to come to class, and it will be tough to do all the assignments and spend so much time on this class, but it will be so worth it. The professor is amazing and at the end of the course, you will be able to speak, read, and write Russian. I definitely felt like I maximized my Harvard undergrad academic experience by taking this class.","This course is challenging, but the teachers are wonderful and the sheer amount of time a week you spend on it means that it's much easier to internalize the language. You go through most of the grammatical structures in the language, so that you get a map of the Russian language that will (I'm told) be filled in in course B. I strongly recommend it.","This course is demanding, rewarding, and fun. I always looked forward to conversation section in particular. Natalia Chirkov is a master teacher. Expect to spend a lot of time on class and homework, but also expect to get a lot out of it. If you are serious about this course, you will learn a great deal of Russian in a single semester."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you have any interest in Russian, this is a great course. Don't be fooled by the 9 AM, five days per week schedule -- it gets you into a good routine and is a fantastic way to start the day. You learn a great deal very quickly; classes are fun, small, and always interesting. Be aware that the first few weeks might seem overwhelming, but you will soon find yourself completing homework much more quickly."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A great class--hard to believe how much one can learn in just one semester!","This class doesn't require a background in Russian\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut it does require a lot of motivation, and the discipline to follow with one of the fastest moving courses I've encountered. But there's no teacher more equipped to help you learn Russian than Natalia Georgievna, who is spectacularly effective and encouraging. Definitely the best learning experience I have had at Harvard, or ever.","The course is out of this world. Natalia Georgievna is the most fabulous instructor I have had. \n\nA few things you would want to know: the course will take a lot of time and commitment, so you will want to have that time and interest in learning Russian. If you have both, taking the class will be the best thing you did.  \n\nThe course has an emphasis on grammar and exposes a wealth of information in an extremely clear fashion. This is invaluable as a basis to build vocabulary on, so I felt the course mentality was right on. The material is great and very original; I've never seen course materials quite like it.\n\nAlso the course has (in addition to the morning sessions) a speaking session three times a week: they are so well taught, and make the course truly special.\n\nRussian is a hard language: the grammar is tough, and getting to make it spontaneous enough for oral is difficult. Be prepared for a challenge; I will not hide that having a previous exposure does help.\n\nBut overall if you want to go through the experience, I greatly recommend the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"9.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RUSS Aab","course_id":"4519","cat_num":"4441","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RUSS Aab","course_id":"4519","cat_num":"4441","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RUSS Aab","course_id":"4519","cat_num":"4441","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
