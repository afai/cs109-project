learn a lot in this course, but you won't be able to speak to Japanese people very effectively. This class teaches you grammar, but you need to learn the rest of the useful stuff on your own.","The atmosphere is very unique, supportive, and fun","If you really like Japanese, want to improve your grammar, and learn how to speak in formal\/public settings I highly recommend this class. The teachers are very enthusiastic and willing to help.","If you don't keep up with the material for even a couple of days, you're screwed.","Make sure you work hard because if you do, it will be really enjoyable.","if you want to learn japanese.","It's a great class, but be prepared to learn a whole lot. The more experience you have coming in, the better. Don't be afraid to take a level lower than you may think you are at, because this will really strengthen your fundamentals. Also, the grading is pretty easy, so you don't need to sweat the work and tests as much as you may think.","you work hard, but have fuuunn too!"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["If you want to take Japanese at Harvard, there are no other options.","Second year Japanese is extremely difficult (and it's worth noting that I say this as someone doing relatively well in the class, who already knows an Asian language. It's not just hard for people who are bad at languages\/don't work hard at learning them). I took Ba\/Bb over the summer, and even though that meant doing a whole year's worth of material in 7 weeks, it was still far easier than a semester of Japanese 120. Because of that, unless you are required to take it, or are really, really into Japanese, it's worth reconsidering whether you really want to take it on. You'll spend a lot of time feeling frustrated and every time you open your mouth it seems like you make multiple mistakes. I assume at some point in the future I'll actually feel like I have some grasp of the language, but right now, I really don't.","Please don't take this class.","Short story: don't take this class if Matsumoto is teaching it.\r\n\r\nLonger story: Before I took this class, I was set to spend 1 class EACH semester my Junior AND Senior year working hard and learning Japanese. Then I took this class and am never continuing with Japanese here at Harvard again. I don't care about not getting this citation any more, because I am positive I will have a much better time learning this on my own. I hated this class not for how difficult it is - (yes it's much more difficult than Ba\/BB, and I am from a Chinese background), but for how stressed and frustrated I was, trying for the whole semester to have fun in class while struggling to learn more efficiently, and especially for trying to connect with the sensei - only to get the impression on the last Monday of the semester that the main sensei, Matsumoto, could really care less about our experience as students in this class. If you have the summer to spare, go to Japan, take 2nd year Japanese, and return to take Japanese 130. I've been told by trustworthy sources that it's \"MUCH better\" - in general, for your personal health, (stress level, etc), and your grade.\r\n\r\nI look forward to taking all those other excellent classes that I would have missed out on, such as Business Chinese, and maybe even beginning French.","This class, while necessary for your continuation of the study of Japanese language, is extremely difficult. Mentally prepare yourself. You need to study and reinforce material a lot in order to succeed. That said, the instructors are very willing to help if you approach them.","This is a bad class for some.  Good class for others.  It depends on how much you are willing and able to work, because this class will EAT UP YOUR TIME.  If you are taking another difficult class, I seriously discourage you from taking this course.  But if you are genuinely interested in learning a lot of Japanese, and putting A LOT of work into doing that, then this is a good course.","Be prepared to work very very hard.","It's a lot of work, but you learn a lot.","If one is not truly invested in learning the class I would not recommend it at all. Similar to classes such as Chem 30, CS50 and other time intensive classes, one must be ready to invest a lot of time in order to fully master the material.","This class is very difficult if you have had no experience with Japanese outside of Japanese Ba\/Bb. Because of the pace of the class and the ease with which you can make mistakes on kanji, vocab, and grammar, it can sometimes be discouraging to spend five hours memorizing things only to get a full point out of 15 off for drawing one of the lines in a kanji too long. You will learn a lot though, and the expectations may be high, but they are clear.","Be aware. This is a very frustrating class. Speak with those who took it previously beforehand.","You can definitely learn Japanese, but be prepared to work at it. This isn't like Japanese Ba\/Bb but you will feel satisfied at the end knowing how much work you've done. But you will need to spend a lot of time on this class, both for required work and for personal practice.","If you want an A, this course will require nothing less than full, unreserved commitment.","Japanese is difficult, but it doesn't need to be miserable. Only the class itself has the power to make us actually feel BAD about ourselves. Japanese is simply hard work and hard work can, as Japanese Ba\/Bb showed, can be fun. Frankly, I'm a little shocked that this course has Japanese Ba\/Bb to compare itself to and that still, the professor doesn't seem at all embarrassed about just how greatly her course falls short compared to Ba\/Bb's success. It's not simply, as the professor's say, that second year Japanese is hard. Japanese is always hard. It's actually the concrete way that this course is run on a day-to-day basis that is failing and these are all things that can be improved before the course is offered again."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["It is a lot of doable work; the will to really learn the language just has to be there.","I have taken several Japanese courses in different institutions abroad (including in Japan).\r\nThe course is by far the best I have taken so far. The work teachers put on here is just huge and you can see it. \r\nIf your purpose is to reach a significant level in Japanese (not just to be able to order sushis in Japanese when you go visit Tokyo...) this course is what you need.","This is a very well taught class. You learn a lot of kanji, vocab, and grammar. By the end of the class I felt that my Japanese language skills had greatly improved. Both teachers are great. \r\nHomework takes a long time, and you have work every night. I usually allowed myself an hour to two and a half hours for homework and studying every night.","The best, though most challenging, language course I have ever taken.","If you don't have extensive experience in Japanese this is not the class for you. Japanese Bb wouldn't adequately prepare.","Unless this course slows down and is clearer in how it is taught (i.e. EVERYTHING is taught in Japanese -- even office hours -- and you have to figure out the concepts on your own), be prepared to spend a lot of time on your own trying to navigate through this course. It is taught at an incredibly fast pace so do your best to not get lost from the get-go. It is also an INCREDIBLE amount of work but the workload won't be your biggest worry -- it's how lost you'll feel in the class everyday if you don't diligently figure out the concepts on your own.","It's a lot harder than Japanese Ba\/Bb but as long as you stay on top of the material (just reviewing it before, after class) it isn't too much of a challenge.  Grading tends to be more nit-picky though so be careful to check for mistakes on homework, etc.","Shingu-sensei was the new instructor for Japanese 120a this year, and was absolutely wonderful! She was extremely patient and encouraging, and always open to answering any questions we had about the material. Masumoto-sensei was in charge of our drill sections, and helped us improve our speaking skills in all sorts of different situations (talking to friends using casual speech, co-workers using formal, and superiors with polite). \r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the small section sizes (there were at most 10 people at any given section) because it gave us a chance to get to know our classmates better. The extra course materials (there were readings for each chapter after the chapter quiz, and dialogues for listening practice) were also very helpful for reinforcing the grammar we went over in class. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, 120a was taught at a very manageable pace, but it is important to keep on top of the material. Since it's a language class, the drill sections will build on top of each other, so falling behind would probably make it difficult to keep up. I would highly recommend this class! It's a ton of fun, and you learn an incredible amount!","I would not advise taking this class unless you are required to, or are extremely devoted to learning Japanese.  The class has a huge amount of work that will eat up a lot of your time if you hope to do modestly well."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is very tense and moves at a fast pace but the results are rewarding - you feel like you learn a lot and I genuinely feel like my Japanese skills have improved.","If one can finish all the preparations for each class beforehand, then the class is easy to follow.","A big step up from Bb","Shingu-sensei is hilarious and after this semester, I feel like my Japanese comprehension and production skills has improved ten-fold. It may be difficult, but the quick speed of both the class and speech has definitely played a large role in my improvement. Definitely take this course.","Have a good sense of humor and don't get discourage with grammar!","I LOVED this class. It was way more difficult than the beginner level course, and the work seemed outrageous at times, but the amount I have earned is colossal. Shingu-sensei and Mori-sensei were exceptional throughout the class in teaching, providing feedback, and making the course enjoyable. If you're not on top of things, this course can very easily be the one you dread the most all semester, but being prepared and knowing the material makes it one of the best. I highly recommend this course to anyone very strongly interested in continuing their study of Japanese but please, take it seriously. Also be sure you're prepared to shell out the money for Nakama 2.","This class is not easy. If you were really good in Ba and Bb you'll probably be fine. If you were so so in Ba and Bb, then you're gonna need to put in a lot of effort. You learn a lot and the course itself is fair. But I would say spend the summer before you take this course in Japan practicing.","It is ridiculously hard, be prepared tow irk","Honestly I can't stress enough how great of a class it is, so more helpful for you would be if I told you what I liked least. Shingu sensei is an absolutely amazing professor who's passionate about what she does...she also speaks like a bullet! That's good and bad. It's good because it trains your listening comprehension extremely well. It's bad for a lot more reasons that it's good. First of all, I and other students have found that it makes sitting in class a bit uncomfortable. While the high energy is nice, when she speaks so fast it really makes you nervous. It puts you in this state of constant uneasiness because she could call on you at any second and you probably won't have understood what she said. I mean, you can get over that, but what was really unfortunate is that Shingu Sensei performs the scripts she uses for the listening comprehension section of tests, which I found to be a bit unfair. There's absolutely nothing wrong with speaking fast, but I feel that if you're going to test a group of beginners on a foreign language that it's unfair to speak so fast for the listening comprehension sections on tests as it makes it extremely difficult to do well on the chapter quizzes, midterm, and final. The same applies for the oral interview. Interviewing with Shingu sensei is a bit difficult because the high speed makes you really uncomfortable.  Also, even though Shingu sensei is SUPER nice, I found that I didn't seek her out as much after class as I did the TF because speaking with her always makes me nervous just because I can't keep up. It's odd, but I found that that was probably the low-point of an otherwise amazing class. Shingu sensei is super nice and the class wouldn't be the same without her.","Currently a very fast-paced and work-heavy course, often to its detriment. You will be hard-pressed to find better instructors than Shingu-sensei and Mori-sensei; they truly are the best. However, that quality is lost in the midst of a jam-packed schedule that leaves the instructors racing to teach everything listed in the syllabus.","Although this course requires dedication and consistent, daily study, you will learn a lot more than you did in two semesters of elementary Japanese. I feel very satisfied when I can understand snippets of dialogue in Japanese dramas, since those are usually in casual speech which you'll practice more of in this course.","This class is not a class you want as a fifth course or as an 'easy' course. There are a lot of assignments, from essays to homework to literally 3-4 quizzes or tests a week. You have to put in two to three hours a night to succeed in this course and probably go to office hours a few times during the semester as well. I did not feel that first year japanese alone was enough to support me in this course not because first year doesnt teach enough but because the class begins with a learning curve. definitely review grammar vocab and kanji before entering this course. despite all the work the teaching staff is great and will help you anyway you need","Good but tough. You'll learn a lot, but it'll take lots of effort."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Extremely well taught. I have also taken Chinese here at Harvard, but hands down Japanese is taught better.

But you learn a lot too!","This class is great, but pretty challenging. Meeting 5 days a week, you really don't get a break from Japanese till the semester is over. However, your Japanese will GREATLY improve by the end.","I loved this course. A lot. If you like the language, and care about the culture, and are willing to put the work in, it's fantastic. The teachers are supportive and the occasional confusion definitely bonds the students together.","There is a high workload and fast pace, but you will learn a lot and improve your Japanese immensely.","Demanding but rewarding. Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei put their hearts into the course, and it shows in the course material and assignment feedback. Be prepared to work hard and not fall behind, but this class will make your Japanese improve by a ridiculous amount!","This is simply an amazing course! Shingu-sensei and Nishimura-sensei are absolutely dedicated to teaching and are always ready to help. Even if you need help on something not directly related to a lesson, they're always available by email or at their office hours. I know I spent many of mine having discussions with them on various topics for the practice. It's a good amount of work, but totally worth it in the end. My Japanese has improved tremendously thanks to both of them!","A bigger time commitment than Jpn Bb\/Ba but do continue taking Japanese as you will improve so much.","Definitely take this course if you've already taken Ba and Bb. It is definitely much more difficult than Ba or Bb, but it's completely worth it and you'll learn so much more in 120 than you already did in B-levels.","This class helps you get a greater understanding of more complex grammar points. I feel that my speaking and writing capabilities definitely increased over the course of the semester. Be sure to review all Kanji learned!.","Second year may appear as a leap from first year in terms of difficulty. More efforts are expected.","Shingu sensei is great.
