I took this class because it seemed the most painless way to fulfill this Gen Ed category, but I ended up really enjoying it.  Definitely take it if you're looking for an easy, fun way to get a Gen Ed out of the way.","The concepts are fascinating, but don't mire you in impossibly cryptic equations or uninteresting mechanics. A look at some of the most interesting realities of astronomy. Kind of like watching NOVA, without the repeats.","Take this course!!","It is a great way to fulfill the Science of the Physical Universe requirement.","It's a typical easy Science Gen-ed. Your decision to take off should understand the tradeoff between how easy a class is and how boring it is. This class is easy, but unless you have a special fascination for astronomy, it will be boring.","Do the readings and watch the lecture videos when you need them for problem sets. This is a great way to get rid of your science-a core without taking a huge GPA hit.","This is a very interesting class and is not too difficult! You will learn a lot of fascinating material. In addition, you should take advantage of the opportunity to use the observatory in the science center. I highly recommend this course.","Super easy, super fun, super star professor. Take the class and be happy.","The class is pretty interesting, but does not necessarily do a good job of blending together the bio\/ chem \/ physics components. If you're looking for a pretty easy science A core that is also interesting, this is a good bet.","The best way to fulfill your Science of the Physical Universe requirement - Professor Sasselov is great, the course is interesting, and as someone from a non-science concentration I can confirm that it's not too difficult.","really easy and fun way to get an SPU requirement out of the way, plus the material is being taught by the leader of the team that is working on exoplanet detection","No necessary math or science requirement.","Great for a Science A - take it early because you'll get really into the material","very interesting material and very easy. best way to fulfill SPU requirement. so enjoyable, favorite class i've taken at harvard yet","This course will give you a good working knowledge of how the earth came to be what it is now, the formation of the universe, and how we can look for life elsewhere and learn about other planets.","This class is a good gen ed if you are looking for a low-workload class. That said, the lectures become boring during the second half of the semester, so be prepared.","This class is a great way to fulfill the SPU requirement. It is well-organized, requires very little work per week, and is fairly graded. The midterm and final were both fair tests, although they were comprehensive and required significant studying.","This class is the best way to fill your SPU requirement.  The lectures can sometimes be boring, but the overall coursework is interesting and it is not time consuming or hard.","This is a mostly interesting and not too challenging way to fulfill a Gen Ed requirement. I enjoyed the class.","Class is awesome, highly recommend regardless if it's a requirement.","Not a difficult course (and I was deathly afraid of the SPU Gen Ed requirement), and assignments are graded pretty easily.  The amount of material can feel overwhelming, though, esp. since section and lecture often don't cover the same things.  The material itself is pretty cool for the most part, and the professor is the coolest guy.  Extra things like in-class demos, buiding robots, observations nights, etc. are awesome.","This class is what a gen ed should be: extremely straight-forward, not too much work, interesting, and laid-back. Probably the best SPU around.","VERY easy core, as long as you go to (or watch) lecture and understand basic algebra, you'll do just fun. The subject matter is interesting.","This class is a very comfortable and manageable class even if you do not have much prior science knowledge!","This class is extremely disorganized. There is no \"general theme\" of the course and it is all over the place.","Great way to fulfill SPU","Great class - very interesting material.","As I've made clear, this was the best core class I've taken. It was well-organized and I am way more into planetary science now than I ever imagined I would be!","Take this class to fulfill a science a requirement. It's the best option.","This is by far the easiest SPU class and actually pretty interesting. You don't really need to go to lecture, the homework is minimal, and, if you get Wade as a TF, you'll learn a lot of things you would never study in another class.","Best class I've taken at Harvard. This class is so fun and interesting.","A lot of fun and the teaching staff really cares.","such a painless class but also really really fun. you'll learn a few things, fall in love with the staff, and probably get a good grade.","This course, simply put, is awesome. It's a great introduction to science through an astronomical perspective for humanities concentrators and fit into my schedule perfectly. I took AP Bio and AP Chem in high school, so I found this course to be very, very easy. However, for some of my friends who hadn't, they had to put in a little more time than me but it is still very doable. The tests are fair and the psets are very easy, but the lectures do get kind of dry during the end of the course and I found myself less interested. Nevertheless, I found section to be great and we got to play with lego robots! In addition, I really liked attending an observing night to use Harvard's telescopes.","This is an amazing class taught by a hilarious professor who truly is engaging and interesting to listen to.  The TFs are amazing and are as equally interesting and enjoyable to listen to.  The workload is totally manageable and the midterm and final are totally reasonable.  I would definitely recommend taking this class.","Lectures are boring but you don't need to pay attention if you take advantage of every section and exam review - easy A :) (and I am NOT a math\/science person)","It was very easy, and surprising very interesting as well. TAKE THIS COURSE. It has super minimal requirements but will make you reflect on life and the universe outside of class.","Utilize section and your TF, as they are very helpful in better understanding the material!","This is a fantastic way to fill a core as well as have fun learning about discovering life on others planets.","Take this!!! It is SUCH a great way to fulfill your requirement."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This course seems like it will be very easy but the material is disorganized and the lectures are unclear. The material, though largely basic, is presented in a roundabout way that makes it more complicated and Professor Sasselov is not effective or efficient in conveying information.","no comment","don't take the course if you're not interested in astronomy--it's really not as easy as people say it is, and the exams are really unfair","This is an excellent course if you, like me, have ever wondered why you live and what this whole world means in a broader scientific sense.  This course gives you a great understanding about the universe, from its founding to ideas about its eventual end.  I certainly look differently when I look at the stars today, and that is something which I hope you can one day experience.  It isn't a very hard class, do the reading (no one will, but do it) and you will learn a great deal.","If the midterm and final are more fair and true to the material then I would be more eager to recommend it.","It is supposed to be very easy... and, in many ways, it is. (No lab component and  many people  don't attend lecture)  But it's not a given.","A good, easy, sometimes kind of interesting SPU. Not so much about \"life in space\" as about \"lines of scientific evidence that astronomers use to determine if a planet might have life.\" Professor Sasselov is awesome, though.","This class is a ton more fun if you try to get more involved. Ask Dimitar about the origins of life initiative and see if you can get on the mailing list\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201cevery month they have loads of exciting events and talks you can go to where you really see how fast this field is progressing and what people on the front lines are doing. It's awesome!","This course is an opportunity to learn from one of the greatest professors in the field of astronomy. On the one hand, it is worthwhile SPU course: material that is not too simplified just because it is a general education course yet not too much time spent in lab that might be difficult for an already full schedule. On the other hand, it is unfortunately very disconnected with the students: lectures run very slow, sections can be boring, and exams unrepresentative of what you would think would be on them. Depending on how the course changes next year, I would at most recommend this course with reservations.","Great way to fulfill SPU requirement.  Light workload, straightforward class.  Be sure to study well for the midterm\/exam.  They are not hard if you spend the day before memorizing a study guide.  Not to much work otherwise.","This class is very disorganized and tries to do too much and misses out on focusing on what it could do extremely well. A little too much of the learned astronomer lecturing, not enough looking up in perfect silence at the stars.","Go to lecture","Great class. Nicknamed \"rocks and jocks\". Great way to get an easy A, comparable to Stat104","Solid course, cool lectures, interesting sections with a lab component. They definitely stepped it up a bit this year and made it more difficult than in years past, so keep that in mind and definitely make sure you have a genuine interest in the subject matter.","This class is far more technical than its description, and its assessments are extremely rigorous for a Gen Ed.","It's an ok course to take to fulfill your SPU requirement, but there are better ones out there.  If you're just interested in the subject matter, it won't disappoint, but it probably won't be phenomenal either.","A very interesting class with supportive TFs that combines a wide range of topics in physical science.","It's very manageable, and also very interesting. I know more about the universe and the possibility of life in it - it's cool knowledge to have.","Fun and easy course","This is the easiest SPU you will find. The lectures meander and don't provide that much value. But it's a fascinating topic, and you will learn things.","Has gotten harder.","The work is light, the material is interesting, and the grading is forgiving. The teaching staff is extremely endearing, and Professor Sasselov is a cool dude who really wants his students to learn in a fun environment.","Don't even bother going to class. The exams will focus on one or two little details mentioned over the entire course. So if you happen to not be an expert on whatever those may be, the exams will be incredibly difficult. A general breadth of knowledge of the material is effectively useless.","Easy, low time commitment, but the exams are designed poorly. Multiple choice questions worth more than one point, true and false worth up to 4 points, longer calculations only worth as much as the MC and T\/F.","Do not take this class. It is poorly structured, unfair, and boring.","The midterm and final are not easy.","took it because people said it was the easy spu gen ed, but it ended up being rather difficult in midterms and exams","Take natural disasters if you need to fulfill the GenEd  Requirement","I personally feel that basic knowledge of physics would be useful to get through the problem sets for this class. The material is mildly interesting, and Professor Sasselov is definitely an expert with a lot to offer in terms of the most up-to-date information, but it can still be a very dull class. I found myself all too often just trying to get the work \"over with\" and not enjoying the learning process. I sadly feel like I took little away from the course.","This class is easy. Like, really easy. Everything is reviewed in (excruciating) detail, and even without doing a single bit of reading (and probably not even going to all of the lectures) any student should be able to get a pretty easy A in this course. That said, learning about the solar system and outer space falls into the same realm as dinosaurs as far as \"fun\" is concerned, and for people who feel like going beyond the strict realm of the course there's a lot of cool stuff you can learn about - I personally spent most of lecture cruising wikipedia reading articles about moons and planets and subjects covered in lecture.","Everything","the homeworks can be a pain but if you take it with a group of friends then its definitely a good spu","You get out of it what you put into it.","It is disorganized and frustrating to be apart of. Do not take it.","It suffers from the famous gen-ed illness of being both intellectually childish and difficult to do well in.","It is a great introduction to the world of astronomy and very easy to grasp even for those who are humanities majors.","Fascinating!","Interesting topic, and Sasselov's enthusiasm brings a lot to the course. Expectations for exams are not always clear. But it's a great way to fulfill the SPU requirement, and the material is certainly very easy.","DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU HAVE A STRONG BACKGROUND IN THE MATERIAL BECAUSE YOU WONT LEARN WHAT YOU NEED IN THE ACTUAL CLASS SO YOU BETTER HAVE LEARNED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE...","The course material was too broad for any one component of the course to be incredibly interesting.","Should be much more interesting than it is.","This is the best class to take if you want to fulfill the Science of Physical Universe requirement. I am far from being a science person and yet I still found the class easy. The lab sections sometimes let you out early and the problem sets were painless to complete. Take this class if you want an interesting and easy gen-ed and learn about the possibility of aliens living on another exoplanet somewhere in the universe.","If you're a science concentrator looking for an easy and fun elective, take this class.","Take this class if you are interested, even somewhat, in astronomy and are looking to take a relatively easy Gen Ed, then take this class. However, I think I thought it was going to be easier than it was - you really need to do the text book readings and pay attention in lecture (not so much section) if you want to succeed. Although I thought I knew my stuff, I didn't do that great on the midterm or final, so it's by NO MEANS an \"easy A.\" Just a warning! But Sasselov is so funny and chill, he really just wants you to learn and take something out of the class.","I truly enjoyed this class. It was the model gen-ed: not too difficult, but with still a good amount to understand\/absorb; featuring a world-class professor who gives engaging twice weekly lectures, every single one of which I loved; backed up by a well-structured once-weekly section. The course is straightforward, which leaves you free to enjoy the more \"inspirational\" moments of Professor Sasselov's lectures, without feeling like you are getting lost in too advanced materials. I wholeheartedly recommend. However, be aware that there is great disparity in the quality of  sectionleaders. Don't be afraid to change in the first weeks as it will make a big difference!","It was a lot harder than I expected, especially not being a science person.  The course material, although interesting, felt disorganized and the exams were surprisingly very challenging.","The class is harder than you would first expect...","This class never requires a lot of work, but it is really interesting at times if you have more time to devote to it.","I found this course surprisingly very interesting. I would definitely recommend it -- it's not particularly challenging and I found that I actually liked the material.","Deals with the interesting question of the possibility of  life on another planet, but lectures were pretty dry.","This course is a relatively easy science Gen-Ed for people who may not have a strong science background.","It's easy and interesting, but sometimes the basic science they teach you is insulting if you took any kind of high school science or math.","the class is very loosely structured and jumps from subject to subject very fast, but if you attend all sections and lectures you should be just fine on all tests","This class is an easy way to fill and SPU requirement. However, the stringent math involves makes me weary to recommend with enthusiasm .","Beware! The course is poorly organized and becomes tedious by the second half. Avoid it unless you are willing to constantly reach out to your TF to figure out what is going on in a given week.","This is the worst class I have taken at Harvard, it's been a constant thorn in my side, and I wish that I could take back the decision to take this class.  It's reputation from last year was that it was a light, painless, entertaining Gen Ed.  I'm sure that after this year the reputation will be drastically changed, but if it hasn't, don't believe the hype!  The Energetic Universe happens at the same time, go across the hall and take that instead.","This course was challenging, and they don't do you any favors in terms of helping you along with the material. Expect to be self-sufficient learning concepts (especially if you get a bad TF), and expect to be tested on all sorts of things on the tests that you may not understand\/have solidly reviewed  how to do. When there are SPU courses JUST on physics, geology, astronomy etc, why take the course that makes you try to learn them all?","It seems easy enough, until the lectures are hard to stay awake in, the midterms kicks your ass, and then the material starts to spiral into a confusing sector. Not worth it as a GenEd.","The class itself is quite easy; the midterm and final were difficult","Easy class that is still fun","this class turned out to be much harder than i was expecting but the workload was not thhhat bad. just the tests took a lot of preparation, especially since the lectures and reviews were usually no help","Painless, fun way to get a gen ed out of the way. a little math","This class was advertised by former students as a fun and low stress Gen Ed that gave a good overview of life on our planet and beyond. While this was true, the exams were far more difficult than expected. The mid-term especially was brutal.","Oh, SPU 30, why did you scorn us so? Lots of students signed up for the class based on last year's deceptively high Q score, but little did they know that the course would be fundamentally changed for the worse by the teaching staff. The course lacks a defined structure and unitary focus, though it nominally deals with life, and the teaching fellows clearly have their own agendas in helping students \"prepare\" for exams that have nothing to do with the core principles of the course (at least the midterm). You know the course has a problem when the TFs themselves don't show up to lecture. That being said, 50% of the grade is practically a give-away and Prof. Sasselov is absolutely AWESOME and provides some pretty cutting edge information in lectures, so do make an effort to at least watch the lectures online and speak to him at some point.","Despite its reputation for being an easy class, it has become significantly harder: if you're looking for an easy A, look elsewhere","if you attend or watch lectures and go to section & participate you will do well.","This class was somewhat interesting and relatively easy, but it is not very well organized, so it can be frustrating at times.","The tests for 2012 were impossible and no one did well, but hopefully that will change in 2013.  Over all the class was good and worth taking if you need to fulfill a science requirement.","I started without knowing anything about astronomy. It turns out that you do not have to. Classes are interesting and easy to follow. Now I can recognize several stars when I look at the sky. A very rewarding class! As professor is working for NASA, very up-to-date information will be provided. It is just amazing to know what is going on in the field.","It's incredibly easy, you don't have to go to lecture basically ever, and the workload is very minimal to nonexistent. You also learn something about astronomy if you knew nothing beforehand (like I did). On the minus side, if you're looking to learn anything more than you would by picking up an astronomy textbook\/Wikipedia page and reading it for a few hours, then this class isn't for you.","Take this class. You will not regret it.","Very easy for students with any (even high school) science background. Actually quite interesting material.","The class was fairly disorganized. Lecture always seemed irrelevant and I had a very hard time paying attention. I learned material through the homeworks. Winston was an amazing TF though, very fortunate to have him","It really depends on your teaching fellow. I had a great TF, so I had a great experience. If you have a mediocre TF, it can be quite frustrating. Despite the TF, however, it is definitely one of the easiest ways to satisfy the SPU gen-ed.","Easy gen ed- but not too interesting","Go to lecture, the course will be infinitely easier.","don't take it unless you have at least 30 other friends taking it from whom you can get study guides and other prep stuff","This is not just a physics class. It's also chem and bio. It's not really SPU...more like a general overview of science with an emphasis on outer space","Very easy gen ed for those who were dreading the SPU requirement, like myself. The teaching staff is super helpful and enthusiastic about the material.","This class is a pretty good way to fulfill the SPU requirement, since there's very little work, no long labs, and some of the topics are pretty interesting, especially if you're interested in astronomy, space exploration, or the question of how life emerges on planets.  It could've been run a bit better (especially the sections), but the TFs are nice and generally helpful, and the professor is very knowledgeable.","This course was fascinating in it's exploration of the development of life on earth and how that can be studied in order to examine the rest of our universe for extraterrestrial life. I enjoyed the subject matter thoroughly, although I was a bit less enchanted with the lectures.","a lot harder then thought","This class got much harder this semester. Beware.","This class used to be a painless way to fulfill the SPU requirement.  Now, the exams have been made so difficult that the pain has been reintroduced.  Plus, Professor Sasselov's lectures are not interesting and the section component of the course, while a great way to inflate your grade, are not helpful for understanding the course as a whole.  I should have taken something more difficult but also more interesting.","Section can be great, but it depends on the TF.  Lecture can be painfully boring but they are crucial to doing well on the exams.  It was very helpful to have them videotaped so you could go back to them if something was unclear or if you missed class.  Most SPU's are terrible, I consider this one to be a lesser of many evils.","You may feel discouraged from attending lectures because they are videotaped but lectures are helpful preparation for problem sets and exams.","It is a little too much of everything.","The subject matter of this course is all over the maps. The material is interesting, but the exams are incredibly difficult to study for as the materials are different in section, lecture, and review sessions.","A great class to fill your SPU requirement.","Lectures could have been better (a bit slow and monotonous) but the material was much cooler once i had to know it for the exam and read about it. so very cool subject matter for an SPU, but just watch the lectures on fast forward videos instead. \r\n\r\nBut 25% participation, 25% homeworks (there are 4), 25% midterm, 25% final.  unfortunately a lot of hours","Do the reading!","This is not an easy science gen-ed like students make it out to be-- it is not an easy A, it takes hard work and outside knowledge to truly succeed in this class.","I didn't go to lectures for the majority of the semester and was able to get the gist of the course just fine. The intensity of your section will depend on who your tf is. Hopefully, the exams will be much more straightforward next year, too.","I was expecting this class to be easier than it actually was. There is not much work during the semester, but the exams were very difficult.","This class is another one of those Science Gen-Eds that decides to be extremely broad and end up just teaching skin-deep concepts condescendingly. That said, Professor Sasselov is clearly an expert in his field and the astronomy stuff is interesting.","This class was not was prescribed by last year's Q guide. Though it was rather easy, it was not as simple as it was originally said to be. Be wary that though this class is a good and relatively interesting way to fulfill an SPU requirement, it does take more work than you may think.","They made it a lot harder this year than last year. It was still sweet, though, because you never had to go, there was no lab, and there were very few psets. Definitely utilize your TF to get help with psets. The subject matter is actually really cool. As far as SPUs go, this is a good one for non-science people, but given that they made it harder, there are probably better options.","The material becomes difficult for a non-science person, especially because the labs sheets don't allow time for reviewing and clarifying lecture concepts","If you missed things\/was confused about the lectures, the Essential Cosmic Perspective is helpful, though it goes over concepts rather than specific formulas.","Not a difficult class, but lecture\/section\/homework\/exams don't line up very well. When the tests rolled around, the common question was \"What are we supposed to study, exactly?\"","This is a fun way to fulfill your science requirement.","if you absolutely must","Take this class for SPU.  Best decision I ever made, as this class was relatively painless.  The exam were harder than we thought they would be, but overall the class was manageable.","The requirements aren't too much, but tons of kids got crushed on the midterm and final because there's some material that's conceptually hard to understand.","easy gen ed","the material is fascinating but the midterm is impossible..you can't actually tell what's going to be on it since the head TF has a different idea of what the course is about--in our review session he basically drew a big timeline of the universe...which didn't even take place on the exam. The TFs (at least mine was) great...but they also have no idea what is important for testing since they didnt' see the midterm before we had to study....so nobody knew anything about anything come exam time","Everyone said this was an easy Gen ed. I figured that because I'd never taken physics, this would be the least painful way to fulfill the requirement. However, the way the course is run is that students do poorly on exams, TFs tell you not to worry about your terrible exam grades, and then somehow at the end, supposedly, everyone comes out with an okay grade.  Hooray!","Do not take this class if you want a rewarding class.","Do not take this class: If possible, wait a year to see if it is significantly changed next year. It was both much harder and less interesting than almost anyone was expecting.","Avoid.  This course is just awful.  The psets and the exams are awful.  The lectures are God-awful (I could endure the readings more than I could endure these lectures).","This is just about the perfect SPU Gen Ed - very interesting, good lectures, not too difficult, and on the whole well-marked. Also, the observation nights were one of the highlights of my semester - the course is worthing taking for these alone!","This class is no longer the joke class. This class, ladies and gents, is not a easy A. However, you can get an A, if you study and work hard. It's pretty fair, and if the material interests you, do take.","great class to take care of the SPU requirement; not that easy if you don't go to class, so make sure you attend lecture","It's an interesting class, but if you don't go to class you might not get a lot out of it.","If you need a Science of the Physical Universe course, this is definitely the one to take. Interesting lectures, optional readings, manageable homework, predictable midterms and finals.","The material presented in this course is some of the most interesting I've seen at Harvard. This class single-handedly made me wish I had discovered astronomy earlier in my life and become a Astro concentrator. Weird but true.","I loved this course. It was quick, painless, and to the point. THE SECTIONS WERE ALSO SO MUCH FUN. The homework was easy and the midterm and final were breezes. In all honesty, this has been my favourite GenEd!","This class will require very little work, but at the expense of lectures that aren't very engaging and midterms\/finals that are actually somewhat challenging.","I would skip it...it got hard this year.","The tests were quite hard! Keep up with your readings, go to lecture, and pay attention in section!","Really a pretty easy SPU, but actually, surprisingly interesting. I may have just found it so because I have forgotten much of the science I learned in middle school, but especially as the field of exoplanets is an expanding one in science today, I felt this course was very relevant and exposed me to a number of really striking ideas and new discoveries.","This class is not easy, the tests are difficult and there is not a big curve. If you are looking for an easy Gen Ed, do not take this course.","The course is not as easy as the previous years' Q guides have let on. It is pretty light workload from week to week (biweekly psets, really easy section handouts), but the material gets a little overwhelming come midterm or final seasons. The subject material covers so many different sciences and sometimes annoyingly gets bogged down on the details.","Some people think it is an easy class, but it is only easy if you treat it like a real class. Go to lectures and do the hw and its an easy A","DO NOT TAKE THIS. It was BY FAR my least favorite class at Harvard.","The class material is extremely interesting and if the course is refurbished a little its a definite class to take. However, this past year the lectures were dreadfully boring and the only way to learn the material is to read the book or get a study guide.","If you're interested in the subject matter take it, but for an easy gen ed, I would say there are more fun and less tedious ways of fulfilling the requirement.","Don't take this class. It is so poorly organized and lectures are dull. Take a gen ed that might consume a bit more time but you will actually take something away from. The material could have been interesting but this class is terrible.","Midterm and final were tricky, so study hard for those. Work is very manageable and lectures are generally insightful.","Pretty easy class, though the mid-term can be quite difficult. Make sure you go to section because it makes up a large amount of your grade.","Here's the thing, the class isn't actually that difficult if you are able to two things: use basic algebra and are willing to at least pretend to give a crap about learning the (very) basic concepts. Pretty much everyone came into this class expecting to have an A handed to them without doing anything and this year, the teaching staff weren't having it. Totally valid. BUT - if you're going to make your class into a legitimate class, at least back it up with a TF staff that cares and at least attempt to not make your course the most disorganized and disingenuous class ever. As a science concentrator, it's mortifying to see what the Science Gen. Eds are like; no wonder Humanities students are petrified of science.","You'll seem like you are ready for tests, but then you'll take the test and have no idea when the material on the test was ever discussed.","Not an easy class. You need to learn a lot of material that is not well taught.","The class has interesting moments and Dimitar is very well respected and knows what he is doing, as he works on the Kepler telescope team for NASA. The course is large and a bit too ambitious in scope, though if you go to lecture you'll come away with some interesting knowledge for sure. The midterm and final definitely need to be studied for, as there are some tricky questions in there.","This course is an easy way to satisfy your SPU requirement, but it's not especially intellectually engaging, and you won't come away feeling like you've learned a tremendous amount.","The lectures were pretty boring for this class, but the problem sets and assignments weren't too bad (just time-consuming). But, the exams were terrible and I don't think they related well to the material they taught us at all (and about 50% of your grade is based on exams).","This course covers a very wide range of material but is interesting if you're looking for a good introduction to the universe without hard science. Fun core. Get Peter's section. Well worth class on Friday.","They made the course much more difficult than the previous year. I took it thinking I was taking an easy elective but ended up having it become my main focus of studying for the latter half of the semester. Would not suggest","I did my high school thesis on Astrobiology and was really excited to take a course on it at Harvard. However, this course is the very definition of an easy GenEd: Not much is expected from you and you don't learn much. My high school freshman brother laughed loudly whenever I showed him my problem sets which sometimes literally could be solved by multiplying two numbers and boxing the answer. Problem sets quickly became known as \"sets\" because they were no problem.","not as easy as you think.","Do not listen to the Q score for this course.  It is no longer a gem, rather a class that seems easy only to learn that it is nearly impossible.  I hated this class.","Professor Sasselov is simply brilliant, and his lectures, while taped, are absolutely worth going to for the demos. (the gas-car action-reaction one was amazing!). Professor Sasselov is at the forefront of his field, and hearing about new breakthroughs in exoplanet discovery during lecture really emphasizes that you are at Harvard and listening to someone describe research that is changing what we know about life and the universe. The lectures at the end, especially, give you a new perspective on life and humanity's place in it. The teaching staff is fantastic, and they do try to teach the material in such a way that those without any background won't be disadvantaged.","It is a great topic with an obviously passionate prof & teaching staff. There are a lot of us in the course that have no interest in the topic and no motivation to take advantage of the observing opportunities or extra things they make available. I thought the lectures were boring and the pace was not one that kept my attention. Well-prepared lectures and sections but this class is a product of an SPU category that really needs work from the Gen. Ed. office. I took it because it seemed to be a painless way to do SPU. It took more time than I imagined and I didn't enjoy the experience. It is by no means overwhelming, but I think the course is much harder than in previous years based on previous comments.","This course is easy. Very easy.","The information discussed in the class is interesting, but the lectures are boring and the sections are not really helpful.  The structure is also not very organized.  The work leading up to the midterm was easy and then the midterm was harder than everyone expected.  Not a class I would recommend.","not really fair assignments","The class is great, but watch out for the exams. If you stay on top of the lectures and breeze through the readings it can be an easy A.","This class can be easy, but at least with this year, a lot of the homework assignments and the midterm were unfair. If you have a good TF (as I fortunately did), they can help you decipher what the homework problems are looking for and analyze the professor's lectures to figure out what the main points are to help you study. I do not know what I would have done without my TF though.","Way too hard if you have a limited science background.","This is not the cupcake course it's advertised to be. That being said, it's a very interesting course ad if you put in the work, you'll like it. The section component is a lot of fun.","This is a great class to take if you are interested at all in astronomy and earth science without getting too deep into it.","I took this class under the assumption that it was the most painless way to get rid of this requirement, and it very well may be (given that all the other options are not exactly amazing either).  There is minimal work required over the course of the semester and the distribution for grading is extremely reasonable.  Psets will not take much time to complete.  Section and lectures can be really dull.  As a warning, the midterm was also unreasonably difficult under the time constraints.","If you pay attention in lecture, you will get an A. Homeworks are simple and section notes are incredibly easy. The only thing that is complicated is the exam. If you are present in lectures, it will be easy. Most of the exam questions come from lecture, so if you were at lecture, you have basically a guaranteed A, at the least an A-.","Good class.","This is a very interesting Gen Ed, but you have to be willing to put work into it.","This course has great section leaders and sections.","Its a super interesting course and half of it is basically a gimme if you apply yourself; however, you have to be careful not to fall behind for the midterm\/final as those are fairly challenging if you're playing catch-up.","it's kind of boring but it's the easiest science of physical universe gened you could find!","It's a great class to fulfill this requirement. Maybe a little bit easier than it needs to be, but the subject material is legitimately awesome.","Easy, but lectures are tough to get through and necessary for doing well with little stress.  You will hate your life before the midterm and final but otherwise will be a breeze.","The subject material and sections are wonderful, but be prepared to be duped by test questions.  Dont think this class is an easy a, because if you dont commit yourself it will be rough going.","Definitely recommend.  It's not a \"fluff\" gen-ed, even though it does not require hard-hitting physics or chem\/bio.  Interesting because it pulls off presenting a history of the universe since the Big Bang in the context of cutting edge research.  Prof. Sasselov is at the forefront of his field.  Some students found the lectures boring, but I thought they were great.  If Winston Tao is a TF, try to get him.  He kind of does things his own way, but he is outstanding.  The final exam was incredibly difficult (mostly time-consuming--many students didn't have time to finish), but they will probably write a better one next year.","I think this course needs to undergo major reconstruction-it does have potential, but the energy in lecture and the content of the tests is unsatisfactory as of now.","This is a very frustrating course to take. Lectures are not engaging, the material is dense and therefore hard to sift through come evaluation time. You also will have to depend heavily on the internet\/textbook for problem sets, a luxury you do not have for finals. All of the sections were learning different material so everyone prepared differently for the midterm\/final. Those who did well (within my section at least) relied heavily on their high school science background, something I did not have.","The tests are harder than any of the assignments.","You learn cool stuff! Must-take course.","This class was supposed to be easy but the midterm and final questions seemed to come out of nowhere. I recommended taking another SPU if your looking for an easy stress free SPU.","as someone who hadn't done science or math in years, this class was a struggle. having said that, they do try to make it as easy and possible, and tfs are very willing to help.","This class is fairly straightforward if you're looking at fulfilling a gen ed. However, the lectures are VERY tedious, the exams are somewhat unpredictable and the course is disorganized. If you're motivated and interested about learning astronomy, take it. If you have 0 interest in the subject, you may not be motivated enough to do well in this course.","This isn't a cakewalk, but it isn't difficult either.","This course was not a lot of work but the material from lectures and sections never really lined up with material tested on homeworks and exams. Also remembering some high school chemistry is really helpful.","I would recommend this class if Winston Tao (and\/or his wife Jessie) were teaching this course as a section TF again. Without Winston's sections, this course could've been miserable for me. The content of the course is interesting, although it can get over your head sometimes."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The course was a bit too chaotic for my taste.  I didn't like how not even the TFs knew when some of the psets were due or going to be sent out.  When we wanted to learn the material and what our mistakes were, the staff was very vague in what they were saying to the point that a student would become jaded.  If you are looking for a good gen-ed to fulfill SPU, don't take this one unless you are well versed in the topic.  The course material was interesting enough and had some cool moments, but such moments were not constant in the course.","This class is not easy, at all. It is quite challenging. There is a lot of math involved, and though it may be simple math at times, sometimes it also requires a lot of skills that a student may or may not possess. Also,t he class covers a TON of information, so be ready to take very challenging midterm\/final exams that require you not only to memorize a lot of material, but also to do a lot of math and be able to speak fluently about every part of the course. I think the course would be better served if the final was NOT cumulative.","If you have any interest in basic astronomy, or if you'd like to learn more about Mars exploration and other NASA projects or life on other plants, take this course!  It gives a great overview of astronomy, astrobiology, and space exploration, and the professor is awesome. You'll also learn about current research and findings from the NASA missions (before the national press conferences!), you'll likely get to talk with astronauts and CEOs of space exploration companies, and you'll get to use the telescopes on the Science Center observatory.  Highly recommend this course!","Probably the least painful way to fulfill the SPU requirement. The class tries hard to be interesting and cater to people without a science background.","This course can become a bit more than you bargained for if you let it get away from you, but overall, it is easy.","After some structure, this course could really be popular at Harvard. It's very interesting stuff.","Easier SPU but at the same time hard bc so unorganized.  if you have a good TF aka Yale, then you can make it more fun\/easier to understand","This class is terribly disorganized. The goals of the course were unclear. The midterms were not returned for two months. TF's did not seem to be provided guidance for the goals of section each week. I learned very little and was unsure what I was supposed to be doing. It is easy, but by far, the worst class I took at Harvard.","GO TO LECTURE. it will be much easier.","An amazing class. Prioritizes learning over being tough. Really led to a positive environment. A true gem.","A relatively easy, painless gened, but the lack of organization can be frustrating at times. Honestly, I'd recommend taking a harder course if you are more interested in the topic.","As with any SPU, this isn't the time of your life, but the Teaching Staff (or at least Peter and my TF David) really try to make the learning experience fun and engaging.","The topic of this course is interesting, and Professor Sasselov and all of the TFs are invested in the course and try to make it work, but there is a definite lack of connection. I really spent most of the class usure of what we were actually meant to be learning.","Don't take this course unless it is absolutely the only option you have in order to fulfill the Gen Ed requirement or if your love of science is so strong that not even a horribly run course could kill it. While the professor and TFs are nice enough people who clearly are knowledgeable about the subject, they are not great teachers, especially for those of us without the strongest math and science backgrounds. I found the lectures to be highly boring and very difficult to understand, and they often did not have clear connections to sections and homework assignments. In short, this class was a major source of frustration and the worst that I have taken so far at Harvard.","Take at your own peril. It's not hard, but it's frustrating. DEFINITELY not for Senior Spring.","This class covers a wide range of topics that do not seem related. Lecture and section are very relaxed but the exam was much harder. Section was more engaging but I found to hard to pay attention in lecture.","Great GenEd. Very interesting material and the TFs are great. Section is awesome and TFs spend a lot of time answering any questions you may have. Lecture can be a bit dull at times but guest speakers are really cool (ex-astronauts etc.) Take it.","Probably one of the easiest class you'll take for Science of the Physical Universe gen ed.  Everything is pretty easy, but the tests are pretty challenging.","Very easy, but you have to put in the time. 2-hour sections, long lectures.","So, this class is easy, but its also the biggest pain you will ever have to deal with while at Harvard. If you are not a science person like me and need it for gened, I recommend you take it. It sucks, but you will get through it, especially if you have a good TF.","Make sure you review lecture materials thoroughly","Take it! It's fun!","This class is kind of phenomenal. 'Phenomenal' because the entire teaching staff cares so much about the students and the class, and wants nothing more than for everyone to have fun learning about astronomy - the professor is brilliant, and the TF's are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate; sections are chill but the activities and assignments are really unique; the material itself is simply fascinating as you go from discussing basic elements to whether or not life is possible on other planets; and the various other opportunities with this class (using the telescopes, talking with Mars rover scientists, etc) are just too cool. 'Kind of' because the one major drawback with the class as a whole is that lectures aren't presented in the most efficient way possible. Professor Sasselov knows so much that he basically just talks for 90 minutes, and it's all really interesting, except by the end you don't really know what the main points were and which parts were just intriguing side facts. If the lecture organization can be sussed out some more, everything would be so perfect.","this class is ballin'","As a student with very little background in science or physics, this class provided a great summary of the course material without being too strenuous or technical. Great class without a very heavy workload.","Although the course is \"easy\", if you have a Type-A personality you will be incredibly frustrated by the poor organization of the course. Lectures were dull and not well attended as a result, the midterm was not as difficult as last year but it was way too long and most people felt unprepared for it because it was unclear what the takeaway points were for the course.  Most importantly, lectures and sections were both too long and should be only one hour each.  And, assignments were never handed back on time, so you never knew where you stood, even if you sent multiple emails asking for them.  All in all, I thought it should have been a good course based on the topic, but it was very poorly executed (for the third year in a row).","It's a very very basic overview of some conceptual questions of origins of life. It's hard to define it because it covers so many disciplines: astronomy, physics, biology, chemistry, but all on a very basic level. It's both a strength and a weakness of a course. Sometimes you're not really sure what information is relevant. TF's and Peter are extremely helpful. Reading assignments were somewhat irrelevant to the course. Overall, a pretty easy way to fulfill the GenEd requirement.","Absolutely do not take this class. You will be frustrated all semester. Yes, lecture is optional and it's not very much work during the semester, but exams are obscenely long and come completely out of left field. The Professor exists in his own world and is hard to understand and often goes out on tangent. This class provides you with nothing useful or relevant to the rest of your education. You won't get any homework back on time, sections are too long and very poorly managed and if you get a bad TF it's really a killer 2 hours every week. This class is a joke and a disaster.","I want to begin by saying that the teaching staff within the course seems extremely passionate about the material, and are very kind. That has helped enhance the experience within the course.\r\n\r\nHowever, ultimately, this course needs some major revisions before it is up to any sort of standard for a Harvard University class.\r\n\r\nFirst, the lectures within the course are completely unstructured, and extremely monotonous. It is impossible to focus for an hour and a half, because there is no discernable structure to what is being said. The lecture slides are completely useless, as they often have an unclear semblance of words on them. No one attends the lectures, because they are ultimately unstructured and unfocused.\r\n\r\nSecond, the head TF of the course was COMPLETELY disorganized. Only once did he upload a homework when he said he would. Only uploaded the solutions to homeworks at the end of the semester, and did not upload solutions for homeworks pertinent to the midterm until the morning of. And never really responded to emails in a timely way. Also, our midterms were returned 6 weeks after we took them. If a student did that with an assignment, they would have failed.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is no overarching theme to the course. Yes, it is about life and finding life, but the narrative of the course doesn't flow at all, and every week we jump from one topic to the next willy nilly. \r\n\r\nThe positives are that there seems to be a lot of opportunities for extra credit. Although the concepts are simple, the course is actually not very easy (midterm had an average of 78, with SD of 12), but they decided to give us 10 points back for the curve, which was great. But 35% of the course is section, and 25% is hw, while the midterm and final each only counted for 20%.\r\n\r\n Ultimately, the course needs a lot of work, but actually has some potential. If this weren't an SPU, I would definitely not recommend; however, SPU is a category that definitely needs to be reworked, so for an SPU, I recommended with reservations. It doesn't seem like you're going to find a better SPU, because all of them seem pretty bad. But the topics in this class that do get discussed (the scale of the universe, etc.) can actually be really amazing if you can sift though the many unfortunate portions of this course.","This is a fairly painless way to satisfy the SPU gen-ed requirement. The teaching staff is committed to improving the course, and the material is surprisingly very interesting. There are a handful of annoying assignments, but none of them are difficult. I feel comfortable recommending this class to humanities concentrators.","Astronomy is a fascinating and humbling subject.  I find it the most metaphysical of sciences.  Prof. Sasselov is authentic and very knowledgeable and intelligent.  This is a relevant and very interesting class, though lectures tend to be on the slow-paced side.  Sections are always fun and interesting--the best was when we got to look at all sorts of organisms and objects under microscopes (water bears, planaeria, print images, microfossils---incredibly interesting!)  the observations were amazing, and the tf's are fun and love their subject!","Need an SPU. Can't get better than this.","Sections can actually be fun. They were relatively easy and Jessica was a really friendly and approachable TF. She always brought snacks! Lectures themselves start out interesting and then become dry over time. The teaching staff does try really hard to make the course material accessible and interesting. The scavenger hunt assignment was a nice alternative to section one week. Overall, relatively low workload. Only 5 problem sets!","interesting material, kind of a brutal class","If you want an interesting course about planetary science this is an excellent course. You learn about so many different fields in enough detail you'll be familiar to them but not in so much detail where you are constantly worrying about understanding topics and memorizing information.","The material was really interesting and Professor Sasselov is awesome! I highly recommend this course.","This class will get you with the very difficult midterm and final exams","It's an easy course, but it is mildly interesting. take it if you like the subject, but be willing to make an effort to take away anything from it.","Lectures are so boring and slow. They also don't actually provide much information. The stuff we go over in section is completely different from the lectures. Kind of disorganized","This course is easy but lectures are not interesting. It has more math involved than initially expected."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It is a fair course, but you should definitely be interested in the subject or else it can be a bit dry","This class is an easy way to get rid of your SPU, but I would absolutely not take it unless you need an SPU and can't get into\/ schedule Natural Disasters or PrimNav. It was pretty brutal a lot of the time. Luckily, the grading scheme makes it easy to get an A even if you don't do that well on the two exams, and there are only 5 psets, one of which is a book review. Lectures are really boring and nobody goes to them.","Lectures are either interesting and completely unrelated to what we're supposed to be learning or completely disorganized and impossible to follow. Section is pretty painless, and section assignments and homework are fairly easy. Exams, on the other hand, are super difficult. Be prepared to learn everything either in section from your TF, or on your own, from the textbook.","My friend told me this would be an interesting way to fulfill SPU. He lied. This class can't be much more boring even though the material is intriguing. No one goes to lecture, and they aren't wrong by this. Section is a little better though. Look elsewhere if you want to fulfill SPU, but there aren't many good ones. BTW Primitive Navigation isn't the way to go either supposedly.","I really, really hate studying things in a superficial and disorganized manner, and that's what this class is like. You'll learn little bits of material here and there and then have to regurgitate all of it and do nitpicky\/annoying math to boot. I've realized that learning about almost anything can be fun if there's a coherent structure and organization to the way it's taught, but I didn't get that here.","Great gened where you actually learn something and you enjoy learning it.","The exam is pretty tough, but the rest of this course is totally manageable and interesting even at times.","Be ready for tough exams","It is a simple way to meet an annoying requirement.","SPU30 was a very fun yet informative general education course. I really liked the material. The exams and problem sets are very fair. Definitely one of the best SPU gen eds!","Class can be pretty boring. Exams aren't easy. Don't underestimate it","This call was the vey time-consuming for a gen ed","it is a great class, and it is a lot of fun. a lot of people complained about the section activities (some of them for good reasons), but i learned so much about planets and life. very thought provoking indeed. the teaching staff is VERY VERY knowledable and dedicated. so is the professor. not too much work, although i wouldn't say its super easy either. in anycase, i recommend it.","Took this class for Gen Ed. If you are looking at it, chances are that you also need an SPU. Don't take this if you are looking for an elective. The concepts are mostly basic but there are many concepts, many disciplines covered. Be prepared to work with mathematical formulae and unit conversions you learned and most likely forgot in high school chem or physics.","This class is a joke. It's a fifth grade science class basically. You never have to go to lecture, as you can learn everything you need from the sections, and in addition, the lectures are incredibly boring anyway so you won't want to go anyway. It has a very low workload but the information is still pretty interesting. Definitely a gem of a gen ed.","Please do not take this class. Section is hit or miss. If you have a great TF, it's manageable. Unfortunately, a large part of the class got stuck with really bad TFs that made it insufferable. It's pretty easy to get a good grade -- just make sure to study for the exams as it's pretty easy to fail them. Based on the way they curve the course, exams end up not being worth too much but they can certainly bring you down a letter grade.","crush section and homework, do extra credit","The lecture portion of this class is not the most stimulating, and section can be rather long. I thought the material was actually fascinating, so I ended up enjoying the course--but it is very easy to check out and not put any effort in and still be able to do just fine. The homeworks are quite challenging, but the TFs are all incredibly nice and willing to help you figure them out. The midterm and final were also challenging, but if you study and make sure to review all the key topics, you will do just fine. I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a painless SPU requirement, and highly recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested in early life and\/or the formation of our universe.","It is a good class if you are interested in the planetary phenomenon.","Ehh.  It's an SPU gen ed.  It's relatively painless.  Almost everything is super easy.  You may feel like you're being treated like a middle schooler again, but that's the price you pay for a manageable SPU, I guess.","Sometimes it feels like you have to teach a lot of the material to yourself for the homework because lectures aren't always easy to follow. However, other than a few difficult questions on the homework, the class was relatively painless. Lectures could be a bit weighty but the section leaders do a very good job at reviewing lecture content. This isn't a bad way to get rid of the SPU requirement.","It's a very interesting class if you want to learn about outer space. It's not really that much work, but the homework can be tricky sometimes.","Midterm was a lot harder than expected but that was pretty much it.","Like most \"easy\" courses, if you don't do any work or pay attention you probably will find the exams very difficult. The homeworks aren't bad and the lectures aren't worth going to, but section is reasonably useful and enjoyable.","This course is really amazing! If I had taken this class my freshman year, I would have concentrated in the EPS! Have Mr. Simon Lock be your TF - he is amazing!","Professor Sasselov is too intelligent to teach this course to non-science concentrators. He is clearly on another level of intelligence, which leads him to believe the class is following him when we are not. Really not as easy as advertised. I would recommend another SPU class.","this class is painfully boring but the coursework is generally light and the grading policy is very generous","This class is one of the easier options for fulfilling SPU, but it is not the most interesting or well organized.","Definitely take this class as a manageable and easy gen-ed. However, try to make sure you know people in your section so you can do the group work well. Group work is a little annoying.","This course was good, but not great, and at times difficult although there were some opportunities to improve your grade. Professor Sasselov is amazing and the lectures were interesting to go to and also very informative. However, it will not always help for everything: a huge part of the homework, and a third of the midterm and finals is calculations, which lecture and section doesn't really help much for, particularly towards the second half of the course and you will often have to read the book and figure out what you have to do through practice. The subject is still fascinating, with new discoveries made every year in the search for habitable planets and I would recommend this over other SPU classes. You will learn a lot, but don't expect an easy class.","This course exposes you to the forefront of astronomy - Kepler data, exoplanets, exomoons - and helps you answer fascinating questions: how would you assess the habitability of other planets?  What does the current search for extraterrestrial life involve?  My one complain is this:  the lectures are a half hour too long.  The material covered is interesting and Professor is very nice and it helps that he truly loves the material, but you will grow bored after the first hour.  I attended the vast majority of the lectures and must be clear: with the exception of the guest lectures, nothing justifies the length of these lectures.","This class is relatively better than other SPU's because the bulk of the final grade comes from section attendance and participation, though there is pressure since section is graded on a 10-point scale. The midterm and final were fair, just study. Also, sometimes assignments were assigned quickly with little time, like a NASA debate for section a day before your section. Besides, that it was good--a lot of the material was really interesting.","If you are interested in astronomy but have no prior knowledge of it, this class is great!  The problem sets aren't too hard and there are only five of them.  The exams are very hard but they do not count for as much as sections\/problem sets so if you do well on everything else, you should do fine in the class.  Ended up being a pretty painless way to fulfill SPU.","As far as SPUs for non-sciency people go, this is a good one. Hopefully lectures become more relevant in future iterations of this course. But the assignments and the grading scheme are designed to help you get points. Also, I always enjoyed going to section, and my TF was incredibly willing to help outside class if I was confused (yay Simon Lock!).","You need an SPU. This one is definitely not the worst you can do. As a non-science person, I found it to be accessible but not so oversimplified as to be devoid of content. It does a good job of touching on a lot of different science topics (geology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, biology) and making them all tie into the larger themes of the class in interesting ways. Prof. Sasselov isn't the most charismatic lecturer and occasionally goes off topic, but he's incredibly smart and for the most part is good at relating the very latest research in the field to the course.","A great gen ed for people not well-versed in the sciences, and is framed in a very interesting subject.","not a bad way to fill SPU requirment","This was a great option as an SPU for people with some interest in the topic and without any real science background. Highly recommended for humanities\/ social science students.","This course is a great way to fulfill the SPU requirement - not too time consuming, and the Professor and TFs really want you to do well.","There are many reasons not to take this course; at the core, SPU 30 presents a case of false advertising. The course is titled 'Life as a Planetary Phenomenon;' the word 'life' appears five times in the course catalog's description. I enjoyed biology in high school, and thought this course would include plenty, making it a great way to get through the GenEd requirement I was least looking forward to. Be warned: you will not find biology here. SPU30 makes a nod to the concept of natural selection and covers some basic concepts of cell structure and phylogeny, beyond which you will find a never-ending MATH-fest. If you take this course, you will be doing lots of MATH. MATH is what you will be doing here. Your friend may have told you that this course is an easy way to get rid of the SPU requirement. Your friend is a moron, or else viciously leading you into a trap. The problem sets are egregious, requiring leaps in logic which a physicist might accomplish on a good day. They have little to do with the example problems provided in the lackluster textbook. This is not a class for humanities concentrators looking to coast. I could go on, but I suspect these issues and others are problems more with the SPU GenEd than with this specific class. If you insist on enrolling, trudge through your p-sets, pray that you get an outstanding TF, and inflation will send you away with a non-fatal grade.","This class can be very enjoyable and a great learning experience, but do not take if you don't enjoy math-heavy problem sets.","I have mixed feelings. As someone who has no background in math\/science, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the subject matter and the way it was structured in this course. Professor Sasselov's lectures were somewhat dry (though I appreciated his many efforts to make the class engaging), and, honestly, few people attended. The exams were unreasonably difficult, but this is made up for with an absurd amount of extra credit and very high section grades. At the end of the day, I think it's a fine way to fulfill SPU. It's not perfect, but it could be worse."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.00","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"96","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 30","course_id":"2030","cat_num":"5680","1s":"7","2s":"13","3s":"20","4s":"17","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 30","course_id":"2030","cat_num":"5680","1s":"5","2s":"19","3s":"29","4s":"7","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 30","course_id":"2030","cat_num":"5680","1s":"26","2s":"28","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
