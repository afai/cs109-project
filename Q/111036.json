'10":{"comments":["You have to rely a lot on other students and the section TFs, but it's hard to justify a career\/ concentration\/anything in statistics without the class. It's definitely core material.","This course is potentially extremely interesting. It is supposed to cover material that is both fascinating in its own right, and widely applicable. However, the quality of teaching, particularly the lectures, must improve dramatically to make it worth anyone's time. If the course stays the way it was this semester, there are probably better and more effective ways of learning basic statistical theory than taking stat 111.","Take the class if it's required, but make sure to attend sections otherwise you may find yourself a bit lost in the material.","go to Edo's office hours; he is very nice and much more helpful in person than in lecture. be sure to go to Kevin's section also as he is the most comprehensible TF. you will not survive the class unless you go to tf office hours and sections--homework is unrelated to lecture.","You MUST take this class! Stat 111 is a necessary component of your education. Regardless of anything else, you need to invest in statistics. I know plenty of people who regretted not taking 111 as an undergraduate. Employers are impressed by your knowledge of statistics.","Not a terribly bad course, just not a terribly good one either.   Actually quite a bit easier than Stat 110, for what its worth.  But what it gains by being easier it makes up for by being many, many times more boring than Stat 110.  Lecture isn't always worth going to, but the book is abysmal (they changed it this year because apparently last year it was even worse), so you really have to go to section to learn the material.","To really learn the material, you will have to sit down with some supplemental texts.  The professor focuses more on applications but I feel the theory in Casella and Berger is really helpful in actually understanding what is going on.  It is a very cool course in helping you to understand what statistics is really about.  You really have to be excited about the subject though to like the course.","There are more interesting statistics courses if you don't need this as a requirement. Compared to the experience of Stat 110, this course disappoints.","I would not recommend taking this class. It was very difficult and it was a challenge to do the homeworks as the textbook was useless. The TF's were helpful when they were at office hours, but I often got the impression they did not really care about the class at all. I don't think I ever saw a TF attending a lecture and sometimes they had different ways of solving the problem to the professor and the book, which was confusing. Overall, I thought the class was very disorganized, with TF's and the professor occasionally giving out conflicting information. Lectures were also often confusing.","Repetition of various concepts that have already been taught in other courses at a slightly higher level, thus I didn't feel that I have learned enough.","This course does not help you build any understanding of statistical inference.","I really enjoyed this class despite it's shortcomings.  The course was disorganized, the book was largely unhelpful, and problem sets could sometimes be frustrating.  However, the material consistently interesting, and the problems of the course were never so problematic to ruin the experience.","This class is good if you're smart; if you aren't, you'll have difficulty, but it won't be impossible.","really good content, but difficult and depending on teaching may just be confusing.","Only take this course if you have to. It is not that fun and you don't learn a lot. It's a shame that this is a requirement for so many things and it is so poorly taught.","Sam and Kevin are awesome TFs, the material of the class is good, but the textbook and the lectures leave more to be desired.","If they get a better professor, DO!! take this class.  The TFs (especially Sam) are generally great and the material is interesting.  The lectures were completely useless.","If you don't want a more theoretical understanding of statistics and only seek to learn the tools applicable in real life, you don't have to take this class. You'll learn the whole toolbox in Statistics 104. This class is for only those who want to take their statistical knowledge to the next level. Professor Airoldi is very helpful in office hours, so make sure you go to those if some concepts are not clear.","I would recommend against taking this class: the professor cancels lecture frequently (4 times this semester); lectures are straight from the textbook so they don't provide any additional information; the textbook itself is unnecessarily complicated and confusing.  I feel I could summarize the concepts I learned in this class in a few sentences.","Might be ok if Airoldi is not teaching it.","The professor was a nice guy but his teaching was horrendous. The TFs should have taught the class.","programming experience is helpful","work with people. Go to SECTION","Not a very well-organized class, but maybe better once the kinks are worked out.","Shop this class to see if they have their stuff together before committing to it.","If Edo is teaching it, do not take it. It is a complete waste of your time.","Better than some alternatives like Econ 1126, now that it counts as econometrics for Applied Math: Economics. Some of the material was useful and I learned it effectively. However, lectures were not very useful, the problem sets took a very long time and were not always fair, and much of the material was too abstract and theoretical to be very relevant.","Stat 111 ideally should be taken after stat 110 to get a complete story however don't expect this course to be anywhere as good as stat 110.  Whereas the Blitz was amazing and enthusiastic and we learned a lot, here you'll learn very little unless the course changes and the professor doesn't really care about the class.  He canceled class over 5 times! I've never had a prof do anything like this.","wait for a better professor","it was hard at the beginning but you will eventually get used to the professor's teaching style at the end. no need to panic about getting loss.","Be willing to work and you will be fine.","Get Airoldi to change the book and start teaching something useful. I don't mind theory, but at least give some motivation behind the concepts.","Course materials are very important,so if you plan to study deeper in statistics, you'd better take this course(or learn the materials by yourself). Neither the course nor the book was not very helpful. Check who's teaching before you decide to take this course.","Stat 111 has the potential to be a great course, if the professor becomes better organized and improves his lectures.  The material is useful and interesting.","Despite some troubles with the prof's lecturing style, I do feel as though I learned quite a bit in the class. I think the class could have done more to improve our in-depth understanding and intuition behind the statistical concepts--but that is a criticism which can be applied to far more classes than just this one. The sections were really what made the class decent for me.","I would only take this course if really necessary. You could learn all the important concepts in classes that use Bayesian updating like CS182, or other statistics class. Not as important as Stat110 at all. Moreover, the class was not that easy to be called an easy A.","This class was overly difficult. The material is way down in the weeds and not taught in a way that leaves you understanding the fundamental concepts","Take this class so that you can take higher-level stats classes. Don't take this class for its own sake.","This course has many organizational issues it needs to figure out. For instance, notations. A student could literally spend the whole time just learning notations (and not the material) because the professor, TFs, and the textbook all use different notations. The professor clearly needs to communicate with his TFs more. Furthermore, the professor needs to be more faithful to his textbook, even though the textbook is awful.","Take this course if you're really really smart and can teach yourself the material, because you aren't gaining anything from lectures\/the textbook.","It's just too easy and you don't cover enough stuff to make it worth your while.  I mean, we didn't even cover regression.  Also the professor is SO boring and mumbles.","The professor was well meaning but his lectures were poor. He should be better the next time around as he'll be teaching the class a second time.","Still a work in progress.  Not structured well.  It needs a consistent Prof to mold it over time.","It's subject matter that that is really useful, and this is stuff you should know, but the class wasn't all that great, especially compared to stat 110.","The material the class covers is interesting and good, but the class does a VERY poor treatment of presenting it and consequently I did not really learn it until the final. That being said, it could be better in future years than what we had to deal with--especially if they have another textbook or another Professor. Be ready to work hard though. The curve is pretty tough.","Stat 111 is a disaster. It's like Defence Against the Dark Arts -- a cursed class where lecturers don't last much longer than a year. As a result, they will be inexperienced and disorganized. The material is taught in a haphazard manner. You will feel miserable and confused. This class really isn't worth it -- take Astronomy 16 instead.","Definitely attend section. The TFs clarify much of the more difficult course material.","I would say that reading the text, in many instances, was a good way to supplement my understanding of the material.","You will likely learn much of the material in section - the text and lectures are often only mildly useful."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Very good course overall","sigh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you have to take it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6just power through it.","If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a statistics major you basically have to take this course. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about inference, and if Kevin Rader teaches it, it will probably be very application-based. If you were hoping this class would be rigorous and beautiful like Stat 110, be prepared to be a bit disappointed. This class focused more on applying methods we learned, and we did not delve too deeply into the theory or necessarily learn why certain things were true. The homework questions were pretty well-written, though, but you will probably find yourself doing a lot of R coding. This is very tedious but is necessary and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good exercise, so make sure you have some experience in R or programming in general before you start in the class. Overall, probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match up to Stat 110 in terms of beauty, but a pretty decent statistics class.","Beware of typos and not really learning much theory at all","This was, in my opinion, a great complement and extension of STAT110. I thought that data manipulation was super cool, and it's basically the inverse of STAT110. You can do much more with the techniques that you learn in this class than with STAT110, and you are definitely more aware of common statistical techniques used in academic literature.","Kevin is a great lecturer! Take this course if you want to learn more in-depth about hypothesis testing and statistical model fitting.","Interesting and useful application of Stat 110 to understanding inference at a more theoretical level than the 100\/104 series.","Stat 111 was a great course - so much better than 110! Rader is a great professor and is always accessible outside of class! The problem sets are manageable and you can really see how the material can be applied in real-world situations.","The course offers a Bayesian and Frequentist approach to inferential statistics. Essentially, one learns how to make claims about parameters of populations which is an essential part of many academic disciplines. You also get a very hands on approach since almost every pset is accompanied by a full data set.","The midterm is not very relevant to the kinds of questions asked on the homework, so make sure to really understand the concepts of the course","Kevin is nice but he makes more mistakes per lecture than most professors will make in a semester, so don't print the slides until after kids correct them in class.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't take this course unless it's a requirement. The material is dry, the class moves really slowly, and the examples in class don't build intuition at all, as you just sit there and watch Kevin set derivatives equal to zero.\r\n\r\nThe psets were repetitive to a comical degree - seriously, the number of times we had to calculate a exponential\/normal\/poisson mle or write a function called expo.loglik...","This class is great if you do a lot of research and want to know how to rigorously analyze your data. The class is more focused on teaching you tools than on teaching theory.","The exam questions may not be like the practice problems.","This is overall a good course. The material is relevant and interesting, and it's not difficult. Kevin is very personable, and his lectures are very comprehensible.","This course is a little dry but its so necessary for everything that you should sit through. Kevin Rader is a good lecturer and he makes it as interesting as it can be. There's also lots of applications and computation problems.","The material itself may not be hard as Stat110 per say, but I felt the things we learned and the Rader's teaching style to be much less engaging than 110, so I struggled much more in this class. But for stat, it's kind of something you just have to slog through.","Enthusiastic professor - won't be taught the material from anyone else more effectively.","It's harder than people make it out to be.. and a lot of messy algebra.","Don't let this class stop you from getting an ec secondary! I thought it would be terrible and really hard, but compared to Stat 110, Stat 123 or a lot of quant classes, this is pretty straightforward. \r\n\r\nThe course had some organizational issues this year, (as Kevin said at the midterm, \"it wouldn't be Stat 111 without a typo\") but nothing egregious, just enough to make people who like to work ahead mad. Kevin is really accessible, and Lo-Hua was an awesome TF.","What can I say...Kevin is Kevin. And I mean that in a very positive way. He is very down to earth, and he treats the material as something anybody can get with some effort. He's also very approachable and funny, with his favorite transition in lecture being, \"So what the HECK does that mean??\" I'm gonna start busting that one out in random corners of my life. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good introductory statistics course. I feel like I'm leaving with a solid understanding of basic statistical theory. You will learn precisely what p-values and all that stuff mean\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich is pretty important, since stats are everywhere.\r\n\r\nOh, and I never realized that guys and girls, on average, face different directions when showering. Which is to say, the way Kevin incorporated the surveys from the first day of class into the course was awesome.","This class teaches you a lot of useful tools. It's not as difficult as Stat 110, but it's not as interesting either.","Statistical inference is an interesting topic, this course is a good introduction to it.","This is a really great followup to Stat110! It provides a completely different perspective and twist on what was learned in that course. I personally also really liked Kevin as a lecturer, and felt that the class was really well-organized.","This course was frustrating at times because the homework was made unnecessarily time consuming. Lectures were difficult to follow along with. A good, practical introduction to R. Not terribly difficult, but at times frustratingly time consuming.","Stat 111 covers much of the same material as Stat 104, but at a more rigorous mathematical level. Instead of simply plugging numbers into given equations, you learn to decide which concepts to use to answer a given question and how to adapt standard methods to different settings. As a result, Stat 111 is much more rewarding and generally applicable.","It's not the most alluring subject material, but you'll learn a lot (esp. about likelihood). Dr. Rader does a really good job making it as interesting as possible, and the problem sets are very helpful in understanding the material.","Let me tell you a little story about the end of the semester. I had back-to-back-to-back finals on the last three days, with 111 smack in the middle of it all. I was a bit worried- I had done disastrously on the midterm and had not really learned much in lecture. (I don't know about you, but an hour and a half of uninterrupted lecturing about log-likelihood ratio test statistics does for the soul what the Lannisters do to captured Starks.) Luckily, Professor Rader promised us three sets of practice problems, complete with answers and explanations, to be posted during reading week so we could all study with ample time to prepare our cheat sheets (magnifying glasses sold separately). Now, little did we know, Prof. Rader was also defending a thesis, or dissertation, or Winterfell, or something that sounded vaguely academic. Of course, he could have simply asked his TF staff to prepare problems from their section notes. Lo and behold, he does not. Instead, I go all reading period, preparing for my first exam, waiting for practice problems to fall like manna from heaven so I can finally learn exactly what a log is, much less a log-likelihood ratio test statistic. The first set of problems finally arrives, maybe four days before the exam. (It might have been four and a half, but it certainly wasn't during reading period. Remember, this final was on the second-to-last possible day, which means that all the while I get to look out at all my beautiful friends returning home to Florida, and California, and sending me these demoralizing and de-incentivizing pictures of beaches and other scantily-clad beautiful people.) So finally, midway through exam week, I get to work on these practice problems, and then wait another day and a half for the solutions to be put up. Practice problem set number two finally gets posted two days before the exam, with the answers following the next day. Waiting for practice problem set number three was more excruciating than watching Tyrion wrongly accused of murder, and yet lasted infinitely longer. You see, practice problem set number three doesn't exist, and probably never has. Kind of like my friend's sympathy when I told him this saga, and he politely reminded me that he was in five classes, and had five finals, none of which involved made up tests about logs, likelihoods, or pretty much anything else that started with the letter l. \"Check your whining privilege,\" he told me. I told him to shove it. Now I know what you're thinking: why did I just read this ridiculously long and pointless story? Good question. You could've just scrolled down.\r\n          \r\n\r\nMy TF was great though.","Kevin Rader is the best teacher at Harvard. The material is fantastic and really interesting, I liked it a lot better than 110 to be honest. The stuff is really cool and is more applicable to how statistics are used in the real world, in my opinion. Great class!","Great class! Rader is an awesome lecturer.","Great course, Kevin is the man. You should take it fer sure","Kevin is a great teacher. going to lecture is very helpful on the problem sets, which can be fairly time consuming.","This class is very doable.  You learn some useful things and it's not very painful.  There's a lot of algebra involved and the problem sets are a little tedious, but overall, it's a pretty standard class.","I loved the material of this class. Puts all the concepts you learned in 110 to use. The class isn't too difficult and the workload is definitely manageable. Kevin was great at explaining the concepts to us in lecture. Although sometimes, I wish he did a little bit more proofs to help us understand the equations better. I think Kevin is a great guy, but my goodness he was terribly slow. For the final, he took forever to upload his practice problems. And then he didn't even finish uploading the solutions to the practice problems until like midway through the day before the final. I was so very frustrated with this. He also makes like 10 million typos and it's quite difficult to deal with sometimes. But other than that, he's a great lecturer and I loved the class. He just needs to not make typos everyday.","Stat 111 is much improved under Kevin Rader's leadership. It's still not a perfect course. I feel like I didn't learn as much as I could have, because the psets ended up being so much about R code, rather than the deeper underlying concepts. It's not like Stat 110 where the psets really challenge you to learn and process the material.","A lot of R, but the assignments were all pretty interesting.","Stat 111 is not as fun as stat 110. I don't think this is the fault of the professor, or the course staff, or any logistics of the course; I think the material is just inherently less interesting. There is much more algebra, either to piece together tedious proofs or to calculate desired quantities, and it can get really ugly. I feel like there are fewer concepts than stat 110, and just much more tedious work. I would not recommend it as an elective because it's not really enjoyable and you can get the same data analysis skills from stat 104 for much less work.","A pretty tedious course.","it's pretty interesting and practical","check who's teaching the course before signing up","Until the kinks of this course are worked out and the exams are better written, I cannot recommend this course. Filled with typos and exams with questions that to beyond material we've seen before are unacceptable. Unfortunately it is a statistics requirement.","If you don't want practice problems for the tests posted the day before the exam, don't take this class.","This is the most badly taught course I've ever taken. Problem sets were tedious and handed back weeks late or not at all. Half the midterm relied on material not touched on before, which the instructor slipped into review notes the day before without telling everyone. Practice problems for the final were handed out at the last minute, even though exam was one of the latest. If you have to take this, wait until they change instructor.","Hopefully the number of typos and mistakes will decrease next year. There was often conflicting material on lecture slides, HW, and section notes, which was frustrating. The midterm and final this year was also hit-or-miss, as this was the first year of Kevin teaching....","Stat 111 seems to have been much better this year with Kevin Rader teaching it now. It was a challenging class but it is necessary for any stat concentrator. I really enjoyed Kevin's teaching style but it would have very helpful to have had more example and practice problems.","Awesome class! Kevin Rader is a great instructor and his assignments actually involve real data (will learn to code in R). Fair exams, moderate workload.","This class feels very useful","It's important who the professor is.","I thought the class could have been taught much better than it was. Towards the end of the semester, I still showed up to lecture but hardly payed attention. I found that sometimes, going to lecture confused me to the extent that I spent more time than necessary on the problem set, and that not paying attention in lecture often resulted in less confusion. Obviously that is not a very good sign. Kevin uses powerpoint slides for lecture and only answers the questions he has in the slides in lecture, but he often doesn't explain fully, which is confusing at times. Also, there were an inordinate amount of typos on everything he produced, whether it was lecture slides, homework, or exams. But other than that, I learned a lot about inference.","This class is a requirement for Stats but is kind of a pain, just saying","This class provides a practical grounding for the material covered in 110 and is far more straight-forward (and thus, easier). It recapitulates much of the material from STAT 104 or STAT 139, but with a slightly deeper sense of the estimation issues involved, so it's somewhat but not entirely repetitive.","Stat 111 is a really dry course with a great professor. Kevin Rader rocks; I'm had him in 104, 107, and now 111. He really really knows his stuff, and he's an absolute pleasure to listen to in lecture. His humor also can't be beat. Overall, the psets aren't bad, exams can be a bit tricky (though nothing like 110) and perhaps harshly graded, and the R code can get a tad annoying though not that overwhelming. I don't know what can salvage this class though because the material just isn't that interesting. Take it if you have to, but focus on the good things, like Kevin.","This course is a great complement to Stat 110, and makes sense to be taken immediately after it. I think with a little logistical improvements, this class has the potential to become one of the \"great courses\" at Harvard, akin to Stat 110, CS 50 etc. \r\n\r\nThe material is super interesting, and Kevin makes sure it is always connected to the real world. While he isn't always the most structured, Kevin truly wants to see you learn and enjoy the class. Also he's just a great guy - you should make an effort to get to know him!\r\n\r\nTake this class to learn about \"actual\" statistics!","This class is really interesting, and has some really cool applications to applicable statistics. The professor is really enthusiastic, and although class can seem a little long, the psets are very intriguing. It's very interesting to learn the background to many of the tests we learned to use in stat 104.","The class was ok overall. It felt a bit disorganized this first iteration, but things will probably improve in future iterations. Also, the class is taught using powerpoint, which means that there was often a lot of information presented all at once and sometimes just too much information.","Great introduction to R, for those who don't know how to use it. Lectures have a good balance of theoretical concepts and practice problems - you don't really need the textbook! Problem sets are also very manageable.","The class material is great, and Rader has a lot of the right traits of being a great teacher. The problem is, he wasn't quite there this year. He made a lot of mistakes in lectures, and didn't seem too concerned when he was corrected. It took him a long time to post practice problems for exams online, and when he finally put answers (24 hours before the exam), there were still mistakes. Still, he's enthusiastic, and if he gets his act together this could be a really good class","I find the topic of statistical inference interesting, so despite the terrible disorganization of this course, I nonetheless enjoyed engaging with the material.  There were way too many typos in the problem sets and exam practice problems (both the questions and the solutions), and even in the exams! And also, the posting of many of the practice problems were way too late into the studying period for the final.","One of the more challenging courses at Harvard. Be prepared to work hard and spend your nights doing problem sets. Definitely go to section. Kevin is a great teacher and really cares about his students. Exams are very tough though","Solid course that covers very useful material, especially if you are interested in doing scientific research. Not the most exciting course, but Professor Rader does his best at making the material interesting and his enthusiasm is great! I would recommend this course simply because the material is useful. It's also not too hard.","You'll hear so much about likelihood functions.  Although the material can get very dry at some points, Kevin really does a fantastic job lecturing.","It's difficult, but not as conceptually difficult as Stat 110. Stay on top of the lectures and psets, and be sure you actually understand the material. The course material is actually kind of cool. If you're thinking about taking 111, it's probably b\/c you want to concentrate or do a secondary in stat. As I'm sure you found out in 110, only the strong survive.","A good class to get the basics of statistics, if you want to become reasonably familiar with the principles of it.","Definitely take this course if Kevin is teaching it again--he is a fantastic lecturer and really cares about the students! There were many typos since this was the first iteration of the course, but these are bound to get better in future iterations. I took Stat 111 as an elective even without Stat 110 and found it manageable (but hard work!), and now feel like I have a solid foundation in statistical inference. You will also feel semi-proficient in R after taking this course!","Kevin is a phenomenally clear lecturer and very accessible and reasonable. However, sometimes mistakes were made in the class that confused me and other students I talked to and did homework with. You get much more out of the class by asking more questions.","Go to sections. TFs really help you process the material.","Great class but if you are not a fan of applied statistics, it can be boring.","Rader is awesome and the course is better than people give it credit for.","It's a good class. Kevin Rader knows what he's doing. Go to section.","I like Kevin's teaching style. It is a course you shouldn't miss in Harvard.","Kevin is great although his exams can be ridiculous in that they will test previously untested material.","Only take it if you need it for your concentration or secondary.","A good introduction to statistics that is more rigorous than Stat 104. It may not be as challenging or rewarding as Stat 110, but it is a decent course if you'd to like to learn some inference using your knowledge of distributions.","STAT 111 is a good class to follow STAT 110; the teaching staff is extremely helpful and willing to assist in any way that they can.","Needed for stat secondary. Really boring course, boring material, and unnecessarily difficult.","Not sure why the stat department can't get this one right. Part of it is that the material is inherently less interesting. Would be a lot better if they integrated more 110 into the course. Kevin does a pretty good job explaining the material, but he makes a few typos in the lectures which are distracting and generally, the class lacks the mathematical umph that made 110 challenging but very rewarding.","It's hard but very useful","Some concepts in 111 are cool extension of 110. You'll see some interesting new takes on random variables (where their parameters aren't necessarily constant) and learn about the basics of Bayesian inference. If you like statistics enough, you'll be able to soldier through the class. That said, the course felt disorganized this year; we didn't make it through all the material we should have, and the course materials (lecture slides, practice midterms\/finals) often had errors. Kevin and the TFs are very open and helpful in office hours, but the class can definitely get frustrating if you can't make it to them.","Stat 111 is among one of the most applicable courses I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken here. The course teaches you the basic tools of inference statistics, delineates Frequentist vs. Bayesian perspective nicely, and is a great extension of Stat 110, showing you how to think intuitively about probability distributions in modeling and how the language of random variables, expectation, variance, and distribution apply to real world settings through simulation, computation, and problem solving. \r\n\r\nIn terms of preparation, having a solid grasp of Stat 110\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concepts (in particular random variables, distributions, properties and stories between them and definitions of expectation, variance, and covariance) is essential. Being good with summation manipulation, algebra, and derivatives is also useful. Essentially all the applied math skills! Having MATLAB\/CS50\/basic coding experience is useful too, as the usage of R is a nice touch to make the theory more applied.\r\n\r\nKevin Rader did a fantastic job modeling this course after Stat 110. Especially after 111 did not get fantastic reviews last year, Kevin did a good job building off of Stat 110\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probability foundation. The material itself is hard to understand conceptually\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is more subtle in some sense than 110, and I think I would still need future stat courses to really understand inference. But this course was a fantastic start. TFs also did their best to help\u00e2\u20ac\u201dJoseph in particular designed his section handouts to reinforce concepts from class and help with the HW. I was also really excited to see concepts come up in life science research I was conducting at the time\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phenomenal to see to how many things Stat 111 can be applied."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.90","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"197","response rate":"70.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 111","course_id":"4832","cat_num":"1836","1s":"4","2s":"13","3s":"38","4s":"58","5s":"26"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 111","course_id":"4832","cat_num":"1836","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"65","4s":"50","5s":"15"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 111","course_id":"4832","cat_num":"1836","1s":"1","2s":"33","3s":"82","4s":"19","5s":"4"}},"success":true}
