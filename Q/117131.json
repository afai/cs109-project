'11":{"comments":["You should definitely take this class. It's both practical and theoretical. The Professor is amazing and  really cares about teaching and his students.","Take this class.  It is extremely practical and extremely interesting.  Tirthankar is an excellent teacher and it is easy to see how the topics in this class apply in the real world.","This is a great course on time series analysis. Tirthankar is a clear and approachable lecturer, and the course is not overly demanding, but you still learn a lot. It's amazing what well modeled time series can predict, and the final project is lots of fun!","Very thorough introduction to Time Series. No previous knowledge required on the subject, the course introduces first the basic tools, and builds up entirely on these tools. The classes are very interactive, and the topic itself is both useful and interesting. \r\n\r\nThe ratio \"stuff learned doing homework\" \/ \"time spent on homework\" is excellent: the homework is to the point and makes good use of your time.\r\n\r\nFinally, the project you create at the end makes you realize how much you've learned, and how applicable these tools are.\r\n\r\nDefinitely recommend this course.","If you want to apply statistics to any business or financial context, this course is a must. Basically, any study of a random variable that changes over time in some predictable fashion would greatly benefit from the tools of this course.","You learn some really neat stuff, and professor Dasgupta is great.  It's a deceptively hard course.","It's pretty useful material, and the class is taught in a very easy, clear format.","it is really useful, but the beginning may seem directionless and dry"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["A good class! Psets are easy (and short) but don't really prepare you for the tests, which are surprisingly difficult.","This could be a great course if it's revamped next year.  Dasgupta is a good lecturer but the course lacked structure and it didn't seem like the teaching staff were overly invested in the course.","The homework load is relatively light but the concepts run deep and the methods are powerful.  to make sure not to be taken off guard by the exams, be sure to follow closely throughout the semester--it will be also be very intellectually rewarding.","Useful course, could be organized better.","Take good notes in class. Always go to class. Do your problem sets and do them again before midterm and final exam. Ask questions when needed.","Stat 131 has been one of the best classes I've taken here. The materials are very interesting and useful. Prof. Dasgupta is an excellent lecturer, and he's incredibly kind and helpful too.","for people simply wanting to learn how to interpret ACF plots and learn about software tools that can perform the analysis, this class is overkill as it delves into quite a bit of theory, i imagine more than a non-stats or math student could care for.","More theoretical than application. If you were interested in STAT111, take this course. If you feel sick of formula derivation, don't take.","Challenging but useful subject matter. While the book was wonderful, I learned very little from lecture.","Great class for Stat concentrators. This was one of my favorite stat classes and easier than some of the higher numbered ones. It is fairly interesting material, and isn't too difficult.","It's really, really, really boring.  Take it if you need to, but you either won't go to lecture or won't pay attention.  You won't do enough work during the semester and your cramming won't prepare you for the exams.","I was so lost throughout the entire class. Lectures were not engaging and it was very hard to learn from the professor. He assumes everyone understands the material and moves on quickly. Doesn't give very good examples in class and learning is probably more efficient from the textbook. Section was useful though.","This class is awesome! Tirthankar especially. The material in this class will help you understand data analysis for a different kind of model, and you will leave both empowered and more intelligent!","solid course, very useful knowledge but dont underestimate","This class is fun but not so easy.","time series is awesome!  though it's much harder than stat 110 to get help","Solid class. The materials covered are very useful. However, because there was only one TF (who's still pretty great), the logistics didn't run as smoothly as most other classes.","The course is very good."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.74","workload":"2.22","difficulty":"3.29","recommendation":"3.82","enrollment":"53","response rate":"86.79","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 131","course_id":"4835","cat_num":"8291","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"16","4s":"11","5s":"14"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 131","course_id":"4835","cat_num":"8291","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"24","4s":"14","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 131","course_id":"4835","cat_num":"8291","1s":"5","2s":"28","3s":"12","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
