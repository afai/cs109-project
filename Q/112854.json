The section is also relatively small (about 10), so you get to be great friends with your section-mates."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It really is a great survey of the Russian news media as well as a language class.The translation work is challenging. It really is a different kind of Russian than the one you learn in regular language classes. It will feel immediately useful to have taken the class and you will then be able to navigate the Russian press with much more ease and competence.","This course offers a great opportunity to learn about dynamic economic, political and social issues in Russia, while also significantly improving one's reading and listening comprehension.","Professor Pokrovsky is a patient instructor who makes students comfortable to try and participate. Her enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious.","Particularly useful if reading\/scanning Russian newspapers is required for research purposes. This course aided my reading of Russian newspapers immeasurably.","Natalia Pokrovskaya is wonderful!"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Professor Pokrovsky is very enthusiastic and helpful, was very accommodating to lower level speakers."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This course gives you lots of practice in reading, speaking, listening, and writing.","This class differs from lower-level classes in that it emphasizes reading and less structured speaking. The reading and the vocabulary is timely and important.","This a fun class to take, especially if you are interested in reading Russian newspapers.","Natalia Pokrovsky is the best thing you can do for yourself if you want to learn Russian.
