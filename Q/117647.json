It was easier, but that allowed me to sink more time into really trying to learn the math.

Even if you don't have the background necessary, if you're willing to put in some additional time, you'll probably be able to keep up with the course, and it can be a great source of ideas for independent study and theses.","Matveev is a god.","These tutorials are a great way to get to look at some interesting material that you don't necessarily get to see in the mainstream math courses."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Take it very seriously.
