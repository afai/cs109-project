The hands-on microscopy experience that this course offers is by far its greatest asset.  Having the ability to apply the theory taught in lecture to a project of significance gave me a much deeper understanding the course material than I have gained in my previous science courses (especially the large lecture courses).  I also couldn't believe the level of interaction I was able to have with both of the professors in this course.  For the first time in my career at Harvard, I felt as though the teaching staff really cared that I was learning what was being taught in lecture and that I was gaining valuable skills.  Dr. Lichtman's microscopy lectures were very helpful when it came time to actually use the microscopes, and Dr. Garner's historical perspective on cell biology was quite interesting (though some biology topics were given more attention than others).  Overall, this has been one of my best course selections so far in my two years at Harvard, and I highly recommend it to future students.","Fun class. A little bit disorganized as it was the first year, but projects and final presentation are rewarding. I'm sure it will be better next year, especially since professors and preceptors are very involved and invested in this class and the students.","Definitely take this course if like lab work more than theoretical questions!","If you enjoy the process of scientific discovery by looking at different things under the microscopes, then definitely take this course! You will get to use some of the most advanced microscopes at Harvard, and by the end of the course, you will be trained to be better microscopists that most graduate students."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 68","course_id":"11036","cat_num":"11556","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 68","course_id":"11036","cat_num":"11556","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 68","course_id":"11036","cat_num":"11556","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
