Chaplin is a good professor but Shuichi contributed very little. Seeing as he was the one grading the work, it seemed unfair. The feedback I received did not help me develop as a historian.","This class can make you a better writing in history, but you might not learn that much about environmental history beyond a few obvious definitional issues.","This is a good class, and Prof. Chaplin is a great professor, but at the end of the day this is tutorial and won't be the most stimulating class you take at Harvard.","There were a few gem readings, but most of the readings were quite bland and monotonous. I don't think that the course fulfilled its potential. However, class is purely discussion-based, which is refreshing!","A lot of writing assignments...but a good opportunity to improve writing","I would recommend this class to future history concentrators, because Environmental History is a new and interesting field, which makes the many paper assignments a little more interesting.","This was the first year of the new tutorials, so I know that they will get better. I really like Professor Chaplin, but I thought at times discussions were a bit fluffy. A lot of the people in the class didn't seem to engaged with the material, but this could have just been an isolated case for this year."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"2.90","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"2.80","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 97d","course_id":"10920","cat_num":"45123","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 97d","course_id":"10920","cat_num":"45123","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 97d","course_id":"10920","cat_num":"45123","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
