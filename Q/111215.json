'08":{"comments":["This is a great course for anyone with interest in developmental biology. The professors all put in a significant amount of time and energy into maintaining a good balance between basic developmental concepts and recent work in the field."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This is a great course for students with limited knowledge of development to gain a thorough understanding of the main topics of current developmental research and a familiarity with the techniques used to study development in vertebrates.","Aside from the fact that you'll learn an incredible amount about development,  you'll also have a lot of fun reading the great variety of papers and discussing them in section.  The section really makes this course a must take."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Great class, very thorough introduction to vertebrate developmental biology and more importantly to the patterns, pathways, and principles used over and over during development"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class is most beneficial if you are interested in ALL aspects of development, from limb development to neurodevelopment. If you are interested in only a certain area of development, a lot of this class may seem uninteresting.","The workload is a little bit high (discussion of two papers per week, two proposals). But it's a very valuable class. The instructors are enthusiastic. And it really makes me appreciate studies of developmental biology.","It's really fun and interesting! It's also a lot of reading, writing, and presenting material, so be prepared for that.","I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in a topic related to developmental biology. Although the class will probably cover several topics that are outside the student's interest, all developmental biology fields are somehow related and the principles found in one topic can be likely found in another. It is for the students' advantage to familiarize themselves with some of the main topics in developmental biology. In particular, the class enjoys the participation of an amazing array of senior faculty teaching in their areas of expertise. In addition, students have the opportunity to interact directly with them in the section portion of the course, in which two interesting papers are discussed almost every week. This is a very mature class as one would expect from a graduate level course. There are no nonsense midterms or final exams, but every assignment is an opportunity to grow academically. Feedback on assignments is first class.","This class does require a lot of reading and preparation, and proposal writing, but it is worthwhile in the end.  Take advantage of the sections and the knowledge of all the professors who are willing to facilitate the discussions.","It's a great course that gives a good big picture look at vertebrate development.  It does requre a steady amount of work all semester, though.","This course is very useful if you want to do research in the field of development or regenerative biology."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This was one of the best biology courses I have taken.  Even if you're only somewhat interested in developmental biology, I highly recommend taking this course.","A thoroughly enjoyable and interesting class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Great overview of development, and the professors are great!","This class will help you develop as a scientist and serve as an important bonding experience between you and the other dev-bio students in the BBS program. There is also extensive interaction with top-notch dev-bio faculty on a weekly basis.","This was an absolutely fantastic course, you truly build an understanding of state of the art understanding of vertebrate developmental biology. One of the most educational courses I have ever taken.","This class goes past the end of classes and requires a lot of work, but is still really interesting if you want to learn about the genetics of development in vertebrates. Really amazing class, but difficult."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELLBIO 207","course_id":"3011","cat_num":"2044","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELLBIO 207","course_id":"3011","cat_num":"2044","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELLBIO 207","course_id":"3011","cat_num":"2044","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
