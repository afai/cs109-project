Like any other course at Harvard, the value you get out of this course is directly proportional to the amount of time you invest in it.","If you do not have a strong knowledge of written French, do not take this class.  Additionally, there is a huge grad student presence (make of this what you will).","You may not emerge with as much knowledge as you'd expect though you will certainly see the gastronomical world through a different lens. Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading.","This class began a something that seemed reasonable and interesting, but by the end of the semester, when it seemed that the professor had lost all patience, the syllabus had been mangled beyond recognition, and when various uncertainties in the course had finally been clarified, the course became really unpleasant.","This class was new, and I was hesitant to take it, but afterwards, I came out with mixed feelings. This class was tough: the biggest hindrance: unorganized structure. We got assigned about anywhere between 200-400 pages of readings a week, but only ended up talking about 20%. Be aware that for the test, you're expected to know all of the material, but in reality, only had to know the 20% that you talked about, but isn't fun trying to cover all of the readings, even with study groups. I didn't like how slowly we got back response papers, which you're expected to write every other week. It would make sense if you got the previous one back in your off-week, so you can improve, but no. I got back like 3 at a time, (month and half's worth), and did not have a chance to improve on them. The end of the semester was rough with a second midterm, a semester long project, and a paper about the project. This will be different in your year, but the grad students dominated the conversation. I hate to be a pessimist, and there were some positives. Kathryn is awesome, and the material is genuinely interesting learning about the way the French people wrote about food in accordance with the respective revolutions and regimes. And I did learn a lot about the culture, and the importance of terroir through my final project. But be ready to read and work. It's not as hands-on as I thought it would be, and it's a challenge, but one that you're maybe willing to try.","A heavy reading load, but interesting subject matter, readings, and professor."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"4.00","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRENCH 127","course_id":"11102","cat_num":"63702","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRENCH 127","course_id":"11102","cat_num":"63702","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRENCH 127","course_id":"11102","cat_num":"63702","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
