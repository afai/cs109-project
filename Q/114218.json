But I would also caution that this is probably not the best course for those serious language learners who want a thorough grounding in grammar and the logic of the language; those students would be better off taking bibical hebrew instead.  I would also point out that, perhaps inevitably, this is a very pro-Israel and Israel-centric class; for those uninterested or uncomfortable with the idea of an uncritically pro-Israeli perspective, and for those uncomfortable with the injection of politics into the classroom (particularly, into the language class) this will not be an easy course to take.  I would make sure that future students know that this is certainly not only a Hebrew language class; in the teacher's own words, it is also an Israel-appreciation class.","A lot of fun, but if you aren't into learning languages (like me) then it is a good bit of work.","If you want to learn Hebrew, this is the way to do it. Probably the best course with which to fulfill a language requirement.","This class is a lot of fun, the teachers are great.

It's not fast-paced and it's not hugely rigorous, but it is certainly a good, fairly relaxed class.\r\nIf a student is interested in studying Hebrew intensively, I would likely recommend that he or she talk to the department directly rather than enrolling in this course, as the pace might be frustratingly slow for such a student.","This class is very fun and interesting, and Irit is a great instructor. she is nice and funny.","I would tell students to expect to have a lot of fun learning Hebrew.  They will have to work hard, but it will be worth it.","It's so much fun and you'll learn a lot.","Anyone who is thinking of learning Hebrew should definitely take this.","Hebrew is a lot of fun and you also get a lot of attention because it's not a conventional language and there aren't a ton of other students."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Fun, painless, great way to learn a bit of hebrew.","The class is unstructured and the textbook is useless.

The class itself doesn't demand the level of knowledge of Hebrew that I, at least, expect of myself, so if you want to get a really good knowledge of Hebrew, I would say prepare to study the extra vocab. and grammar that you're not really expected to know in class.  You can get a lot of class, and even more by studying on your own beyond the course requirements.  Also, finding a way to practice speaking would be helpful, since the amount of speaking in the course is somewhat slim.","I would tell them it is fun and accessible to any beginner.","Learning how to read, write, and speak Hebrew requires devotion to studying the language and a willingness to wake up for 9am class all year."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It's really fun, and Irit is the nicest teacher at Harvard!

Even though it was at 9:00 in the morning, it was always energetic and funny.  I got to be friends with my classmates and always felt that Irit cared about me as an individual.  We did a huge variety of activities - the guest speakers and out-of-class events, for instance, really added to the class.  The class was not work-intensive - there was enough work for me to really learn the material but not so much that I ever felt overwhelmed, and I took Hebrew as my fifth class this semester.  In general, if you're interested in the subject, there's NO REASON NOT to take Elementary Modern Hebrew B!","Its a good course and the professor is great but it requires a lot of focus","This is probably one of the funnest and yet most education language courses you can possibly take. I walked in not knowing ANYTHING...literally nothing about the alphabet, the language, the culture, and honestly, I sit there with my Israeli army friends and when they have a conversation I can honestly understand at least 60% of what they are saying. Take it, you'll love it.","It was really fun, and Irit is a delight!","The weekly tests are hard, and you will have to study a LOT. If you don't know any hebrew, be prepared to work harder than your classmates to try and keep up. PRofessor aharony is great, and you will absolutely adore her. She is lenient with grades. The class is fun, but tests are hard.","This is the funnest language to learn, with the funnest teacher.","I could not imagine a better language course."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["I would recommend this course to anyone who had previously studied a bit of Hebrew - either in Hebrew school or in Israel.  Irit is a wonderful teacher, and this course won't disappoint you.  I would also recommend the course to beginners with the reservations I've stated above.  In order to benefit from the course, beginners would need to meet the following conditions: a) have a lot of time to spend on the course; b) have incredible energy and enthusiasm for catching up with the other students; c) be good at languages.  A total beginner who is bad at languages will not excel in this course.  For this very reason, most of the beginners dropped out in the first three weeks of the class.","If you do know a bit of Hebrew going into the class, be ready for the pace to pick up quickly after a week or two! Don't let the jump catch you by surprise! Study the vocabulary! Study the vocabulary! Early and often! The class is tons of fun.","The teaching staff is great and your vocabulary grows at a fast rate.","This class is a lot of fun - but they have made it harder than it has been in the past.  There is a constant stream of work, but as long as you keep up with it, you'll do fine."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["While it is quite a bit of work, you shouldn't be scared away by that.  The grading is such that you will do fine, so long as you put forward a reasonable effort.","Learn the alphabet before class begins.","Despite the reservations I expressed about the course's workload and its level, I still recommend this course with enthusiasm.  Irit is a wonderful teacher - one of the best you'll find at Harvard.","Irit is a wonderful teacher, but this course is a lot of work!  Make sure to stay on top of assignments and you'll really enjoy it.","Great class. Professor Aharony is fantastic.","1) Do the homework. On time. Although it is generally fine if you turn it in late. But the professor is awesomely nice, so do not take advantage of her niceness if you can avoid it!\r\n2) Great class in general. Enjoy yourself. Don't worry, you are learning.\r\n3) Study the vocabulary as early in the week as possible to avoid late Thursday nights! Make flashcards and carry them around with you (I wish I had done this). Use the vocabulary of the week in your journal entries - this will contextualize it. Also, don't let go of the vocabulary from previous weeks - you will need it!","Irit is wonderful, and you really learn a lot of Hebrew."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["If you don't already know Hebrew, be prepared to work very hard to keep up at the beginning.  It does get better, though, after the first month or so.","This is an amazing class that offers a moderately challenging, exciting, fun way to learn a great deal of useful modern Hebrew.  This also will help you understand some biblical Hebrew.","Modern Hebrew B is an incredibly fun introduction to the language. The class is very engaging, involving a lot of singing and reading out loud. The workload is quite manageable.","It is a wonderful class. If you're interested in Hebrew or Israel, then take this course.","You will learn a lot in this course, whether you have no Hebrew background at all or came in with a little bit.  Depending on what you already know, your required effort will vary, but everybody leaves the same class at a similar level.","Irit and Osnat do a great job of getting a class of people, some of whom did not even know how to read Hebrew in the beginning of the semester, to speak in Hebrew from day one.  They are both fantastic instructors and class is always a pleasant and often fun place to be.","Irit is incredibly nice and this class is so much fun!","A lot of students came into the class knowing a good amount of Hebrew, so it would be helpful for incoming students to have at least learned the alphabet and some of the basics. Also, Irit is a lot of fun!","It will be really fun, and you'll learn a lot.","I love this class.  Hebrew is one of the most interesting languages in the entire world.","This is DEFINITELY the foreign language class to take at Harvard! Hands down!","This class is not too much work and a lot of fun, and the teacher is lovely.  We learn a song in Hebrew every week, and learn vocabulary and grammar from the songs (as well as separately).  There are weekly quizzes but they're not stressful at all.  By the end of one semester you will be able to write a page in Hebrew fairly easily, and speak and understand simple sentences."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Best language class you could ever take at Harvard! I've often heard my classmates complain about something to do with spanish\/arabic\/italian, etc, but I've never heard anyone complain about hebrew. It was such a treat to go to class every day.","This is a great course.  Don't be scared off if you can't read Hebrew going into the class.  It's intimidating at first, but it does get better.","Really fun class, and the nicest teachers ever!","If you have any language requirement to fulfill at Harvard, Modern Hebrew B is the way to go.  I recommend this course with enthusiasm.  Irit would bring in food on holidays, we would sing almost everyday (Israeli songs are very catchy), and Irit was a like a mother at Harvard.  I loved the TFs too and having the chance to converse with them regularly.  I would definitely recommend this course.","If you have zero previous exposure to Hebrew, it will probably be difficult for the first couple months, so be prepared to feel behind the rest of the class, but also willing to put in a little extra work.","This class is not too difficult if you have a bit of background, and if you don't, with hard work, you will soon catch up to those who have a strong background.  It is a lot of fun, Irit is one of the best teachers you will have at Harvard, and it is an excellent way to fulfill a requirement.","This class is fun, and you will learn a lot -- by the end of the first year, you'll be able to write a short essay in Hebrew and carry on a conversation.  Irit is wonderful and very helpful -- I had a class that conflicted with Hebrew second semester and she met with me every week to go over all the material I'd missed.","Irit was a great professor, lots of fun with a dry sense of humor.  She had us speaking Hebrew from day 1, and did a good job of balancing a class where some students came in with lots of prior knowledge, and some could not even read Hebrew. We sang every day, and she fed us a lot! Osnat was also really helpful in section.","Irit gives so much love to this class.  What a wonderful learning experience!","Modern Hebrew B is an incredibly fun and engaging course. Not only do you learn a language, but you also get to know all of your classmates. The course is very rewarding.","it's a great course, and you will develop significantly"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Knowing a little Hebrew helps tremendously. If you don't get ready to work more than your classmates but don't worry too much because Irit is the most understanding.","Irit is one of the most wonderful professors I've had at Harvard. If you have ANY interest at all in Hebrew, or even if you just need to fulfill a language requirement, TAKE HEBREW! She's amazing."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Fantastic class, Irit is AMAZING"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I don't care how useless you think this is, you will learn to love Jewish culture and the Hebrew language :)","Irit is an absolutely amazing professor who teaches really well and is always willing to accommodate your schedule and offer extra help.  She usually seems more like a nice aunt than a professor. You also get a really good foundation in Hebrew, even after just one semester. I already feel like I can carry grammatically correct conversations in Hebrew! The only downside I have with the class is that it meets so often--every day plus one section a week, and that sometimes class can be a bit boring (but that's probably necessary to learn Hebrew properly).  I would DEFINITELY recommend this class.","Learn a lot of language without getting bogged down by too much grammar.","First, let me say that after 14 weeks I went to speaking NO Hebrew to speaking in Hebrew at length with the professor's family, writing short essays and composing many letters. The proof is in the pudding.\r\n\r\nAs to the professor, Irit is a real mom, and in this course she will be your mother. Now, she won't baby you or wipe you, but she will use everything within her power to keep you up to speed. She is very perceptive, and she will figure out what your weaknesses are. These qualities combined with her enthusiasm make you appreciate what she is trying to accomplish with the material (textbook, songs\/lyrics, worksheets, stories).\r\n\r\nGet into her class and learn to speak some Hebrew, yo.","Excellent language course. You begin to learn real, spoken, everyday Hebrew. Irit is simply wonderful. Five days out of the week, your day begins in a great way.","This is a really fun class! The professor is wonderful.","The best language course I've ever taken, anywhere.","This class is very fun and Irit is amazing! It is a great language to pick up with no prior experience and the work load is manageable with quizzes on Friday. I would definitely recommend this class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou will be very surprised as to how much material you learn in just a semester!","This is an amazing class! Irit is the warmest, kindest and generally best instructor that I have had at Harvard. Her passion for Hebrew makes the learning experience fantastic--I have learned so much Hebrew over this past semester (I was a complete beginner). Irit manages to create a very comfortable setting for speaking Hebrew and the assignments are perfect in scope, variance et cetera. I highly recommend everyone to take this class, even if just as a fun elective.","Irit's friendly, supportive, knowledgeable teaching makes this class a joy. Learning a new language is no walk in the park, and students should be prepared to take this every-day-at-10-a.m.-homework-every-night-talk-in-class-every-day commitment seriously. But if Irit's teaching it, it's worth your while.","I knew absolutely no Hebrew going in and I am very happy with my progress. It was tough getting started, but things became more manageable. I think it is a necessity to put in at least an hour of solid studying everyday after class, I started doing this a few weeks in and I saw my performance shoot up."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Irit is a wonderful teacher who really cares about her students","Take it! Irit is awesome, Hebrew is fun -really-, and you will learn more than you would hope for a beginner. Being able to read and communicate after a just one year of language is really rare. I don't think you will have the opportunity to learn Hebrew that quickly, and that pleasantly as at Harvard.","This was such a fun course. Irit is fantastic and an extremely dedicated teacher. I learned a lot of Hebrew without having no prior knowledge at all.","I'm going to Israel and I'm confident in the Hebrew I've learned- I know lots of songs, history, and I've learned so much beyond grammar. Irit is wonderful and encouraging. Highly recommended.","This class is amazing. I would seriously recommend taking it. Irit is the absolute best, and you learn so much Hebrew in one year. Irit makes class really enjoyable--we sing some days, and she's really funny even when we're just learning stuff like grammar and vocabulary. Definitely take Hebrew! You also don't need any Hebrew background to do well in this class, even though some people have a bit coming in.","Great and fun way to learn a lot of Hebrew quickly.","Irit is an incredible teacher who brings so much enthusiasm to the class. We sing and have fun in class and move pretty quickly through the material. Overal, if you are interesting in Hebrew I would definitely take this course because it is a beginner level course and taking it with Irit is just the best!","The best language course I've ever taken (and I've taken half a dozen!).","As an RLL concentrator, I have taken many language courses at Harvard and this one outdoes them all by far. Irit is a great instructor and the amount of Hebrew you will get out of this course is unbelievable. You will come out able to communicate basic ideas in perfect Hebrew.","One will naturally take this course after the first semester, and then you are certainly prepared. Irit is an incredible teacher and human being, definitely take this course."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Definitely take this class if your looking for a basic but thorough introduction to the Hebrew language.","If you are enthusiastic about languages and the cultures surrounding them, take this class! Irit is a great professor. She really cares about your progress and is an open book.","This class is great. It is very fun and rewarding and I definitely learned a lot. Take it even if you're not Jewish or even if you don't have a great interest in Israel...if you appreciate languages and learning than you'll like this class. It is very interesting to learn a language completely from scratch and Hebrew is such a beautiful language!!!","If you have ever been interested in learning Hebrew or think you will ever be interested in the future, I highly recommend this course. You'll have more fun in this class than in any other you take this semester, meet interesting people, and learn so much. Another thing to note is that my experience of the class has been really interesting and diverse: people chose to learn Hebrew for all different reasons. Some are Jewish and some are not, but the diversity reaches even farther than that. It makes for a really enriching learning experience that you don't necessarily get in a lot of language or other kinds of classes.","irit makes learning Hebrew very enjoyable and dynamic. In addition, she invites Israeli speakers on a variety of arts and culture topics that contribute to making this language learning a transcendent course in culture, which a language course naturally is.","Prepare to get confused if you know nothing of Semitic languages, and even more so if you do, but trust that you will learn something by the end of the day.","Irit is a great professor and a great person. This class takes a lot of time and energy, to keep up with the material, but it's a great course and the work is very do-able and very worth it. Also the guest speakers\/lecturers are really cool.","If you need a language requirement, take this! It's really enjoyable AND you will learn."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Irit is an amazing professor. She is very warm and open, and we learn an impressive amount. Having guest speakers come from Israel meant that this was not just a language course. It was a channel into an entire culture and the passions, problems, and pursuits of that culture.","AMAZINGAMAZINGAMAZING","This is a fantastic course with a great professor, probably one of the best language courses at Harvard in my opinion, definitely take it if you're interested, no matter your background. The more diverse the group of students is the better and more interesting the class is","Irit is fantastic and you will learn a lot of Hebrew very quickly. It requires a huge amount of work though.","This class is a great for its use of technology and exposure to different students across Harvard (from grad to undergrad) in an intimate setting.","This course and the instructor have all the tools to make anyone successful in this language but you need to give it time.","This is a wonderful introductory language class. You will be amazed at how much you learn."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["A great course. Whether you're a Jew looking to better understand your identity and\/or place in the world, a budding linguist, a Middle East enthusiast, or anything in between, you'll get good, high quality instruction from a very smart, very kind lady.","You learn so much in this course.  It's really incredible.  I came in with no prior knowledge whatsoever I cannot begin to describe just how much I've learned about Hebrew, its origins, and the culture of those who speak it.","This is a great class. You learn a lot of Hebrew very quickly in a relatively enjoyable environment. That said, it is a very difficult class because of the pace (you'll have about 60 vocab words to learn each week), the workload, and how different Hebrew is from English, so be prepared to work hard.","This class is incredible! It is honestly one of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard. I've been able to read\/write in Hebrew for years, but I've always wanted to be able to speak and understand it. This class is perfect for that. I really feel like I'm learning so much and like I can actually hold a conversation, even after just one semester. Irit makes this class so special. She is so encouraging and has a fantastic teaching style\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe really cares about all of us and making sure that we all learn. This class has a pretty familial atmosphere, which especially in the usual stress of Harvard is really wonderful. The workload is also quite minimal, with less than half an hour of work on most nights. The weekly quizzes might seem a bit daunting, but I found them to be really helpful in forcing us to stay on top of the material. I honestly can't recommend this class enough. If you are remotely interested in studying Hebrew, take this class!!","I have taken many language classes and taught language myself, and this class was the best one I've ever taken, the most engaging.","Absolutely hands-down the best language class taught at Harvard. Irit is a gem and an amazing  teacher and person. You will feel loved, you will learn SO much, and you will have a great time doing it.","If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in the language, I highly recommend this class. I had been wanting to learn Hebrew for years, and I had to decide between continuing my Spanish education or starting new with Hebrew. I think I made the right call. The class forms a little community. Everyone who takes it wants to be there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpeople may take it to fulfill the language requirement but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a class people take to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get through.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Irit is so lovely and fun. She wrote the course material, so she knows it really well and the curriculum flows really well. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need prior Hebrew to take the class, but know that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unfamiliar with the alphabet and reading Hebrew you will need to put in lots of hours the first few weeks (some kids enter the class with a basic knowledge of the alphabet and how to read). The class is fast paced, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get behind. Stay on top of vocab and review throughout the semester. Love this class.
