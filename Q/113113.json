Unless you're somehow really into Machiavelli.","This is an excellent course. The lectures are clear, the professor is enthusiastic, and it is easy to make thematic connections between different weeks' material. I would highly recommend taking this class if you have any interest in American history or democratic theory.","Even though the lectures rambled on sometimes, Professor Muirhead's lectures were often inspiring and always thought-provoking. Also, John Harpham's section was incredibly efficient and interesting. My favorite class at Harvard so far.","Cool idea, but the class wasn't organized that well. Hard to follow the lectures, hard to make sense of what exactly the professor wants us to take out of the class. The assignments weren't difficult, especially the paper assignment, but I didn't think the midterm format was very fair - quote IDs (where you simply identify the title of the world) and an essay. Since you aren't really held accountable for the reading regularly, you really have to put in a lot of your own time if you want to get a lot out of this.","Professor Muirhead is by far the most engaging lecturer I have encountered at Harvard so far. If he returns, take anything and everything that he teaches!","One of the best courses I've taken as a Gov concentrator. Muirhead is quite possibly the best lecturer I've encountered at Harvard.","Really fantastic course. Great material that everyone should read. Both Prof. Muirhead and John were super accessible and you could tell really cared about the material. Sections and assignments were engaging!","Take it! It is fascinating material, very sweet TFs and professor who genuinely care about their students and helping them succeed.","Muirhead is a superb lecturer, the content of the course is really interesting, and the readings are both super interesting and not terribly necessary to doing well in the course, making them perfect \"put off until reading period and then actually enjoy them\" material. If this course is offered again, definitely take it.","Have a fundamental knowledge of political philosophy prior to entering this course, otherwise you will be slightly disadvantaged.","While Prof. Muirhead is well-intentioned, the exceptional\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalmost enthusiastic\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddisorganization of the class contributed to a profound sense that the material was random, and the assignments and grading were arbitrary. For instance, it was only less than 36 hours before the final that the format of the exam was actually distributed, which if nothing else simply seemed frankly disrespectful to hard-working students trying earnestly to do well.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, lectures frequently had no obvious connection to the readings, and would have benefited tremendously from outlines or other materials distributed to students. It was rarely, if ever, clear what we were supposed to have gained from a given week. This could have been a great class, but I was extremely disappointed.","This was one of the best courses I've ever taken. It was certainly the best set of lectures. Professor Muirhead is an incredible lecturer. Though it was eventually revealed that he has strong political leanings, he was able to present each of the authors' ideas as if they were his own. The readings were concise and on point. The discussions were great, and often got heated. I took this class as a complete elective senior spring, and I am so glad I did!","Muirhead is a phenomenal lecturer - honestly one of the best teachers I have had at Harvard","I would not have taken this course if I still did not need to fulfill my theory requirement for gov, and I would caution students to SHOP IT FIRST and make sure that you can sit through the lectures without surfing the internet or falling asleep or both. The professor literally stands there and just talks at you for an hour, and sometimes it is really hard to remain engaged with what he is saying. All in all, if you are a person who really likes political theory then go for it. If not, this may not be the course for you.","If Professor Muirhead returns from Dartmouth tot each this course again, take it! It was a painless way to spend a semester with American political theory. Professor Muirhead  wove in the right amount of philosophy, history, and discussion of current events to make this an enjoyable course regardless of one's interest in political thought. The TF's, John and Sergio was outstanding as well! Great way to fulfill the political thought government requirement.","I absolutely loved this course. It was one of the most enriching, meaningful academic experiences I've had at Harvard, and I wish Prof Muirhead would be around to continue teaching it. It made me understand the basis of this country, both at its founding and today, in a very new way. Muirhead is charismatic, brilliant, and honest with his opinions and interpretations of thinkers, and I now think about the principles of this nation in a context he illustrated over the semester.","Do not hesitate, take the class. There is no way you will regret it.","If you can take this course with Russ Muirhead, do it. Even if you can't, it will be worth your while to attend a few lectures.","Great lecturer, but does not use slides so it gets easy to become a little lost. Midterm quote IDs were terribly difficult, but it seems they learned their lesson for the final and made the quotes more manageable.","Keep up with the readings over the course of the semester (good amount of reading, but it's all interesting) and go to lecture. Prof. Muirhead clearly loves what he's teaching and is extremely engaging!","Good subject and interesting reading. Only some reservations because of lecture - no handouts, PowerPoints, or anything to help you follow along.","Incredible class. I wish Professor Muirhead taught here at Harvard permanently. The lectures amazingly felt very structured and spontaneous at the same time. John was one of the best TFs I've had at Harvard, leading great class discussions and giving excellent feedback on assignments. Of course, the course material is really enjoyable if you're interested in American history and political theory in general.","The class is not an easy gem, but it's also not incredibly difficult. The great thing about it is that it requires you to do the reading because of the way the exams are structured. But if you actually do the readings, which you end up having to do, you will get a ton from this class. I am leaving a more thoughtful and more informed person because of this class. Definitely worth taking.","This was an extremely accessible and engaging class! Prof Muirhead is an excellent lecturer and his lectures do a great job of supplementing course readings.","This is a pretty great class to fulfill your theory requirement for Government, especially if you're a big American history buff, like me. The reading list is great and it's definitely stuff you should get to know if you want to feel more American. It's a relatively straightforward class with a midterm, a paper and a final. Lectures are hit and miss.","This class is an extremely easy, intro-level and accessible survey of, as the title suggests, the history of american political thought. If you already can tell if a Federalist Paper was written by Madison or Hamilton by looking at the structure of the argument, you should not take this class as you will be stupendously bored. If you, on the other hand, didn't know that Madison and Hamilton were two of the main authors of the federalist papers, you should definitely take this class. Think of it as \"History of American Politics 101\".","This class covered a lot of interesting material (excellently curated syllabus, and the book, American Political Thought, is filled with other good readings) but it did not generally cover it in a super clear way. The lectures could get really unfocused, and often I didn't fell like they helped me better understand the readings, especially since they usually only covered 1-2 readings of the 6-8 we had each week. Work requirements are reasonable. Prof. Muirhead is super passionate about the subject overall.","This course is the best course I have taken at Harvard! I was not looking forward to the political theory requirement, but this was a great course! Take this course if you like American politics\/history; you will love this course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"58","response rate":"72.41","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 1080","course_id":"10888","cat_num":"22788","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"8","4s":"7","5s":"24"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 1080","course_id":"10888","cat_num":"22788","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"27","4s":"7","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 1080","course_id":"10888","cat_num":"22788","1s":"10","2s":"25","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
