Lecture is crucial to understanding the concepts, so don't miss them.","Some interesting topics taught, but ultimately (and rather disappointingly) did not cover most of what was originally mentioned on the syllabus. I was hoping for a more application-based class, but it ended up feeling like more of a math\/stats class.\r\n\r\nAs a new class, it was quite disorganized at times. The textbook was not useful for much of the class and the lack of notes made it difficult to learn and understand parts of the course. I imagine in a future offering of this course, there will be posted notes for everything which will (hopefully) resolve this problem.\r\n\r\nAll of that being said, I think the class covers some really interesting and useful topics and will probably be much improved in a future offering. The teaching staff's great - everyone was really helpful, made themselves available with lots of office hours, etc. I'd shop this class and see how the first problem set goes before deciding.","Not only is this course an excellent introduction to biological signal processing applications and algorithms, but many of the ideas taught are applicable to non-biological problems as well. Anyone interested in a gentle introduction to a nice array of important signal processing algorithms would enjoy this course.","Lectures are a bit difficult to get through, but the knowledge and tools you walk away with are great.  You just have to be willing to put in the work to earn them.  If Paul is TFing the course again, don't worry if a lecture is confusing because he'll clear it right up.  Problem sets were really interesting and covered a lot of cool topics."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.83","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.17","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 155","course_id":"10585","cat_num":"63833","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 155","course_id":"10585","cat_num":"63833","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 155","course_id":"10585","cat_num":"63833","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
