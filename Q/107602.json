Holly is absolutely wonderful and her enthusiasm and kindheartedness are infectious. She has a genuine interest in the students' well-being and the subject matter. You'll look forward to going to lecture the two times a week-- it was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard. Also, the subject matter is one of the most applicable to real life as well. I would highly recommend this class!","This class is phenomenal. Minimal effort outside of class, but well worth taking. Learn SO MUCH about relationships and life in general, everyone should be required to take a course like this.","fun fun fun!","really interesting topic and an AMAZING professor. take this class","I often found myself thinking this class was too good to be true. I think a lot of people might write this off as some sort of 'joke class,' but if you actually attend lectures, you realize that they're informative, helpful, and some of the only ones that have any real-world application. Holly Parker has SO MUCH endless enthusiasm and truly loves what she's doing, and it's really infectious. Absolutely take the class, and understand that yes, it definitely leans on the 'easier' side -- who's complaining? -- but the content also pretty much constitutes the fabric of human existence, so it's also pretty worthwhile to be learning.","A very interesting class with applicable material and the sweetest teacher on the planet. It could benefit from more structure, visual aid during lecture, and more instruction on assignments. But given that it's the first year taught, these are pretty minor things. The class is not even remotely stressful and very much recommended","There are only 3 assignments in the entire course. None of them are difficult in any way. THe best advice I could give is to go to class, as lectures are intriguing and actually help you learn a lot about relationships.","Very easy class.  Holly is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  The subject of the class and most lectures are entertaining, but readings are a drag.","If you're looking for a rigorous treatment of interpersonal relationships, this is not the class for you. With that said, this class was an enjoyable break in my day, and its light workload definitely made me a happier and saner person. Holly is also just a great person, and her enthusiasm and understanding will make up for a lot of the weaknesses in the course.","This professor is amazing and this was the best class I have taken at Harvard so far. The class does not require a lot of work at all and it was one of the highlights of my week to interact with the professor.","Professor Parker is great. The only reservations I have is that the course doesn't ask enough of students. There is little motivation to actually do all the reading. If the syllabus changes, and a few more assignments are added than the three we had, I would recommend this course.","Dr. Parker is unbelievably nice and so welcoming as a professor. She willingly and openly engages with her students and is always so happy to be in class (she will openly profess how much she enjoys class every time!). The material itself is interesting because relationships apply to everyone in our everyday lives however since relationships are such a big part of our lives a lot of the material won't seem very 'new' or 'life changing' because we naturally know a lot about the psychology of relationships just by being in them! Nonetheless it was a fun class to enjoy at the end of the day and it was painless!","Holly is great! The course is fun and so applicable","Take this class. The professor, Holly Parker, is the most wonderful woman ever. She is so positive and happy in the most genuine and sincere way. She loves the topics she teaches about. It is also pretty easy--2 short paper assignments and 1 final paper. It's really interesting material.","Since this is the first year that Harvard teaches the class, a lot of the structural planning for this course has flaws. Section assignments were not finalized until late October (instructor did not use section planning tool.) Instructor does not prepare PowerPoint slides for our lectures, so you would have no idea what is being taught in the class unless you took notes or borrowed someone else's notes. Takes attendance to track \"participation\", which I personally don't think is a very good idea because we really don't have much incentives to really engage in lecture after we put our name down on the attendance sheet. The assignments in this class are really easy, significantly easier than my introductory psych classes. Most of the time students don't even do much other than showing up to class. Finally, I turned in my final paper with only my first assignment returned to me. I just wish I had more feedback before I started that final paper. That said, although a lot can be improved on this course, if you want an easy 5th class or a laid-back class to take while you write your thesis, this is a good choice for you. I guarantee you that you will feel absolutely stress-free taking this class.","Completely painless. Even the assignments are fun. There is no reason not to take this course","Take this class if you are looking for a cheap, but boring, A.  It's all common sense.","TAKE THIS COURSE. Even if it is not taught at a convenient time, take it. Seriously. I really hope Harvard keeps it around. I think about something I learned in this course everyday, and I try to apply it.","It is the best and most applicable class I have taken at Harvard so far and I am going into my second semester as a junior.","a very enjoyable and life applicable course!","This class is the best class I have taken at Harvard. I loved learning in this class because the subject matter is so related to real life. Also Holly is amazing.","This class is not at all demanding, but you definitely get out of it what you put in. If you have a bit of self-discipline and take time to learn the subject matter, you will greatly benefit.","Professor Parker is amazing! Get to know her if you can.","This class was phenomenal, but you'll need to be able to stomach some really crack-pot sounding psychology. It's actually all pretty legit, but the language around it can be silly. You need to attend lectures (it's a requirement) and they were at night my year, so beware scheduling.","This class will help you evaluate the nature and meaning of your relationships (romantic or friendship)and how you see yourself in relation to those relationships.","Such an easy way to fill a psych requirement. TAKE IT."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is a great course! It covers both theoretical and practical knowledge about close relationships!","A GIANT waste of time; lecture itself is very discussion based which means you listen to a lot of your peers offering overly personal\/unhelpful interpretations to themes in relationships...would have enjoyed more science for a semester long course like this. Would have been a great one-time guest lecturer. TFs are weirdly hard graders, yet the class is disorganized...don't take this...just read a self-help book or psycINFO \"close relationships\" to get more substantive knowledge.","Dr. Parker is amazing and this course changed my outlook on many things (including how I perceive my own happiness) and I feel that it is such a life skill building class. The assignments were all very interesting to write and I never found myself hating the writing process (which is a new one for me).","The class was very interesting and was one of the best psychology electives I have taken","Dr. Parker is the most genuine and caring Professor I have encountered at Harvard. Her enthusiasm for the material and for her students in infectious. Harvard tends to be a cold institution, but Dr. Parker is full of warmth. She  encourages and reinforces learning - a rare and very meaningful quality in a teacher. Thank you Dr. Parker.","This class is interesting and good if you need an easier class with a lighter work load.","This class is interesting if you put the work into it. If you are a science concentrator, the hand-wavy methods employed by relationship psychologists may annoy you. Otherwise, very easy. Good course to complement a heavy load.","Holly is such a sweetheart. She was the most down-to-earth, understanding, and considerate professor I have met throughout my undergraduate career. However, the topics tend to sound redundant week after another, and they are not that intellectually stimulating. Also, meeting at 7:30pm at night on Tuesdays and Thursdays was painful. But, you'll form new perspectives and a better understanding of your personal close relationships- which makes this class worthwhile.","Dr. Parker is wonderful, and it has potential to be interesting. However, it ended up being a lot of obvious material and redundant comments from students. I think it would be great in a discussion format, but it's pretty pointless as a lecture.","Great class. Easy, but the material is also very intriguing and interesting.","Dr. Parker is really an exceptional person. I can say that I have never met anyone like her, so it was a pleasure to be in the class just to learn from her stories and experiences. On the last day, she invited all the students to a restaurant, and she even cancelled classes after the Boston Marathon tragedy. The concepts taught in class are actually incredibly interesting--although at times it can be a little slow. I would encourage you to pay attention and listen carefully. I would also tell students to read the abstracts of the articles on the course website.","Sure, this is an easy class but there are (short) papers due every few weeks which can be annoying. What you put into it is what you get out of it. I found it hard to pay attention in lecture because it is a night class and Dr. Parker did not use slides. Her lectures are very stream of consciousness, it takes a long time to get the point across (with anecdotes) so it is hard to follow her overall main idea each time.","Very interesting content. You really learn a lot about close relationships and you will take away invaluable information that can be applied on a practical level.","Holly (the prof.) is amazing and really sweet.  She's really into the lecture material and gives really interesting lectures that integrate student discussion (it started as a seminar class and ballooned to like 75 people, but it still felt intimate).  Grading was pretty lenient and there are only 5 assignments (4 short essays, and one longer final paper, they're all really fun to write).  Most of the material does seem pretty common sensical, but it's backed up by literature and Holly does give some good theory every couple of lectures.","Professor Parker is amazing, and her lectures are truly a delight to attend, but the assignments are weird, and if you already have an interest in social psychology regarding relationships, it's unlikely that this class will teach you anything.","Do not take this class unless you are ok with a super disorganized class and absolutely need an A.","This course is great. You learn a lot of practical stuff about how to have excellent relationships. Holly (the professor) is amazing!","The material covered in this course is interesting and Holly is the best. She is really laid back and just wants everyone in the class to learn and have a good time. The papers are fine. Be prepared that the lectures end up being mostly Q&A and discussion-based rather than traditional lecture style.","This was probably the worst course I've taken at Harvard. This course has SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but all it is is Professor Parker rambling for an hour and half twice a week (except when she makes class optional or doesn't show up to lecture, which happened a total of four times). She doesn't use ANY visual aids, which makes it impossible to focus (and you have no motivation to read anything or pay attention because there are no exams, and the assignments are basically unrelated to lecture material). The TFs are totally incompetent and assign grades basically arbitrarily. There is an over-emphasis on little things like format and citations and not enough emphasis on content, which is what actually matters. That said, this class took almost no time and was extremely easy. But I don't think you should waste your time. Independently read a few journal articles on close relationships, and you'll learn more than what you'll learn in this class. Better yet, take Social Psych or Human Sexuality, both of which go into depth on close relationships and are a million times better in every way.","The topics covered in this class are fascinating. Professor Parker does a wonderful job facilitating class discussion. She also really cares about her students' progress. The material covered in this class can be applied in students' every day lives. The material is also highly relevant for anyone interested in pursuing a clinical profession (e.g. doctor, psychologist, social worker, nurse, etc).","This was class was really amazing but it definitely had its pros and cons. I don't usually take the time to write a lot in this section but I wanted to really take the time to do so because of my experience with this class. \r\n\r\nFirst thing that I think is REALLY important for future students to know is that enrollment for this class was MUCH higher than expected by Holly and TFs in general. The first say 100s of people showed up to a small room that could honestly fit no more than 15 people comfortably. This is because the class got such high reviews last year, but pre term planning only revealed like 15 were interested in taking it. This discrepancy led to massive diaorganization in the class.\r\n\r\nBecuase enrollment was so high, and Holly wanted to let everyone into the class (thank god otherwise I wouldn't have gotten in) she and the TF struggled a lot to have a stable\/organized format for everything. \r\n\r\nOne major flaw that I feel could have been addressed was the number of TFs. It is impossible for a class so big, to be succussful with just TWO TFS. Furthermore, one of the TF never, not once, showed up to lecture. I feel like they couldve gotten more TF and that would have solved so many problems, but once again this might have been hard given the weird timing of the class and the enrollment number.\r\n\r\nI also think that this class should have some optional and some required section (similar to PSY 15: Social Psychology) because section were nice to attend and I loved getting to know my TF, but sometimes I found the activities a little unnecessary given my psychology knowledge.\r\n\r\nPutting these issues aside however, I feel like the amazing parts of this class should be acknowledged. Holly is an amazing lecturer and such a nice person in general. Her enthusiasm for the material makes the timing so worth it!\r\n\r\nI have never learned so many things that are directly applicable to my life as I did in this class. Every reading, and every assignment provided an opportunity to learn not only avout myself but also about the people closest to me: friends, family, etc.\r\n\r\nBianca, my TF, was always so willing to help and I actually really bad at how overwhelmed she was with so many students. Her friendliness in section, feedback on assignments, and willingness to meet outside of class truly made the class for me. I know a lot of people will complain about her timilness on assignments, and disorganization in section, but people need to acknowledge everything I mentioned above. With the right number of sutdents (15-20) I am more than sure that Bianca would have been able to give each and every student the amount of guidance she gave me on assignments. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would HIGHLY reccomend this class, as I can anticipate a lot of the disorganizational aspects of it will be addressed in the following year.\r\n\r\nWow, I wrote a lot.","easy class. but haphazardly organized\/graded...... will you actually learn anything? who knows.","This class is interesting. You won't get a lot of concrete information to take away but Holly is entertaining.","This class was extremely easy, but so easy to the point that I did not really respect it as a class. The professor is amazing and friendly, but she allowed for people to ask random questions during class and lecture was extremely unstructured. Section did not really add to the class.","It's a good easy A (I think), but you might want to stab yourself in the eye while you earn it.","This course is one of the easiest I've taken at Harvard.  However, beware the quality of the teaching staff, because if you wind up with TFs who aren't on top of their game it'll be a real pain.  Holly is great and sweet and often engaging.  Just know that lectures are \"mandatory\" in that attendance is taken maybe a handful of times throughout the semester.  There are no exams and only a few short papers.  A great, low-commitment class with pretty useful material that you can often apply in real life.","First, the good: Professor Parker cares a lot about the students, and she is very flexible, understanding, and concerned with everyone's well being and success. However, lectures and sections feel like a complete waste of time (but they were mandatory!). The grading was almost comically arbitrary, and the feedback I got was confusing and confused. Further, the administration of the class was very rocky, at least at the beginning - sectioning took forever, getting grades back took forever, and it assignments deadlines kept getting delayed. While this might seem like a positive when an assignment gets extended, it just ends up making everything feel chaotic. The content of the lectures tended to be repetitive and very \"soft\"; I'm not sure I learned all that much. All in all, I would strongly recommend that you not take this class.","Easy peasy pumpkin squeezy","The course may have very interesting material but I think that my knowledge of the material wasn't expanded. Most of the \"advice\" is pretty common sense, at least in my opinion. Dr. Parker is extremely sweet, but her class was ridiculously unorganized. Sections didn't start until well into the semester, and were coordinated by a Doodle poll at one point. One section submitted assignments via dropbox, the other had to physically turn it in. If you can handle the disorganization of the class then you might be able to enjoy it, however I found it severely impeded my ability to do so.","Holly is passionate about this course and you should be too. The assigned articles are great and will teach you quite a bit about the field.","It's a very fun class, but not much in-depth discussion because section focused on figuring in-text citation and talking to each other. Great class for senior spring.","Professor Holly is incredibly kind and a great person to just kind of spend time with, but I think it would benefit from more structure.","Be prepared to have to generate your own sense of coherency to write notes","Favorite class I've ever taken at Harvard ever. Holly is AMAZING!! Just take the course to be friends with her, she is awesome and really generates enthusiasm and excitement for the material. Also she is an incredible human being, and actually cares about her students as people, not just as numbers like most other Harvard professors.","I took this course mostly for myself and I enjoyed it. :)","Holly is a warm, loving, dedicated instructor and human-being. Besides that, I honestly learned little in this course. There are several interesting models and ideas here and there, but for the most part the course consisted of common knowledge of how to make close relationships satisfying. It can be frustrating to sit through a lecture and leave wondering what the main takeaways were. The assignments weren't helpful either. All comments about poor organization are valid.","class is very easy but pretty disorganized","It had the potential to be fascinating but lots of the course was diluted by just hearing other students chatter about their love lives or ask random and very personally specific questions that weren't interesting. Hopefully in future years we hear more interesting content from Holly because she really has interesting things to say.","It's interesting, you will do well, there is not too much work","I don't know if you'll find another class that will be useful to every day of your life. The material is somewhat commonsense because if you interact with people, you'll have noticed the trends, but if you're willing to raise questions and delve deeper into the topics (like attraction and attachment), you'll come out learning a lot! Holly is a phenomenal lecturer and person. She truly cares about her students, has a great sense of humor, and creates a class environment that just feels comfortable for sharing and discussion. Section was a little dry, but this might depend on your TF. The assignments and readings don't take forever, and are really interesting. This class is one of those that \"you get out what you put in\" but not in terms of time--it's an emotional investment.","The professor is lovely, Bianca (TF) is great. It doesn't really feel like an advanced psych class, but the material is interesting (and teaches relevant, real-world applicable relationship skills) and it has some good refresher material re:writing psych papers","Lectures with Holly are fantastic, but the section component of the course is unnecessary and painful.","The lectures toward the end of the class are not as good.  Less organized and less interesting topics.","The topic is interesting but it falsely lures you in. This class teaches you about relationships but does not really incorporate \"hands-on\" learning (direct application). Learning about close relationships seems awesome, but a lot of the class is information that was just recently discovered and is more common sense that anything. Also, the time slot is a really tough time to have class. That being said, the material is still interesting, though there are quite a lot of readings. You do leave the class with a better sense of how relationships work.","Best class I've taken at harvard! Holly is wonderful--get to know her! The assignments are fun, not work. Lecture is interesting, section is fun!","It's pretty easy...but make sure you are good on writing proper citations","This course has extremely interesting subject matter. However, if you are looking to have a rigorous introduction to relationship psychology, you should checkout and read a textbook. This class is mainly for people who want an easy A. For those looking to take academically challenging advanced electives, you should look elsewhere.","What you take out of this class depends on you. It tests your maturity, really. There are no exams, so there is no pressure to take notes and study or do the readings (or even attending to lecture). But if you want to learn about relationships you have all the resources your need. Professor Parker is the nicest woman, very knowledgeable, and is available for all students. Some people think this class is too easy. It is easy because you are the one who decides how much you want to take out of it, there is no outside pressure.","Great class, really fun, professor is so nice and very understanding.  She's really passionate about the material and it's contagious.  Was pretty disorganized structurally but in terms of the class itself, was excellent and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun, easy, and low-key class.  Don't let the fact that it's at night discourage you...it's definitely worth it.","Fun class with low workload. Will get you thinking in practical and constructive ways about your own close relationships. Holly is so sweet, knowledgable, and easy to talk to."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Take this class! Such a fun course in a low pressure environment. The teaching staff is great and the assignments are fun to complete.","If you take this class, go to lectures.","Loved this class. Holly is great. The material is super interesting and the assignments were great too. TAKE THIS CLASS!","This was by far my favorite class of the semester. Holly is an amazing professor and I can honestly say, I'm going to miss her lectures. I enjoyed going attending class, even if it was late. I feel like I learned so much! Everyone should take this class.","You get more out of it by doing readings on time.","This class is amazing! Holly is such a great professor, and she cares so much about her students and the subject. This is one of those rare Harvard courses that teaches you valuable life skills. Absolutely take this, and go to class because it's so interesting and getting to know Holly is great. The assignments are fun and the prof and TF are always there to help you when you need. I had taken no psych classes before and this class was still great and well-taught.","Such a fun class with a great teaching staff.","It's easy and has really fun assignments. Holly is a doll, and the class is incredibly painless. It's also applicable to real life, though it can be hard to motivate yourself to go to late night lecture when none of the material is actually tested.","This class is very easy and great as a 5th class. You don't have much work, but you'll get as much out as you put in - if you do all the readings, they can be really interesting.","a class that teaches you about yourself and your social being with others.","BEST CLASS EVER.","Amazing course! Take it, it's worth your time","Best class I've ever taken at Harvard. One of the few classes where I A) learned things that I still remember after the course is over, and B) had fun!","I absolutely loved this class.  Holly gives great lectures and is always engaging her audience.  In the same light, Aubrey does the same in section.  I love the material that is discussed in this class and really enjoyed what each teachers had to say about the material.","This is a get out of it what you put into it course. The course was not particularly rigorous but it was very interesting. This is a low-stress course that allows you a lot of freedom and creativity in assignments.","This class is so enjoyable and interesting.  Holly does such a great job teaching, especially because she is so passionate about what she teaches.  The papers are not bad to write and the readings are interesting.","You learn from this course to the extent of how much effort you put into it. That is, if you don't do the readings, you get only a shallow perspective of close relationships, and you'd be clueless in lectures sometimes. If you do the readings and attend all the lectures, you'd have a true appreciation of what amazing progress people have made in the past few years in the field of relational psychology and rid yourself of misconceptions about false psychology beliefs often portrayed in the media. The course can be difficult or moderate, depending on your obsession with perfectionism and with your reading habit. It is not necessary to read every single detail of the readings' articles (research articles), but if you do, and you want to get to the bottom of things, then it's quite difficult. However, it is a manageable, and, particularly enjoyable course! Professor Parker is amazingly engaging and enthusiastic.","Take this class! The time isn't ideal, but it is really interesting and the papers are fun!","Do it for your friends","This class was my favorite this semester! I think I actually learned the most useful information from this class so far here at Harvard!","This course is awesome! Super easy but interesting and applicable to your every day relationships and interactions with others.","Holly is an incredible professor! She brings the most energy I have ever seen to a course and loves what she teaches. It is a fun course that teaches a lot of material about things that are relevant to our daily lives and interactions.","There's a lot of things to love about this class.  First, the teaching staff does not waste your time.  If they don't have anything interesting to talk about, they won't bore you with uselessness to take up time until the bell rings so to speak.  Second, this is honestly some of the most practical stuff you can learn here.  It applies to everybody in a big way.  Third, the things you'll discuss are legitimately interesting.  And finally, the class is easy.  Follow the instructions, submit the assignments, and you should do well.","Although the professor and TF are great people, this is a VERY easy class. Almost too easy.Take if you're looking for one that's not too serious.","Find what interests you by reading the articles and write your essays about those things.  Lecture is completely optional.","Great class TAKE IT!","A true gem of a class. Lots of take-aways as far as how to improve your relationships with others, whether they be platonic, romantic, working, or casual. Pay attention in lecture, glance over the readings (and there are not that many), and you are all set for the papers. Also, Holly is such a sweetheart! I highly recommend this class.","Interesting subject matter, not too much work until the final paper, an extremely passionate professor, relaxed section"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.30","difficulty":"1.90","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"68","response rate":"77.94","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1503","course_id":"4266","cat_num":"32801","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"16","5s":"27"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1503","course_id":"4266","cat_num":"32801","1s":"15","2s":"28","3s":"9","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1503","course_id":"4266","cat_num":"32801","1s":"40","2s":"9","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
