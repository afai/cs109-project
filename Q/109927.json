There is a lot of writing and the reading is very disconnected from that writing, but it isn't that hard.","The material in this course is very dry. Don't take it unless you already know you are genuinely interested in intellectual history. For me it was more philosophical and less historical. If History 97 is already a \"necessary evil\" as a concentration requirement, the most you can do to help yourself is to choose one on a topic you know you already enjoy. This is not a class for exploring new subjects because its focus is learning to write like a historian, and in my opinion it is easiest to write about a topic you find interesting. You will not be learning a great deal about intellectual history, but rather how to write about it.","class is very difficult and a ton of work, but does improve your writing - make sure to take a history 97 in a topic that interests you or else it will be hellish","As a history concentrator, you've got to take it. Even though intellectual history isn't my field, I felt that learning about this type of history has better equipped me to work with primary sources. The class is a consistent amount of work over the semester due to the 3 papers and the revisions, as well as the final paper. Just be ready to write a lot and know that the readings are only helpful for the first two papers, after which you're doing your own research. The TF made this class great--a big shoutout to Sarah!","This class is a hundred times more effective than Expos and intellectual history is a very fascinating field. Its breadth really allows one to push oneself in whatever direction one is interested in. I strongly recommend this section!","History 97 isn't the most fun class, but all concentrators get through it, and I think the new seminar format worked well. I think it would make more sense without a primary source research paper at the end\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's a lot combined with the other work.","This class is intense. The reading will be dry at times; do it anyway. The writing assignments are daunting in their frequency; you will survive them. You may not realize it as you are going through the course, but by the end of the semester, you will be a better writer and research, and you will know how to approach historical scholarship. The course does exactly what it sets out to do: it teaches you to engage with texts and material as a historian, not just as a student. The papers due at Sunday at 5 will ruin more than a few of your weekends; it's no fun, but it's only for a semester. Two hour classes are long, but the class discussions are compelling, and as a whole, the course material is fascinating."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"15","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 97b","course_id":"10918","cat_num":"20768","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 97b","course_id":"10918","cat_num":"20768","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"8","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 97b","course_id":"10918","cat_num":"20768","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"7","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
