Professor Guzeldere is wonderful. He is the most humble and kind genius I've ever met. If you are interested in Philosophy of Mind, this is a great chance to discuss the subject. You will not improve your writing in this course and you will not do very much work at all in this course. It's a bit like a graded Freshman Seminar.","Guven is awesome; a comprehensive introduction to the topic, with very little work.","You will not find another course that is better taught, more engaging, or accessible than this one.","This class is so much fun and really engages students with interesting and thought provoking questions. Definitely take it if you enjoy good discussion and engaging teaching.","This course is fascinating, fun, hardly any work (compared to other classes), and you will learn a lot. Next year it might be a lecture, but the seminar setting this year made it feel like the best freshman seminars are supposed to feel, which I think was invaluable. The readings were all intriguing and had a lot to teach, though they felt somewhat watered-down and one-sided at times. Perhaps there will be more in the future or Dr. Guzeldere will post more optional readings. I learned the most from and did the most thinking with other classmates, though, either by reading blog posts or in preparation for the debates, which were a lot of fun. We ate Turkish food at Dr. Guzeldere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house and generally kicked it, but also got to argue points that may have been left out over the semester, with more at stake than there ever was during class. The workload is totally manageable, with semi-weekly blog posts, one debate, a 6-page final paper, and one midterm. These all contributed well to my learning, and I felt like there could have even been more to do. The main downside of the course is that Dr. Guzeldere was not very responsive overall, never reacting to our blog posts and not giving us much feedback on our midterms (which were almost entirely essay-based). Also, class time was always too short, as we always had more to say, more to debate, more to cover, though this could be seen as a testament to the content and style of the class. All in all, take this class if you have any interest in any part of the Mind\/Brain\/Behavior side of things, if you need an less-demanding course, or if you want to get to know classmates. You will learn a lot, get to know people, and have a stress-free workload in the meantime. It was a big contributor to my happiness this semester.","Really interesting subject matter. The class was small, which gave it a nice seminar-type feel. That being said, the professor was difficult to reach out to and communicate with, and the class presentation was somewhat haphazard.","Prof. Guzeldere is great.  Class is casual but gives you an opportunity to think about really interesting questions (if you're interested).  Highly recommended.","It was a fine course, but it really is a course on philosophy of the mind.  We also had very cyclical conversations, which became tiring after awhile.  But the conversations could be pretty good."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Keep an open mind about all viewpoints, seriously","Guven is a great lecturer and really cares about his students' learning.  Shantia is probably the best TF you can find.  So the teaching staff couldn't be any better for someone interesting in philosophy of mind\/psychology but who hasn't taken any philosophy before.  Not too much work, but you can definitely get a lot of knowledge out of this course regardless!  I always looked forward to coming to class, and highly recommend it even as just a fascinating elective!","You'll learn interesting topics in this class, all the while not having too much reading (at all)! Perfect duo.","Biggest gem at Harvard. Take this class.","This class was really boring. I feel that if the class had been offered in tutorial form like it has in the past, it may have been better. But the class was too big to really ask any questions, and the topics on the whole was not what I was expecting.  With that said, it was pretty easy.","This is a great course to those with broad interests in psychology and philosophy. Guven is an absolutely phenomenal lecturer, extremely fair, and the work load is completely manageable. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for an easy, interesting class that allows them to explore their own ideas.","Great class on interesting topics. Guven is an amazing professor who is caring and willing to provide feedback and help if you're actively seeking it.","Very cool class that will open your mind to the mind and teach you to think like a philosopher.","Such a wonderful class. Professors are so nice and approachable. Guven and shantia really care about their students. I have no background in philosophy but I loved this","Guven is awesome and so is Shantia!","Guven is a homie. A lengend. A god. The course material is super interesting, the course work load is very manageable, and Guven is a homie.","A really great class! I took it because I was interested in both philosophy and psychology but hadn't studied much of both, and I've walked away like I've learned loads about each. The topics are interesting enough that studying about them\/writing about them doesn't really feel like very much work, even though you will be learning philosophical methods of argumentation that I'm sure are very helpful to know. I would only reccommend not taking this course if you're the kind of person who truly can't stand open-ended questions and uncertainty, because this class is more about devising different ways to think about certain questions and deciding which questions are important than it is about answering them (although you do get to try to do that in your final paper).","Enjoy your time. This class is interesting, and doesn't require a large amount of work.","The professor and teaching fellow really care about every student's understanding of the material and success in the class and outside of it.  They are very approachable.  In addition, this is a very good class if you want an introduction to philosophy.","good 4th class"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.40","difficulty":"2.00","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"33","response rate":"60.61","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHIL 22","course_id":"10599","cat_num":"54404","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHIL 22","course_id":"10599","cat_num":"54404","1s":"4","2s":"13","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHIL 22","course_id":"10599","cat_num":"54404","1s":"13","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
