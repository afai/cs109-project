'07":{"comments":["Be prepared to do a lot of readings, but they are highly enjoyable!","Transnational Modernism might sound confusing, but do not let the title dissuade you: the course is interesting and fun and Jennie is amazing!","You absolutely must do the reading. Prioritize this course over all others because it will be your most difficult, but you also won't regret it at all. This is from someone who doesn't like doing work but who looked forward to this class every week and enjoyed the reading immensely.","The small class size (but not one-on-one) allows for excellent and exciting conversations with your peers and your instructor. It's an enjoyable and sophisticated next-level for English concentrators.","Despite the heavier work load, this is an excellent tutorial and Greta is wonderful.  Definitely recommend to English concentrators who like Victorian literature.  One of my favorite English classes I've taken at Harvard so far.","I doubt the same tutorial will be offered again, but if it were to be offered, I'd tell people to take it because it's an approach to literature that not many English classes take: it based around an issue in poetry, not a time period or a specific poet.","It is the perfect class for someone who doesn't know anything about avant-garde lit or who thinks they won't like it.","As with any junior tutorial, your enjoyment of the course will depend on your interest in the reading materials.  I really enjoyed reading Victorian literature, but many students would not find it as interesting as other genres."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["This was, I'm sad to say, probably the most disappointing academic experience I've had in the English department--which I have otherwise loved.  In my sophomore seminar, the professor took a profound interest in each student, worked with us on writing, got to know our interests, etc.  Josh is clearly a very smart and very talented guy who could bring a lot to the table, but I got the impression that he just didn't care very much about this tutorial.  He spent, as far as I can tell, very little time on this outside class.  He often picked the book we would read at the end of class, which meant we had to scramble off to the bookstore, library, etc. to see if we could beat the other students to the few Harvard Square copies.  Sometimes I couldn't find the book when all the copies were out at the library.  We wrote nothing except the final essay and thus received no feedback of any sort at any point during the semester.  I just don't see how learning can take place if we're at no point told what we're doing well and what could be done better.  It's also my understanding that a tutorial should be a venue where the TF gets to know the students well, which I again feel like never happened.  I know how busy things must be for a grad student juggling responsibilities, but I was really disappointed to find a number of e-mails going unanswered.","This was a dream course.  I looked forward to class every week.  Other English majors would be lucky to end up in a tutorial that was this much fun and this illuminating about a subject.","Avant-garde theater: it's really as absurd as you've heard.","Read all of these books whether you take the class or not. But take the class. And then we should get coffee every week to talk about it together.","Galena is one of the best teachers that I've had at Harvard.","You should really try to get a one-on-one tutorial.  Nothing will make you as intellectually enthusiastic.","Make sure you pick a good junior paper topic because you're going to be spending a long time with it!","Take any class that Hannah Sullivan teaches","I would highly recommend a 98 tutorial to all interested concentrators.","If you like Victorian Literature, this is the class for you!"]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Don't take RJ for granted. He's fantastic, and the course materials and significant AND fun.","Even if you're not interested in Renaissance drama, it is worth taking because Suparna is a truly excellent teacher.","I would tell people that this course is a great way for them to learn a lot about Renaissance theater and to approach it in a way that gives especially valuable insights as to its origins and development.","This course was like getting credit to go to a Jane Austen book club. Jacob was a great discussion facilitator and we read amazing books.","Need to be interested in the topic.  I'd say the English Department could have done a better job taking into consideration my requests I submitted last spring.","Again, I can't stop raving about R.J.  His enthusiasm, his intelligence, and his sincere care and concern for each student truly made my tutorial experience better than I could have imagined.","This is a great way to fulfill the English 98 requirement.","The best class I have taken at Harvard. Period.","Your writing will improve dramatically.","smart and fun","Only take this tutorial if you are fully prepared to spend an entire semester on one poem -- it is rewarding, but also taxing."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["TAKE IT! Best English course I've taken thus far! Marcella is so approachable, yet incredibly intelligent. A perfect tutorial leader.","RJ is an amazing tutor, and anyone would be lucky to have him.","I would not recommend enrolling in this course unless you have a strong interest in medieval and Renaissance poetry.","Take it, because Sabrina is amazing!","Some of the texts were difficult, but I generally found them very interesting and diverse. The tutorial gives you a chance to explore your own interests in depth while discussing various other texts and critical approaches as well.","The reading is great, and while the material looked somewhat dry at times it ended up being fascinating and an enjoyable experience overall.","100% take this course. RJ is a phenomenal teacher, and the discussions were fascinating.","I absolutely loved this class. It's the best class I've taken at Harvard, and it's the reason why I'm writing a thesis now. I learned more in this class than  I have in any other, and I feel like I have a better understanding of how to write, to come up with provocative arguments about literature, and to read closely.","Do the readings -- not because you'll be embarrassed and targeted for being unprepared, but because the classes and discussions are really stimulating when you're up-to-date, but not worth very much if you can't follow along.","Tutorial is a valuable experience and Byron was enjoyable!","This course was one of the best classes, if not the best class, I have taken at Harvard. The syllabus was incredible, R.J. was a superb instructor, and the class discussion was some of the best I've experienced.  If I could take this class again, I would!"]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["I learned a great deal about poets and literary criticism.

Or, do you just love high-quality discussions with an engaging and actually \/nice\/ leader?  If so, you should take this course!  It is, as one might say in popular parlance, \"made of win.\"","Lesley is a great teacher, and the reading are movies are great","Maia is very approachable and always ready to help.","Take this course if you are serious about your concentration and willing to dedicate a semester to writing one thoughtful paper.","Think and start final paper early.","The junior tutorial is the crowning course of the English concentration. It brings together all the strands of the courses you have taken before and deepens your understanding of how to research. Take this course.","I think the Junior Tutorial is a great opportunity.  Studying with a grad student is in many ways better than studying with a professor, I think - you get a good sense for what it's like to really be doing research and your own work, and you don't have to put up with a crotchety professor.","This course was one of my favorite courses at Harvard. I loved all of the required reading and looked forward to discussing them in class.","It was a really interesting topic for a tutorial. Far more relevant and modern than most of the other topics and because of the recent rise of the internet\/ new media. Definitely a topic for provocative discussion.","Very interesting, lots of reading. Highly recommend to English concentrators with interest in film\/radio\/television\/other media and cultural studies.","Awesome! Read the Invisible Man earlier than its assigned week!","Before taking Renaissance B-Sides you might ask, why read these if they are not well read in first place? Well, my friends, would you forgo listening the rest of Beatles after listening to only \"Yesterday\" or \"Hey Jude\" and other renowned pieces of the magical band? I would say that the B-sides is necessary for any concentrators, and it is not just that reading the obscure ones makes you appreciate the popular ones better--it allows you to find the gem in the whole constellation of works out there--and lets you find your own taste better than any canon could.","This class was an in-depth study of the, arguably, most famous and important poets of the 20th century. I learned more from this class than I have in several years of taking large English classes (such as English 10a and 10b)."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The junior tutorial is one of the best English classes you will take as a concentrator.  It is great to have such intimate discussions and really get to know your classmates, their interests, and talk about the material in great depth but in a low-stress environment.  Although it can be arduous at times, at the end of the semester, you will feel proud of the work you did on your junior paper as a major milestone in your academic career.  This class was particularly interesting and relevant for our time, in my opinion, for the various ways that literature intervenes in poverty and social issues are manifesting in different ways today.","I would mostly highlight the strengths of Sarah, who was able to construct a well-made syllabus, provide some of the most helpful feedback that I have received at Harvard, and lead interesting discussions.","The instructor is intelligent and the materials are interesting, but secondary materials varied considerably in their usefulness.","This was actually the best class I've ever taken at Harvard. I enjoyed it so thoroughly.","There was very little concrete structure, which would have been fine if the TF didn't get pissy when you were confused by the vagueness of the assignments. And she would then try to solicit commentary on the syllabus, but when you were honest, she got pissy again. Lose-lose situation.","This course is wonderfully far-reaching in scope. The readings are dense, and the format of discussion is quite loose. This could be frustrating for someone who wants more structure, but I found it an ideal forum for voicing confusion with the readings or asking questions about the final paper.","The research portion is a bit daunting, but that is to be expected in any tutorial, and Odile's guidance was amazing.","You will never learn more and have more satisfying discussions in a more relaxed and enjoyable environment.","Obviously, if you don't enjoy poetry, this course would be the wrong fit, but if you do like it, this course is great preparation for a thesis.","This class is truly phenomenal. Its very strong syllabus is complemented by a very strong instructor. Not only is the subject matter fascinating, but it requires a degree of literary analysis that is unprecedented in most english classes.","I came away from this course with a different concept of manners--both of its pervasiveness and its motivations.  Especially in a place like Harvard, manners are everywhere, and the utilization of manners are much more directly related to power dynamics in a society than one would think.","Put some thought and organization into the paper as early as possible.","it will be a ton of work.","Good for learning a lot about a specific topic and improving your writing skills.  A little frustrating for Honors Concentrators who are not pursuing the critical thesis track.","Definitely take this course if you are familiar with Shakespeare. If you are not comfortable with the Shakespearean cannon, don't take it.","The English department's tutorials are its most wonderful classes. I loved both my sophomore tutorial and my junior tutorial: connected with the reading, got to know the instructors, enjoyed the assignments.","Sabrina's amazing, too bad that she's not teaching anymore.","Steven is awesome."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["If your tutorial deals with something you're genuinely interested in, it will be a fantastic class.","Fantastic readings for Fun With Will & Jane! Also, Rikita is a very knowledgeable and understanding tutor. The idea of synthesizing Austen and Shakespeare is both challenging and rewarding.","Makes you a better writer, and the workload is really not that much more than a seminar. Take it if you can, even if you don't think you want to write a thesis (it might change your mind!).","This is a truly wonderful junior tutorial. R.J. is an exceptionally talented and supportive teacher who always knew how to lead our group in discussion and consistently offered incisive commentary. I loved the texts that we read and while the junior tutorial paper was challenging, it was amazingly rewarding.","The course focuses a lot more on literary subculture than ones more commonly thought of, such as the punk movement and more current ones.","I don't guess this matters much, but I would take this. Every term.","Best requirement you'll ever take.","Literary research can actually be extremely interesting and rewarding.","Wonderful reading experience. Do take it.","This class is really fun and laid back, and the readings are so unusual you are unlikely to read them in any other class at Harvard.","This class is very interesting and you do learn a lot, but it can be complex and complicated at times. The feedback you receive is helpful, and your writing will improve, but it is a lot of work.","The junior tutorial was one of the best academic experiences I have had at Harvard. Being in a section with 10 people is nice, but its nothing compared to talking with just a few other people. It really helps you to develop your ideas beyond just superficial comments. Writing the junior paper is challenging, but also a great experience and helps you get an idea of what writing a thesis might be like. Its really nice to be able to forge an academic bond with your peers and tutorial leader."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This tutorial was a wonderful way to explore my own literary interests while still having the close support and guidance of my tutorial leader and classmates. Overall, a great experience!","A great opportunity to write a longer, larger (conceptually) paper than you'd usually write in english classes","a challenging but wonderful course. the students really do guide the discussion, so be prepared for every class.","That it's a uniquely intimate experience, especially for an English class at Harvard, and that if you have a good subject (and a good tutorial leader, like Nikki!), it'll be a blast.","Best tutorial ever!!! I learned so much from every aspect of the class, especially the critical readings and our discussion of those readings in relation to the novels we studied. The way I evaluate a book has changed so much this semester, and I feel much more prepared as an English concentrator.","This class will definitely hone your writing skills so that you can write insightful, structured, and most, importantly, fulfilling papers. Richard Johnston is the best - try to take his tutorial if it's available!!!","It is amazing and Maggie is fantastic!","When you ask yourself, \"Should I take this course?\" your immediate response should be nothing other than, \"yes I said yes I will Yes.\"","From talking to other juniors in their tutorials, I'd definitely say this is probably the best section!","the junior tutorial is a fabulous class and certainly one of my favorites at harvard.","This junior tutorial was a great way to read Joyce's major works in a supported group effort but without feeling bogged down by too much academic footnoting.  It has been one of my most fulfilling classes at Harvard.","Probably the best academic experience I have had in the English department","One of the best classes I've ever taken, with one of the best tutors.","Rich is wonderful and the texts are really interesting and engaging. Take it if you can!","A great survey course of the American short story.  Because we read only short stories, the reading was never overwhelming, although some weeks we had a lot of criticism as well.  But because the American short story is, in a sense, so contemporary, this is a wonderful course for testing out new ideas and forming new theories, and for getting great feedback from the students and TF.","If you are an English concentrator debating whether or not to do honors, DO IT. The tutorial is a serious academic challenge, but it allowed me to engage with a subject that I loved and to produce the best paper I have written at Harvard. If you are taking a tutorial that deals with novels, read a few of them over the summer or winter break before your class - the criticism will likely be dense and demand a lot of your time, so it will be helpful to be able to skim back over the novel rather than having to read every word. Taking this class was such a rewarding experience, and I highly highly recommend it.","Enjoy engaging with the texts.  Read them out loud.  Look at them as works of visual art.  \"Reading the Animal\" is the perfect class for making aesthetic associations and running with them.","Take the preliminary work for your junior paper seriously. It helps a lot come time to produce your final paper.","This was the best academic experience that I have had at Harvard. No class has caused me to grow as a thinker about literature as much as this one has. It is rigorous and challenging, but not prohibitively so. It is quite intense, but you will appreciate every minute of it. You have to be willing to really throw yourself into the material and the theory. However, even if you have no background in theory--as I did not--you will be able to keep up as long as you do the readings, and you will learn and grow a lot in the process.","This is a great tutorial because you'll get the paper prep, but more importantly you'll be asked to think on your feet, make claims, and defend them. That can be scary to do at times, but it's an incredibly valuable skill to develop and will help you to become a better writer. Plus, you get to read, write, and think about food. Win!","Matt is great!","It's a lot of reading, but you will learn more (about critical theory, romanticism, the beginnings of the novel, and much, much more) than in any other class in the department.","Richard is so chill and encouraging!","Take this course! Absolutely take this course."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["It's a lot of work, but definitely one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard.","If you have a good TF, the tutorial can be an amazing experience.  Go for a course with a reading list you like.","Junior tutorial is great! You should definitely go into it thinking that it will be a priority for you during the semester so that you can really engage in the discussions and get everything out of it that you should. Writing the junior paper is challenging but rewarding -- regardless of when it is due in your tutorial, I recommend starting to think about it very early on so that it doesn't overwhelm you come late November.","It's an incredible course that challenges you to think about American fiction that is being published right now in an entirely new way. If you're interested in coming to terms with the contemporary using critical thinking, this class is for you.","It is definitely a commitment and a challenge, but well worth it.","You really learn how to write!","Kaye is one of the best teachers I've ever had and you will learn a great deal.","This was absolutely one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard - in fact, classes like this are what I looked forward to the most about college. We had amazing discussions and I feel like I learned a lot not only from the material and the teacher, but my classmates as well.","Great course. Kathryn is the ideal tutorial instructor, deeply knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and committed to her students. Readings are engaging (some weeks very heavy) and their interrelations are fun to excavate. I had none but the most superficial familiarity with the novelists of the period, and was pleasantly surprised to find myself really enjoying their company.","If you're on the fence deciding whether or not to write a thesis, take the junior tutorial just in case. Even if you decide against the thesis, you'll have taken an awesome course with a tutorial leader who is really passionate about what he\/she is teaching. Your tutorial leader will be there to answer ALL of your questions; they're very dedicated to their students. My junior tutorial was one of the best classroom experiences I've had at Harvard.","Even if you don't enjoy environmental literature and this wouldn't be your first pick for a junior tutorial, you'd still enjoy this class. Assuming you're an English major who enjoys reading and writing, Thoreau, Wordsworth, Defoe (Robinson Cruesoe), Dillard, etc. are authors who will challenge you and require you to simultaneously think critically and creatively. \r\n\r\nAlso, Jake is the man so that's an added plus.","This class is an excellent and valuable experience in doing a longer, literature based research paper. If you are thinking at all about writing a thesis, it could give you a better idea whether or not you actually want to write one based on a smaller experience. Stephen Tardif was an excellent TF, so try to get into his section if you can!","Phenomenal.","An extremely fulfilling experience for any English concentrator. However, do not underestimate the amount of work necessary to achieve that level of fulfillment.","Although it is a requirement, it is rewarding to have accomplished so much by the end of the semester."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class was incredibly rewarding but was one of the more difficult English literature classes I've taken.","The junior tutorial is an awesome opportunity, but it can also be really intense.  Make sure to pick yours carefully.  You have to love your topic, or be open to loving a topic you maybe don't know very much about.  Know what you're getting yourself into regarding the reading list, and go with a tutor you have either enjoyed working with before, or have heard great things about.","TAKE THIS CLASS! You will love the novels, and Kristen is such a great teacher!","it's a somewhat difficult topic but the discussions are interesting and relaxed","Challenging but rewarding readings working with a very smart and generous TF.","Very rewarding class, the junior paper process especially is worthwhile and really helped me decide to committ to doing a thesis. Tiny group discussion is also unlike anything I've ever taken.","wonderful tutorial!  i learned a lot about american short story in this class.  martin is a very devoted and committed teacher.","This was one of the best courses I've taken at this school. A great introduction to a number of theoretical schools that offer profound ideas on literature and life, and a great assortment of books that you wouldn't find on any other syllabus in the English department. This will change the way you read novels, and possibly the way you view humanity.","Find out what Margaret is TFing or teaching, and take that.","I learned a lot about writing real papers and incorporating academia into my thoughts.","Laura is a very kind and thoughtful tutorial leader.  You can tell that she cares about her students and wants them to produce the best work they can.","If you're going for Honors, you'll be taking this class. Luckily, it's worth it and will be one of your best academic experiences at Harvard."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Having this kind of individual attention is an important educational experience and privilege. Your writing will improve, as well as your ability to critically read and research. This is a fantastic way to learn by discussion.","It seems to me unlikely that this exact tutorial will happen again -- is that how it works? I didn't believe so -- but in the event that it does, future students, this is a fantastic, fantastic choice of tutorial. It's a great exploration of the most prominent literary movements of the late 20th and early 21st century, but it's also strong in how well it connects those literary movements to 20th and 21st century history.","TAKE THIS COURSE! The tutorial is designed to foster personal relationships and intellectual growth in a small, intimate setting of only 3-4 individuals. You get to produce some serious work and receive some great feedback in return.\r\nMoreover, if you can, take the tutorial with Daniel Williams! I first met Daniel when he was my section leader for Professor Fisher's modernism course, and I can truly say that he is one of the most intelligent and considerate TFs you'll encounter. You can learn more from talking with him about ethics, post-colonial theory, anthropology, French\/German philosophy, ethnography, and art than you can from listening to some lecturer in a large classroom. He is passionate about the subject matter (South African literature, which is bizarre and beautiful, is such a rarity in the English department) and genuinely cares about his students. Also, his own experiences at Harvard as an undergraduate, his time at Cambridge, and his familiarity with the PhD program are incredible resources.","This introduces an important body of readings which are rarely taught, and treats them with care and thoughtfulness. I don't think I've ever previously had an opportunity at Harvard to read such powerful works, or to think about them with such depth.","This has been my favorite course as Harvard thus far - as an English major it was the best experience. I didn't have any particular interest in religious novels, but the format and flexibility of the class enabled me to enjoy what I was learning, and get a lot out of the subject.","Everything about the tutorial is absolutely fantastic and I wish I could take  more than one tutorial in the department. It has been one of my best experiences at Harvard and I hope the department never gets rid of them. It has taught me more about both the material and also about how to write good papers and how to do good research than almost any other course I've taken so far.","Writing a junior paper is a terrible, terrible experience. If you are a typical English concentrator, you probably won't be prepared to present a well structured, well researched, entirely original argument. It's harder than it sounds. That being said, my particular tutorial was otherwise excellent. It was my favorite class at Harvard so far, other than the paper.","Be diligent about your readings. Make sure you pick a class with readings you're really excited about doing.","If you like reading long, interesting novels and then talking about them, this class is for you! Very rewarding and also opened my eyes up to the entire world of literary theory, plus Alison is super-smart and helpful and guides discussion well.","John is an incredible tutor head, with a wealth of knowledge.","Difficulty and confusion might seem like topics that a student would want to eschew, but this course was a satisfying exercise in embracing the appeal of thorniness. Although the syllabus only covered modern and post-modern works, the most salient issues addressed in the tutorial are in no way limited to the 20th or 21st century. As a result, the application of what was discussed to other works and eras provided valuable, at times quite unexpected, insight into the appeal and utility of the abstruse.","This is a fabulous class, definitely take it if you want to improve your writing.","Made me look at literature in a whole new way, and allowed me to explore my interest in the analysis of film and television as literature. Great experience.","This class pushes your paper writing skills to a whole other level-- you will be able to produce a 25 page paper which you will be proud of. You'll be ready to write a thesis!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is one of the best, if not the best course I have taken at Harvard.  I left tutorial every week excited about the reading material, excited about my junior paper, and excited about learning in general, which is quite the feat for any course.","STEPHEN IS AMAZING. THIS COURSE IS AMAZING. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS AMAZING.","Writing a junior thesis is difficult, but it is so much easier if you are studying a compelling topic such as Dickens and The Wire and if your TF is as wonderfully supportive and insightful as Liz.","Liz is great. I hope tutorials like this continue to be taught!","There's a lot of unstructured, independent study type stuff involved. Prepare accordingly. Other than that, it's great, the syllabus is fab, and Stephen is the man.","Kathryn is an excellent instructor. The readings are exceptional (and, even for lovers of Southern lit, many of them are new), and the discussion are genuinely enlightening.","This class is so interesting because it combines classic literature with new adaptions so you get a little bit of everything. You can read the Waste land in any class but can you read the Waste Land paired with Arthurian romances in a lot of other classes?? Probably not.","This course is not easy nor is it hard.  I found myself wanting to come to class on multiple occasions just for the discussion.  The small class size was perfect for facilitating good talking points and Liz was extremely knowledgeable throughout the duration of the seminar.  If a student were to have a hands on teacher in a course like this, he or she would be very lucky to have Liz.  The cinematic and literary components were well balanced and allowed me to form a topic without too much pressure from either medium.","This is a fascinating and fun course. Kathryn is extremely insightful and sweet and a delight to work with. The materials are entertaining and vary widely in style and subject matter. The course really gives you a sense of the impressive range and, strangely, the remarkable similarities of Southern literature.","This is the perfect course for die-hard Janeites and newcomers to Jane Austen's work alike. The readings are fabulous, and Lesley is wonderful.","Austen provides an amazing body of work on which to write a junior paper. I especially enjoyed working with adaptations and learning about that field of scholarship.","It really helps you grow as a thinker, pushing you to participate and commit fully to discussions.","This was definitely an enjoyable and educational way to fill my junior tutorial. We read great books and I felt like I learned a lot about how to write about and discuss contemporary fiction. Nick gives really helpful feedback on what you write, which I really appreciated.","I think my junior tutorial experience has been one of the best I've had in my time at the English department. The work is challenging, and it was my first time doing such a large paper, but the attention that you get and the assistance and feedback throughout the process is really beneficial for enabling you to improve yourself as a writer and literary critic, and also to increase your confidence in yourself as these things. If you're considering doing a thesis but uncertain if you have what it takes, I'd really recommend this as an opportunity to gain the relevant research and writing skills that you will need. On a more specific level, I really enjoyed this particular tutorial (the African American Tradition of Autobiography) for the way it allowed for us to appreciate the literary value of the texts while delving into the racial and social justice politics surrounding their creation. David is really a phenomenal teacher and if you have the chance to take this class I'd recommend it highly.","Take this course if you want to learn about things that you will not learn in any other class at Harvard. This course is unique in its content. Liz is a fantastic teacher and she is dedicated to her students. If you put the time into understanding the reading in this course you will come away, at the end of the semester, with knowledge of storytelling that will serve you well.","The English junior tutorial is a great way to delve into a topic with a small group, and the study of medieval themes yields such a fun range of texts-- from The Faerie Queene to Grimm's fairy tales to The Lord of the Rings."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Kathryn is an amazing tutorial tutor. Not only do you get to know two fantastic authors, but you get to know your classmates and tutor in the process. An incredible course and experience!","Reading these poems with Calista each week was a true pleasure. Not only were the poems lovingly chosen, they also served as generous introductions to each poet (and what amazing poets, too--Bishop, Lowell, Merrill, O'Hara, Berryman, Ammons, etc.). We visited Houghton to read Ashbery's college correspondences, O'Hara's early publications, and Bishop's annotated books. Conversation was always lively, even after a long day of classes, and written work always received ample marginalia, helpful as ever with notes on structure, argument, and style. I'll carry these poems with me for a long time; I can already tell that Bishop and O'Hara will provide lifelong company, and for that I'm truly pleased.","This was a great junior tutorial. The material was interesting and stimulating, and Nick is a great preceptor.","This is a great class if you are interested in ideology! Be prepared to do a significant amount of reading, though.","This course really strengthened my abilities to write and think about structuring a long paper, and prepared me to think about writing a thesis. It gave me the chance to write something that I feel really proud of.","This is a great class! You'll have to write a 25 page paper at the end, as with all english jr tutorials. But the works and material are super interesting!!","Kathryn is an excellent instructor, and I would urge all looking at tutorials to look at Kathryn's course.","This Tutorial has been a highlight of my academic career! Calista is a phenomenal teacher who consistently went above and beyond to support my learning, and the material is rich and lends itself well to meaningful close reading. Writing the Junior Paper seems daunting because it's so different from all the other papers assigned in English classes, but the encouragement and constructive feedback of this class made it into the very best kind of challenge, one that was a pleasure to undertake. I could not more highly recommend this class!","I learned an immense amount from this tutorial and I'm grateful that I was able to be exposed to such a wide array of great works. I feel like the course definitely prepared me for the experience of writing an English thesis.","Maggie is fantastic in this course. Her feedback and enthusiasm for the material makes the semester's worth of reading quite exciting. Doing all the readings is both enjoyable and adds to the discussion (especially important when the class is only total 4 students!)","Kristen's tutorial completely changed my perspective on English literature from around the world and how it is received. I also learned how to think critically about each text and how to conduct my own research. I had never written a 25 page paper before, but Kristen was there to help every step of the way."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This was a fantastic class - Joey is a great tutorial leader, and the subject matter is awesome!","Excellent class. I highly recommend it.","Highlight of my career as an English concentrator!","This class did a great job of proving that young adult literature is not bad literature.  Joey was an amazing section leader.  And the syllabus just can't be beat... \r\nJunior tutorials, in general, are not easy because of the paper component... but if you have a supportive section leader, you're all set.","Do the reading; this is a really rewarding experience.","Reading the works of these two fantastic women writers was an amazing experience, especially with Margaret. The reading is so enjoyable and the paper writing is worth the effort. You will work hard and be very proud!","Maggie is a wonderful teacher who really values her students and their abilities, and she really helps to get students to improve the quality of their work. A leader by example in literary criticism, she is one of the best Teachers I have interacted with.","This tutorial was excellently taught. It was a refreshing balance between reading and discussion on one hand, and work on our individual projects on the other. I felt well-equipped to produce my junior paper, and really enjoyed the process. Martin Greenup is particularly wonderful, and I feel lucky to have gotten his class.","American poetry is fascinating, and this is the best way to study it.","Honestly don't miss this one. I'm a Shakespeare fanatic and I adored it.","The best junior tutorial, hands down.","Every one of your friends will be insanely jealous that you get to take this class. Then you will write an awesome junior paper.","This is an enjoyable and rewarding course, though it may not be exactly what you are expecting. You will spend a great deal of time close reading the primary texts and analyzing complex works of comedic theory. While this may surprise the aspiring comedy professional who thought this would be a semester-long joke-writing class (guilty), this may come as a surprise, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. I personally learned a great deal about both the history of comedy and the nature of laughter in a concentrated amount of time, and I believe it has affected my writing for the better. Those of you looking for practical advice will want to pay particular attention to Bergson, as well as Freud, Frye, and other academics studied early in the semester. 'Infinite Jest' is for everyone, whether you prefer to write humor or analyze it in an academic setting.","A few strengths of this class: fascinating materials, a compelling core project, stimulating discussion, and general excellence in its teaching.  Seth provided top-notch feedback on our papers, facilitated discussion better than most full professors I've had, and brought insight and understanding to every aspect of the course.  For those of us with a slight background in music theory, he was patient and lucid in his explanations.  And for those with more experience with the technical sides of music, he was able to bring our analytical abilities to a higher level.  The class was fun, deep-yet-accessible, and intellectually stimulating in the extreme."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class was one of my favorites that I have taken at Harvard.","If you can take any class during your undergraduate career, make it a class with John Radway.","This is the ideal English class. The small class size (my class at 5 students was considered large) and dedicated guidance of the tutor allow you to engage with the materials and topic at a deeper level than I have found in any other class taken at Harvard. The seminar is 50% reading and discussion and 50% writing and research. Whatever interests you come into the seminar with, make them known in the first meeting so that the tutor can help guide your independent reading and research in a direction you'll love. That being said, challenge yourself by taking a seminar that isn't perfectly aligned with your comfort-zone. I discovered the joys of Dramatic Modernism this semester, and am now seriously reconsidering my senior thesis research. Above all, this course has given me an appreciation for a genre I never thought I'd enjoy, but now am seeking out in my spare time. You should find a seminar that you want to put before all other classwork. This reading and research should come first, and the more time you spend with this class early in the semester, the more you will get out of it by the end. You need to develop a good working relationship with your tutor from the start, so go to office hours, ask to meet outside of class, and email, email, email. Also, know that the syllabus isn't set in stone and will mold to your interests and needs as an academic, just so long as you make you voice your concerns.","The course material was so interesting and Rebecca is a great teacher!","It really was difficult in the sense that there was a lot of work, but intensely rewarding and educational.  You should attempt to make room in your schedule to focus on this class by taking a lighter courseload.","John is an incredible tutor, and the material is fantastic! Take this class.","If you want to learn, truly learn, take this class. While the workload may seem overly demanding at first, after 3 or 4 weeks you find the natural rhythm of the class. This class is unlike anything I've ever taken from the department--both in what it demanded of me and what I got out of it. I can't recommend it enough. I think also, compared to some of the other tutorials, this tutorial provides far more scope than just critical analysis and close reading. Take this tutorial and you will grow immensely as a student, thankful for Matthew Ocheltree and the discussions he engendered.","The junior tutorial is one of the hardest classes i've taken at harvard. it is also the most rewarding. it changed how i think about not just theory but about literature in general. The small class size made it fun and accessible, and the weekly meetings during the writing process helped me produce a paper i am really proud of. If you love critical writing, i would highly recommend this course.","This class is not easy. It's pretty intensive- a lot of reading, and writing the drafts is not fun, as much as you might love your topic. Having said that, this is meant to be an intensive class to give you a taste of what thesis-ing senior year might be like, so while it was painful at times, it was necessary. Besides these structural things, the actual content of the classes was extremely enjoyable (for the most part...ugh, Pound), and Matt was a phenomenal instructor that made learning about a heavy topic really fascinating and memorable. Overall, the english junior tutorial class itself is rough, but necessarily so. World War I lit + any class with Matt is amazing.","Michael is a talented teacher, and extremely smart. The material is a great introduction to 20th century American poetry.","Michael is a great tutor. He facilitates discussion well, is always enthusiastic, and always has a lot to say about the readings. You'll learn a lot about contemporary poetry and the issues involved.","Reading one new American short story author each week is amazing! Having that kind of focus really nails down the essentials to what short fiction is. And it also gave me the enthusiasm to start tracing my own interests in short fiction."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"6.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"17","response rate":"94.12","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENGLISH 98r","course_id":"1520","cat_num":"3831","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"13"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENGLISH 98r","course_id":"1520","cat_num":"3831","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"16","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENGLISH 98r","course_id":"1520","cat_num":"3831","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
