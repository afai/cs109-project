However, ultimately you will produce higher quality work than you thought yourself capable of, and you will learn more about the subject and field than most other people actually in the field. Parker may seem like a scary guy, but his class is trial by fire - if you don't drop out of the class, and work your ass off, he will respect and reward you heavily.","The work must be done fast and to a very exact set of specifications (and lot of work to boot).  Get through it, don't take anything personally, and there's quite a bit of insight to be had from the course.  Due to teaching style, I can't say it's the course for everyone though."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.70","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
