Many students often feel guilty embarking on side projects that will distract from their academics. Having this class allowed me to work on something I love and feel even more justified to do so. I strongly recommend this class if you have and idea and the determination to make it succeed. This class can only give you what you put in. I learned that through out the semester and once I began to really devote my time, I began to see that I got what I had been working for.","You have to be self-driven and actually motivated and interested in the startup world to be able to take full advantage of this course. It's very easy to get lost and lose motivation if you take this course without a specific goal in mind.","The only reason I marked this class as \"with reservations\" was because it's not really a class for the average student.  It's a resource for serious entrepreneurs who need extra time to work on their project.  If you don't have something you will look like a fool.  Other than that, if you fit the bill this is a god send.","Great class if you want to work on an existing start-up or want to start brand new.","If you want to make something and really put your heart into it, this class is the perfect venue.","You get as much as you put in. I loved my experience and the freedom to work on my startup half-time.","Don't use this course to just sort of work on an idea. Really fully commit to your idea. I dedicated 20 hours a week to my startup!","This class and Professor Bottino are great. It is not a typical class at all. All you do is work on your own start-up. Professor Bottino helps you understand what makes companies successful\/failures and what the real world looks for in a company. He also brings in great outside people to meet to help you learn even more","Be prepared to put a lot of time into your start-up.","This course is great if you have a clear idea for a start-up and have either already begun developing it or plan to do so. Paul Bottino is an outstanding mentor and offers great guidance.","Good for the self-directed and the motivated. Professor Bottino is very knowledgeable and can really put you on the right path.","If you have a startup, take it for sure. Not only does the class allow you more time to put into your project, but Paul's feedback helps a lot in getting you on the right track. Plus, the guests that Paul brought in were great and helped you establish connections in the industry."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The individual meetings are great. It sounds like the group interactions are improving for the years to come, so I strongly recommend using this as a chance to make your ideas reality!","If you have a fleshed out business plan this course is a MUST!!! But, do not take the course just to take it...","Do not take this course if you would just like a couple of hours a week to work on a \"startup.\" Take this if you will dedicate your free time really to solving a problem.","If you want to structure you startup then take this course! Also if you want to experience a part of the entrepreneurial side of the college then all the enthusiasm and support from this course will enable you to see this part of the college.","ES95r is truly amazing.  Professor Bottino is an unbelievable teacher, and he continuously goes above and beyond to make this course a great experience in the students' Harvard education.","Literally the best course I've taken at Harvard. Amazing start-ups, amazing people, and an amazing instructor. If you have an idea and a team, use this class to allot time every week to advancing your startup. It's not easy: you end up putting in a lot of time and effort and you ultimately get out of it what you put in. With that in mind, this is not for everyone. I would recommend waiting until junior or senior year to take it, even if you have the skills. It requires a lot of maturity, which only comes with age and wisdom. So glad Harvard has opportunities like this and wish we had more!","Prof. Bottino is extremely supportive, enthusiastic and helpful.","Probably the best class I've taken","One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Paul Bottino is a phenomenal person to know and is incredibly helpful. Overall, ES95r is what you make of it. If you are driven and excited about a project\/venture, this course can be extremely useful if you put the time into it.","This is an excellent class which will teach you to be a better founder and teach you especially valuable metrics for evaluating yourself as a founder as well as evaluating your startup's progress over time. Working on your startup doesn't (and shouldn't, hopefully) feel like work anyway, so this class is essentially work-free, which is a bonus!","Amazing opportunity to pursue a very non-traditional education. This is very much a self-learning opportunity to work on and build your own start-up company. Prior to the course starting, having a solid start-up idea and more importantly TEAM is absolutely crucial.","Great class if you are truly serious about dedicating your free time to starting a company! Best to come in with a well-developed idea and semester game plan to make the most of this course","Paul Bottino will give you a lot of great advice but it is up to YOU to implement the advice.","Great class.  Provides a lot of previously unavailable tools to student entrepreneurs.  The teaching\/advising is the best component of the course.","You need to be very self motivated.  This course is about using your time well.  Paul expects you to really want to succeed and if you are just looking for an easy A this is not the class for you. Paul is great.  If you've got a good idea then this is the place to develop it.  Also, apply to i3 challenge! It's free money.","If you are a student entrepreneur and want to work for startups\/start startups, this class is for you. You will not regret it. I wish the university would provide more support for this class.","This class is a great opportunity to explore future business opportunities. Prof. Bottino is an invaluable resource.","Great way to build on your start-up and expand your network.  The more you put in, the more you get out.","If you would like the chance to work on a startup as a part of your academic schedule, take this. It was great to be able to know I could commit more time to my startup because it didnt mean i had to take time away from another class. The environment was great, Paul is great. I wish that the school could put more power behind entrepreneurship as a legitimate student path of study - as you learn so much about life in the process of working on a company.","Paul is a rockstar. If you don't know him yet, take this course and make it your business to get to know him. His expertise and experience across a wide variety of disciplines make him an all-star advisor for any young and ambitious start-up team looking for unparalleled advice. You can tell he really cares about the success of every start-up team, and more importantly, makes an effort to do everything in his power to see that potential manifest itself in tangible success stories. In our case that meant laying the groundwork to lead us to a successful round of funding; with others that meant a quality product launch, a full-scale beta development, or a much-needed strategic pivot. In all cases, the guidance was invaluable. The course is also structured very well for what it strives to accomplish. I enjoyed how it incorporated a facet devoted to advancing your personal start-up and a facet allowing the whole group to get to know each other and learn about entrepreneurship together. I would say it's one of the best courses at Harvard, but these days every student and his dog touts that statement on this guide. So rather than another baseless statement, at the end of the day consider the following. Take this course to personally develop as an entrepreneur, to reap success for your start-up faster and more effectively than you could ever do independently, and to learn from a legend.","This class is a chance to follow your dreams with help from a great professor.","If you're interested in doing a start up and currently have an idea\/are working on something, this is a great class to give you the flexibility to manage academics and your personal entrepreneurial goals. Bottino is a great mentor and your classmates will all share your passion for start ups. The class becomes a great resource. \r\n\r\nYou will get as much as you put into this class out of it. It is really helpful to learn how to effectively use your time. With no class requirements, you have to hold yourself accountable or you'll find yourself frustrated at the end of the semester.","This is an awesome class to take if you want to take your idea to the next level. Paul is extremely helpful and really invests himself in your project.","Make sure the startup is something you are passionate about and something you are willing to work with through ups and downs. This class gives a lot of freedom so make sure you structure your time wisely and keep to it in a disciplined way. It's a great environment to learn many, many things about startups and about yourself if you are willing to work hard and take risks."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is great for any student that is running a startup. It makes balancing startup work and class work much easier by essentially taking one class off of your schedule. Paul also really cares about the class and the teams. Be prepared to have to thrive independently, however. Also, I have no idea how this class is graded. Upon writing this, we have not yet received grades and I have honestly no idea whether or not I am going to get an A or a B.","Great course. Take it if you seriously want to work on your startup. Prepare to be self-motivated though. You'll receive valuable feedback and guidance, but at the end of the day you have to initiate things on your own.","Be prepared to be in charge of your own schedule.","This class is as easy or hard as you want to make it. If you care about your project, which most (or all) of us did, it is awesome and you will get a lot of work done. Being given credit to work on a start-up that you are passionate about is such a great opportunity.","After 2 semesters in the class, I can safely say that ES95r has been my best experience at Harvard.  Without this class, I would never have been able to devote enough time into my startup to make it a reality. However, in addition to freeing up time in your schedule, the class provides amazing resources, in the form of one-on-one meetings with Paul, guest speakers, and group discussions. If you have a startup that you're already working on, or an idea that you're passionate about turning into a real company, take this class! However, don't think that this is a class if you're not ultra serious about your startup - even if you do get accepted into the class, you will quickly stand out from your highly driven, entrepreneurial peers.","This course provides a great avenue for learning about the various aspects of launching a start-up: funding, customer development, marketing, etc.","This is an incredible course and Paul is a tremendous teacher and instructor. I have learned an enormous amount from him through ES95r. The course has given me the ability to think further through my ideas and refine my approach to building a startup. No other course exists at Harvard like ES95r and I highly recommend the class to anyone considering pursuing an idea or venture.","Only take this course if you are working on a venture and can't find enough time in your class schedule to work on it. Otherwise, it's probably not the best use of your time.","Great opportunity to get credit for working on an independent startup. Appears to work best if you have already created a product and are in the launch\/marketing stage.","This class was easily one of the best I've taken at Harvard, and with the most practical application. If you are working on a startup, or have an idea for a startup, and would like to stick with it over the course of the semester then I strongly recommend checking out this course and seeing if it is a good fit.\r\nI cannot speak enough about how useful and cool this class is.  You get to work on your idea, get feedback from others, and help them with their projects. Learning about the different stages of the process and having the systems in place for learning more is terrific, and I know that I learned skills this semester that will help me well-beyond college.","If you have a startup, this is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to work on it for course credit. How much you actually get out of the course will depend heavily on your own level of commitment and discipline - but if you can prioritize your startup over your other commitments and obligations (something that comes easily to entrepreneur in us but is difficult for the Harvard student in us), then you won't regret taking this course. The extra bandwidth is invaluable if you're trying to manage (or start) a startup during the semester, and it's also great to be part of a community of like-minded students who are facing similar challenges. My only regret is not being more disciplined myself, but a big part of the course experience is learning how to rely on yourself and your team as opposed to the external pressures and deadlines to which we're so accustomed. With that in mind, I will definitely be applying for a second semester, and would encourage you to do the same if you've got a startup that you need time to work on."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Only take this class if you're really passionate about startups and have an idea that you really care about pursuing. There are no assignments or deadlines - everything that you do in this class is entirely on you. That being said, it's a waste of a course if you end the semester having accomplished nothing. Really leverage the advising resources and working space to bring your startup (or idea) forward. Only make the commitment to take this course if you know that you'll be able to devote ample time and energy to working on your startup, because it's very easy to fall into the trap of devoting more time to your other 3 classes given that this course has no homework. Make a strategic plan with specific milestones and work to achieve them. You don't have to get accepted to YC to make the best out of this class.","If you're going to take one course at harvard, make it this course.","Just take it. Think of something to create and make it happen for yourself with the amazing support of the Eng 95r team","This class is really different from other ones at Harvard in that it is completely self-driven. There are no real assignments or tasks, but it is up to you to push your startup idea and resolve any complications as they arise. It's inspiring to see what all the other startup teams are doing and in general is an incredibly fun and interesting course.","take it if you are or want to be an entrepreneur","If you're interested in being part of a start-up, this class will help you find time in your schedule to devote to your project, which is really important.  Most of what you learn will come from your own experiences working on the start-up, which is by design; however, the classroom component was sometimes tedious.  I think more structure would have made class time more productive.","Great class to find time to work on your startup idea, though the class meetings themselves are occasionally less useful","For those who are driven to create a company or execute on an idea with or without guidance.","Paul is an excellent resource and gives very good advice. The class portion of the course is missable and many of the members of the class do not put in enough work to make their contributions helpful.","If you are on the fence about launching a start-up, just pitch to get into the course. You get to meet other Harvard students working on start-ups around campus and learn from them, as well as benefit from the resources given you (meeting space, guest lecturers). It can only help.","This class turned my venture's business concept into an endeavor I will pursue over the summer-- I can't even compare where we were at the beginning of the semester to where we are today. Paul is a phenomenal instructor who cares deeply for students and their concepts. He is a priceless resource to us all, and the enthusiasm of the other students who enroll is nothing short of infectious. If you've got an idea-- go for it."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you are passionate about starting a company and very self driven then this is the perfect class for you.","This is the best course I've ever taken at Harvard, hands-down and bar none. The fact that it exists is a testament to the excellence of Paul Bottino as an instructor and mentor, and every student with even the slightest inclination toward entrepreneurship should seriously consider joining Startup R&D. It's more than a class-- it's an unparalleled opportunity to do something incredible with your undergraduate education. If you're in doubt, go for it.","1.  If you want to work on a startup while at Harvard, take this course. \n2.  If you won't to have the most educational experience of your career, found a startup while at Harvard.\n3.  If you followed 2, then refer to 1.","This is a great class. While it might not offer all of the concrete backing you might be looking for to help guide the creation of your startup, it will provide you with an environment to solidify your ideas and talk with like minded people. Overall this is a great class if you want to pursue a startup of any kind.","thought some of the meetings were not super productive and kind of a waste of time, but it was nice talking with other students who were facing similar problems with their ventures.","If you are pursuing or wish to pursue a startup idea, this is a wonderful forum to do so.  Professor Bottino is a really awesome professor and he really cares about you and your startup.  For me, ES95 was a great class because I was already doing all the work needed for the class before taking it.  Highly recommended to anyone interested in pursuing their own idea.","Gave me the mental space to dedicate more time to my start up and make some real progress this semester.  I spent a huge number of hours a week working on \"this course\" but what that really means is that I was working on my start up. All the work for this class were things that I needed to be doing for my business anyway (e.g. putting together a pitch). It was also really exciting to be in a class with other students working on start ups who could relate to the thoughts\/feelings\/emotions I was going through.","Take class if you need the extra time to work on a project","Paul Bottino is amazing. He has helped encourage so many students to pursur their entrepreneurial dreams.","If you have a startup, its nice that this course takes up an academic to work on it.","This is a fantastic class if you have a startup idea and want to have a structured space and time to let it take off","An easy class, yes, with absolutely no assignments. But an incredibly valuable one too.","Bottino is amazing and will provide the guidance and advice you need when things are going smoothly or not quite so smoothly","Awesome opportunity, but you have to really care about your idea. You'll get out what you put in. Work hard ~ at least ten hours a week, and you'll do well.","It is a great experience but only do this class if you are actually going to work on your start-up. Try to take step forwards and listen to the feedback from Mr. Bottino because it is very helpful.","This course is a good for giving you time to work on a startup. You sacrifice 2 hours a week to useless activities in the classroom, but get to work on your startup otherwise.","If you've got a startup that you're truly serious about working on, this is the class for you! You'll get excellent advice from both your peers and Mr. Bottino, and the class has pretty much no workload so you'll get extra time to work on your startup!","Startup R&D is a great opportunity to work on a start-up and get great advice."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"27","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ENG-SCI 95r","course_id":"5288","cat_num":"60126","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"6","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ENG-SCI 95r","course_id":"5288","cat_num":"60126","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ENG-SCI 95r","course_id":"5288","cat_num":"60126","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"9"}},"success":true}
