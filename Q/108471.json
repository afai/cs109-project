No matter how tenuous the connection of your own research with the topic of this seminar, you're sure to come away with something very useful.","I would recommend this class to anyone interested in anime and\/or media theory. I found it incredibly enlightening, and it was a great way to become familiar with concepts not traditionally covered in courses on Japan. The materials are quite good, although the readings can be difficult, especially if you are not familiar with film theory. You will need to put a good amount of work into the weekly readings to make sure you really understand them. That said, professor Zahlten is a tremendous resource if you are having trouble understanding something. He has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the subject matter, and talking with him is incredibly helpful and enjoyable.","Since media mix studies is in many ways still a very emergent field, this class requires a certain flexibility with regard to approaching and thinking about the material, but in that sense it is very rewarding in return."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.67","workload":"2.67","difficulty":"3.67","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"3","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EAFM 201","course_id":"819","cat_num":"91266","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EAFM 201","course_id":"819","cat_num":"91266","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EAFM 201","course_id":"819","cat_num":"91266","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
