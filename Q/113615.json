'08":{"comments":["this is a great introduction to game theory and social choice at the graduate level. You will not find a better course at harvard that is as solid an introduction as this one.","I just recommended it to a fellow graduate student yesterday. The lectures are engaging and accessible, and the professors strike a good balance between theory and practice. Both Chris Avery and Nolan Miller are not only extremely smart people and accomplished researchers, but also great teachers - a rare combination.","Get ready for an amazing ride in one of the most fascinating and insightful Economic subjects. Put in the due diligence for this class and you'll come out with a new way of looking at the world and understanding.","If you're at all interested in game theory, information, incentives, voting, you should definitely take this class. The teaching is excellent and you learn a lot of material over the year. Assignments are not stressful but are very challenging, and it is well worth working on them in groups and \"teaching\" each other. Overall an excellent class! I really enjoyed it.","It is a lot of work and is very theory-driven.  However, the subject matter is challenging and interesting, and the course is very well-taught.","If you're serious learning about economics, but are not prepared for the intense mathematical proofs you'll see in Econ 2010 series, go ahead and take this one.","Difficult class, but worth the work because it really helps you feel more comfortable with economic models that can be applied to work in political economy. Great even if you have had exposure to game theory before."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["The second half is especially difficult, and I would urge students to check who is teaching the second half and use the Nolan Miller notes throughout.","It's a lot of work, but you'll definitely learn the material well."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["A good graduate-level microeconomics course.  Do the problem sets, read the lecture notes when you can, and go to section.  Do lots of practice problems until you understand how to approach the problem.","A good introduction to game theory and information economics, but the lectures leave something to be desired.","I would emphasize that it is analytically rigorous but highly applicable to real world scenarios."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Great for brushing up on undergrad econ.  Not sufficiently advanced to prepare you for economic modeling as a career choice.","this course is very math-intensive and you should have some econ background before enrolling in this course or else you will be lost","Don't fall behind and don't miss lecture.  I missed two (out of 20+) lectures, and it took immense effort to catch back up","If you are looking for a rigorous grounding in microeconomic theory then this course does not try to provide this. It is also not a sufficiently powerful course to make taking further Economics courses easy. That may be useful for understanding economics or enhancing modelling skills in other disciplines. Nevertheless, the course is good at explaining and illustrating the key concepts used in micro.","I'd recommend it as it is well taught, but warn anyone taking it to make sure to have taken some other Econ first. Don't make this your first Econ class.","It's a very helpful class, and the instructors and TAs are clearly very concerned with the students.","Be good with math.  Do the problem sets and at least some of the practice problems along the way.","Take an introductory microeconomics class before embarking in this course.","Find a study group and do all the review problems and you will be fine.  I don't think this class actually taught me enough economics to do any econ theory in a dissertation paper, but it did give me enough knowledge to creditably talk to economists and possibly even understand economic papers."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It is hard to say I would not recommend this course because most take it as a requirement, so you must take it. However, if there was an alternative I would strongly suggest looking into it.","Poorly taught course (Jemison + Kohlberg), but a requirement. Strong disconnect between lectures (not engaging), problem sets, and exams. Does not help with economic\/game theoretical intuition. You may need to study game theory on your own independently during\/after the semester.","The best way to learn how to read microecon papers and have a chance of understanding what's going on."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Need to develop intuition on your own, to some extent.","Take lots of math, and come prepared with some game theory under your belt.","If you have some economics background, it is a great class to train your way of viewing the world.","Very rewarding course which puts you up to speed in micro theory. This in turn underpins a lot of the discussions in all walks of academia","I would recommend this course with one qualification - it is an excellent introduction to game theory and information economics, but it may not be particularly challenging for someone with background in the area."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You can get a lot out of the notes if you read carefully and do the problem sets by yourself. Ask Elon and Chris for help; they are very willing and capable!","Good course. It is worthwhile to do the homeworks.","This is really what an introductory graduate level course on microeconomic theory should be. Yes, there is math, and if you want rigor you can make it as rigorous as you'd like. However, the focus is on the intuition of game theory and information economics, of everything from the basics of Nash equilibria to screening equilibria in asymmetric information. Highly recommended for non-Econ PhD students who require greater-than-undergraduate knowledge in micro for their research. (Econs will need their 2010 sequence, but that's just the unfortunate culture they live in.)","This is a hard course but you'll learn a lot! Do all the problem sets even though they may not count for your grade.","This course is a good introduction to game theory and information economics, with the latter half taught better than the former. I'm leaving the course seeing many aspects of my life as games, which is both a good and a bad thing (c.f. \"The Dark Knight\" and \"A Beautiful Mind,\" in that order). \r\n\r\nYou will begin with the basics of game theory, including a number of solution concepts: Nash, Subgame Perfect, Bayes\u00e2\u20ac\u201cNash, and Perfect Bayesian equilibrium. You will then proceed to adverse selection, signaling, moral hazard, and a bit of social choice theory. \r\n\r\nChris's lecture notes are very good. The homework was of appropriate length and difficulty, albeit sometimes a bit repetitive. The exams were very fair. \r\n\r\nI would have liked a bit more theory in the course, but I guess that's not the point of 2020. I also would have liked a bit more connective tissue between the first and second halves, as I'm still not sure exactly how certain topics in information economics relate to games.","This course moves very slowly for students who have a strong interest in microeconomic theory. Still, the material presented is very important and the lectures were very insightful. You'll learn something, but I think the course can push students much harder.","Good for intuition or introduction to game theory, bad for deeper understanding or modelling","An intro to game theory may be very helpful for econ research. Chris is an excellent teacher and wonderful resource. His notes are very clear. Elon is well-known in the field, from what I hear, and probably an expert with a long-term perspective on the field, but his teaching can be slow, disorganized, and confusing at times. Then again, I may have understood lectures better if I had done readings ahead of time, because it is difficult to quickly process the set-up for problems and work through them in class.","Game theory is a very useful toolkit for economics research and any PhD candidate in economics should know at least to know the key concepts and be capable to read papers published in non-game theory economics journals that use some game theoretic concepts. The course in its current form is not well organized and does not meet that goal. While the professors and TFs are nice and answer questions during and after class, there is a major conceptual gap between the first and second halves of the course (pre\/post midterm), the section component of the course is not taught to the level that it would actually be useful for homework, and the quality of lecture materials varies a lot. Feedback on homework was generally late and minimal. Course felt a bit of an experiment this year. The course also feels rushed and almost as if it only taught a few examples of game theory problems and a few concepts but not sufficiently to do research. There was little connection between this course and Micro I (the Fall term course) so not clear why the two are in a sequence or how this course builds a solid base together with Micro I."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.20","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"3.30","enrollment":"37","response rate":"78.38","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 2020b","course_id":"1016","cat_num":"4058","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"7","4s":"11","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 2020b","course_id":"1016","cat_num":"4058","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"13","4s":"9","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 2020b","course_id":"1016","cat_num":"4058","1s":"4","2s":"10","3s":"12","4s":"2","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
