I am thoroughly enjoying it.","Get ready for the singing. The singing is fun, but also kind of disconcerting at first!","While class is good, you must take a good deal of iniative to learn on your own outside of class to really pick up the language.","not as structured as some other language classes, but still gives you a good idea of the beginning of swahili","I would recommend this course (with the minor qualification that it can be disorganized at times)."]},"Spring '08":{"comments":["Only take if serious about learning Swahili.","Be prepared for a terrible language class.

She makes me want to move to Tanzania. She is one of those people who just flow with positive energy. You will learn not just Swahili, but an incredible culture. I end up procrastinating on other homework by studying Swahili. Another great thing about Swahili is that it makes sense. There are few exceptions and you will be able to say quite a lot already by semester,  so it is great for those who struggle with languages. There is usually a one sided sheet for homework, which takes maybe half an hour, and quizzes every other Friday. You learn songs and will begin using Swahili in daily conversations, and all your friends will be jealous that you are in such an amazing language class!","Swahili is a great language, Prof. Mmari is a wonderful prof, and East Africa is a great place to visit - even better if you know Swahili!","This class is excellent for anyone to take regardless of your backround.

I sincerely look forward to going to class.","This class is awesome!  You learn a lot, but the pace is only as fast as people learn; no one gets left behind.  Also, the professor, TF, and CAs are great: they're always around to answer questions and give extra help.","Excellent class taught by an amazing teacher."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It's a really fun class, but you have to be prepared to be flexible. There is not a lot of structure in the class, and it takes a lot of outside work to truly learn the language and become a better speaker\/reader. Despite this, the interactions with Professor Mugane are well worth it.","This is a great class.  Not only do you learn Swahili, but you are taught about African culture and the importance of African Languages.  If you are interested in African culture, meeting a foreign language requirement or just looking for something different take this class!","this class is extremely unstructured - the lessons are unpredictable, grammar is not taught clearly, there are no vocabulary units, and the assignments\/exams are random. the class experience was enjoyable, but the overall course wasn't rigorous & the grades are horrible.","This is an easy and interesting introduction to the Swahili language. Students taking this class should be laid back and willing to go with the flow about assignments. You will learn a lot, including fun songs from East Africa.","Be prepared for a huge jump from first semester to second semester. First semester very manageable and even enjoyable; second semester was incredibly stressful and difficult. If you are flexible with some disorganization but are really invested in this course and are truly excited about learning Swahili, you will enjoy this class.","I benefitted from the course from doing independent work so I felt more challenged.  Taking advantage of resources like the TFs and Swahili table are very good for language learning.","This is a fun class in which you will learn a lot of swahili if you do the work.  I would recommend taking it, though, only if you have a reason to do so.  I have lived in East Africa and plan to return, so the class was perfect for me.  But there were some students who just took it randomly, and while some enjoyed it, some lacked the connection to the culture that created incentives to actually learn the language.","I loved Swahili A!  The second semester focused much more on reading and writing, with stories, songs, proverbs, and theater night; I really enjoyed getting to learn vocabulary and grammar through reading and singing.  Yes, the course may be a bit disorganized at times, but as long as you have a positive attitude and are willing to learn in unconventional ways, you will have a great semester.  Mzee Mugane and Nkatha are both very interesting and engaging, and you will learn a lot just from their stories.  Overall, not too much work and a good bit of fun!  This class was like a family at the end."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The environment is friendly and exciting. The atmosphere is very conducive to learning.","My favorite class of freshman fall! You learn swahili in such a fun way and Professor Mugane is brilliant as well as all the TFS.","Its probably one of the better language classes. Its not too had and first semester is mostly focused on grammar which isn't that hard. They ease you into the language and the midterm and finals were fair and not too hard.","If you are interested at all in Swahili or African Culture, take this class! Dr. Mugane creates an environment in which it is relaxing and fun to learn the language. You will not only learn Swahili but also how to learn languages. If you are looking for a fun, interesting was to fulfill your language requirement or are looking to really learn Swahili, this course is definitely worthwhile.","The class is stimulating, fun, and not work-heavy. Professor Mugane is a very entertaining speaker, and keeps students on their toes throughout class.","it is a fun way to actually learn a lot -- highly recommend","Swahili A is a fun, engaging class that anyone can enjoy if they are willing to participate and dedicate themselves to learning the language. Professor Mugane and the section leaders are all incredibly helpful and devoted to helping all of the students master the language. They create a stress-free environment while still managing to teach and explain the various aspects of the language.","If you do the work and pay attention, this is a really easy class. It's also fun, we sing songs every friday.","An interesting and entertaining class. Sometimes difficult to understand, but section always clears up misunderstandings.","This is one of the best language courses I've ever taken. The coursework is easy without being a waste of time, and I actually feel like I've made a lot of progress with the language. Professor Mugane is excellent, as are the TAs. I would recommend this class to anyone.","This was my favorite class! I learned so much about the language and culture while also enjoying the class. Professor Mugane is one of the best in the college, and all the TFs are very helpful as well. I never felt that there wasn't a way for me to receive help if I ever needed it. African Theater Night is a blast and the midterms\/final are very reasonable. You will be surprised how much fun you can have while also learning a great deal of the language.","It is great and very enjoyable!","its an easy way to get out of a language requirement but if you intend on actually learning the language for whatever reason you will find it incredibly frustrating that doing well in this class does not necessarily mean that you are learning much.","A wonderful class and a great way to explore a beautiful language.","This class is horribly disorganized. Mugane teaches by call-and-response speaking, so if you can't follow new, long words in a foreign language, you will be confused all the time. The textbook is awful, none of the teaching staff responds to email in a timely matter (often no response at all). Expect to teach yourself a lot of the material - luckily, the material isn't inherently difficult. This class's teaching style is what makes it difficult.","Swahili's a really fun class, and Prof. Mugane is also a very amusing teacher. The class places emphasis on aural learning in-class, which I think is refreshing and more engaging. It is, however, not the best organized class and sometimes almost too lax about stuff, and can get boring in class some times. I don't think you'd really gain much from the class unless you actually really care to learn the language, whether that be for some semi-practical reason or because you think (learning) the language in and of itself is cool (which it is!). But if that is the case - then go for it."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Swahili is a beautiful language, and Swahili A is a pretty chill and fun course. Prof. Mugane is pretty awesome - perhaps a bit disorganized, but very interesting and dedicated to his teaching. If you just come in expecting to find an easy and painless way to satisfy the language requirement, I suppose you'll have some fun - but if you really care to learn Swahili and about East African culture, do take it!","Very fun class, not too difficult at all. The TFs and Professor are all awesome and super nice people, definitely a unique way to fill a language requirement. This is definitely a class I am going to miss.","This course is easy and very fun. Professor Mugane is amazing, funny, and engaging.","This class is a lot of fun! It is definitely a painless way to get through the language requirement. It could benefit from some more organization, but overall, it is still enjoyable. You leave being able to understand a surprisingly large amount of Swahili.","great class","A wonderful introduction. A great language to learn!","Be prepared to struggle if the way you learn best isn't the way Mugane teaches: if you need to see material written down, want substantive comments on the work you hand in, or are tone deaf then this class may not be right for you. If you tell the course staff that you'd appreciate it if they would try to incorporate more writing on the board into class (considering the class often went a week without writing down anything, so it was a reasonable request) they will first agree with you; then, when you bring it up during class (\"Professor, could you please write that down, I'm having trouble understanding you.\") they will first mock you (\"No, you shouldn't need that written down. Swahili is for the living!\")(apparently living people don't read...) then deny your request. Unless you do something drastic (complain to FDO, resident dean, etc), don't expect that the situation will ever improve. Mugane is set in his ways and insists that he knows better than you how you learn. \r\n\r\nAfter a year of being ignored, belittled, and publicly humiliated during the course of Swahili A, I cannot warn you away from this class enough. I did well in the class grade-wise because I put in at least triple the effort of others into studying for exams: this would have been unnecessary if the teaching staff (mainly Mugane) had been the least bit accommodating. Plus they mispronounced my name for the entire year even after many attempts to correct them - it's like they don't care at all.","Such a fun language! Definitely take this with Prof. Mugane.","This a great class to take to fulfill your language requirement. It's relatively easy but you still learn a lot and it's fun. Professor Mugane is a great teacher, and very accessible.","If you are planning on taking a language at Harvard, Swahili is a wonderful language to choose. The course's strengths include small class size, constant opportunities for participation, and fantastic teaching staff. Dr. Mugane, the head of the African Languages Department, directly teaches the course and is present at every lecture. Dr. Mugane takes great pains to get to know his students, learning not only their names but also learning about their lives and passions. This course is light, fun, and quite easy. You will learn a lot of Swahili, but you will also learn a lot about learning languages in general and a lot about African culture. This course presents students with several opportunities to use Swahili (including opportunities to study and work abroad). If you are interested in learning a language in a fun, laid-back, personal environment, this is not a course to miss out on.","First semester is really fun and the lack of structure isn't a problem; however, second semester is not quite as easy and you miss whole topics without even noticing you have been taught them.","This is a great class to take for your foreign language requirement. Helpful TF's and not too much work"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["I was told that this class was easy but found it to be the opposite. Although the course itself seems like it shouldn't be too difficult, the degree of disorganization makes it very difficult to succeed.","This class is a lot of fun, I always looked forward to it. The professor is caring about everyone in the class and how they are learning the material. If you reach out to him he will help.","The classes are fun but it was NOT an easy class. If you have friends in the class and you like learning languages you will probably really enjoy it. But like any language class it moves very quickly so remember to stay on top of everything. Also Professor Mugane is awesome but can be very unorganized.","This is possibly the most fun language class you can take at Harvard! It is very interesting, and not that difficult. Professor Mugane is hilarious and full of stories. If you need clear lesson plans and everything written down on the board, though, this class may be more challenging. But if you want to sing songs and have fun, this is a great class!","As someone that took a lot of languages in high school, this class seemed very familiar. Homework for each class, quizzes, and exams. The language is very interesting and not too difficult. That main factor to  contend with is the sometimes disorganized nature of the course. You may not know what information is required on a quiz\/exam and may not know for sure you have a quiz\/exam until a few days before. But the professor and the TF (Nanjala) are really nice and care a lot about their students.","Professor Mugane is amazing! Take this class to learn Swahili, and have a fantastic time while doing it. You won't regret a single moment.","I would recommend this course to anyone with a genuine interest to learn Swahili. Mugane is a fun professor, and he knows what he is talking about. The classes were a lot of fun, and we learned a lot of Swahili. The main issues that I had with the course included some homework assignments, and the lengthy, unfair exams. For example, I spent several hours preparing for our final exam and the studying helped me very little.","Keep up and you'll do fine. Not well organized, but that didn't bother me at all. Fun professor.","It's the best! The workload is very manageable, the class is very relaxed, and we get to sing swahili songs. It is the only class that I get actively excited about going to"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["While an interesting and important language to learn, the class's exams were extremely frustrating. It was hard to do well on the exams, and Professor Mugane's nonchalant attitude did not prepare me well for the exams.","I thought this class was really fun and Mugane is awesome! Also be aware that it isn't a joke class- be prepared to study as much as you would for any other language class. The class also has very little structure which can be both good and bad. Just make sure you're learning the vocabulary as you go. I suggest writing down any words that Mugane says that you don't know and learning them as you go, because there isn't any vocab list or anything. Also be prepared for everybody to ask you why you're taking Swahili.l","This class is a lot of fun and is very manageable. It doesn't go too fast, and we get to do things like learn songs, which is great!","Definitely one of my best classes at Harvard. I actually looked forward to Swahili class in the middle of a stressful week. Class environment is generally very fun and makes you excited to learn. My favourite part was definitely all the songs we learnt to sing!","This class can be a lot of fun, but be careful. It is not structured well. There are no vocab lists or quizzes, which makes it very easy to fall behind. And once you're behind it's almost impossible to catch up. You'll need to be disciplined and consistently study vocab and grammar concepts on your own, because the class won't force you to.","Professor Mugane is hilarious. That being said, it would have been nice to have more structure in the language instruction.","The professor and TF are great and the class is fun and not too difficult. Sometimes the material you need to know for exams was unclear.","pay a lot of attention in class and study a lot in the beginning of the year- even though it seems easy it gets hard really quickly and if you're behind it's almost impossible to catch up","Mugane is a great professor who made class fun! His teaching style is new, but very easy to adapt to. Expect to learn a lot about the Swahili language and Kenyan culture.","This is a fantastic class if you really want to get immersed in a language and a culture. You will learn so much more than mere vocabulary. However, be warned, if you need to learn languages through charts and grammar exercises, this class will be challenging for you. Professor Mugane is very intelligent and hilarious in class, but can be hard to keep up with at times."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["If you are a very organized person and you are looking for an organized class, don't take it. You have to be flexible.","This class is so incredibly easy if you just review what you did in class and do the homework consistently and regularly. You will learn a lot about Swahili, but I personally felt like I could have learned more if the class was taught in a less oral-focused method. Also, Professor Mugane is hilarious. If you're looking for a fun new language to learn that is actually pretty cool, I would recommend trying Swahili.","If you want to a learn a new language, with a rich cultural significance, then go for Swahili. \"Swahili is for the living\"","Be prepared to have a really interesting professor and spend a lot of time doing Swahili homework, but it definitely pays off in the end","This class is amazing! Take it!","Take this class.  It wasn't until sitting down for the final that I realized how much we had covered in the course because learning was fun and interesting."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Swahili A is a great class to take for your Foreign language requirement but also as an elective or if you wanna be taught by the finest teacher in this institution and of course, if you wanna travel to East Africa as well.","It's a great class and an awesome way to fulfill the language requirement","This class is a lot of fun and is really easy. Quite probably the easiest class you will find at Harvard. You will learn a substantial amount of Swahili, but not nearly as much as other kids are learning in intro language courses."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["It's a very fun language to learn, good for getting the language requirement out of the way.","Swahili A with Mugane is really fun, a chill class, and a good way to familiarize yourself with East African languages. The class has very little structure - Mugane will just kinda talk and say some words in Swahili before you understand what he is actually trying to teach, but overall, the lessons are great. He also tries to teach a bit about East African\/Bantu culture, which is great.","Mugane is the man. He knows what he's doing and provides a fun and stimulating learning environment.","This is a really fun course that is extremely relaxed. You also learn A LOT which is a nice plus!","This Swahili class is a pretty fun (and relatively low-stress) way of learning a language! Professor Mugane is very fun to learn Swahili from- he's hilarious, but I think what really made the class great was the TF, Sarah. Professor Mugane can sometimes be unclear in lecture, but Sarah cleared up these confusions and put in so much extra effort to make sure that we understood all the concepts. She's the most hard-working TF I've ever had at Harvard! She and Professor Mugane meet often to talk about the class, and it's very clear that they both really care about the student's learning. If there's something that most of the class doesn't understand, then Sarah and Professor Mugane put the blame on themselves and then work to make sure that we understand it. I'm not sure if Sarah will be TF'ing again next fall semester- in the spring '15 semester, she's actually going to be TF'ing a different course.","Great, low-intensity language. Professor Mugane is an awesome teacher.","learn your vocab","Awesome course, Mugane is a great teacher! Very doable with a few hours of work a week. The class is meant to teach you, not to be overly difficult. Thanks for everything!","The teaching staff is wonderful and makes you really want to learn the language. The homework and exams are directly correlated with what is going on in class, meaning no surprises. It's a great class!","If you have no experience with African languages and will never take another, try Swahili. It's not that hard, and Prof. Mugane is a lot of fun. If you have any knowledge of another Bantu language, this course will be really slow and easy for you--but it will still be fun. Ask the course staff to push you and challenge you: I did, and it paid off."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"4.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"18","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SWAHILI A","course_id":"96","cat_num":"1878","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SWAHILI A","course_id":"96","cat_num":"1878","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SWAHILI A","course_id":"96","cat_num":"1878","1s":"1","2s":"12","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
