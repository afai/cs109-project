'08":{"comments":["Very interesting course and showcases just how complicated neural circuitry is.","good low-workload course to fulfill concentration requirements, but be prepared for annoying pop quizzes","Anyone interested in neuroscience who wants to learn about the biological bases of real behaviors, not just action potentials, etc.  This course will expose you to many interesting areas of research, hopefully one or more will catch your interest.","Great class, interesting material, wonderful professor. Quizzes are worth too much though (50%!), and are often very difficult.","I would recommend this course only for students who are very interested in learning systems through model organisms. The detail level of this course switched between intensely detailed to intensely vague, so be forewarned.","This class is amazing. The papers are really groundbreaking results and are a must to read for any neurobio concentrator. Professor Engert is incredibly entertaining and engaging in lectures. The material itself is really good and provides a fair survey of systems neuroscience.","Great way to learn about different model systems used in neuroscience","be prepared for the quizzes","The class is a comfortably informal survey of important topics in systems neuroscience.  The material is interesting, but the heavy reliance on primary literature gets pretty dry and complicated.","It's a really interesting course, but it's a bit disorganized.  It's also hard to understand what to focus on.","Great general introduction to how neuronal circuits are studied, MCB80 not really required. However, the course isn't all that organized.","I learned a lot and the workload was light, but the material was very difficult.","I would recommend this course for people who are interested in neurobiology.","It's fun, interesting, and has a very manageable workload. The professor and TFs are very friendly and interested in teaching well.","You never know from one day to the next what will be expected of you. One day they talk about very simple concepts and you can't stay awake in lecture, and then in the very next section you may feel completely overwhelmed the entire time because of how complex the subject matter is."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Great class.","it's full of interesting material and the sections are extremely fun and helpful. Hope it stays that way now that Florian has tenure (kidding)","Florian is amazing.","This course would be interesting to anyone, no matter your concentration or specific research interest.  The material and teaching staff are really fun, and make the class fun.  I would recommend this class as an introduction to neurobio instead of a larger, more anonymous course, if you think your have a pretty strong biochem background.","Read the papers early, carefully, and twice.","very interesting, informative, and a lot of fun","It's a hard class, but you will learn cool things and how to read a research paper.","Take this course!","The course is good and the professor is fun, but some materials are a little overlapped with other mcb neurobiology courses"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Definitely a great course to take if you're interested in the subject matter, just be realistic with your prior knowledge and background in neuroscience so you know coming in how hard you're going to have to work to keep up.","The weekly quizzes can be a bit tough and the paper was definitely a challenge, however, I learned a lot of critical thinking skills from the course.","This class is one of the best MCB classes out there. Florian is an engaging lecturer, and the material is really interesting. There is little assigned work. That being said, however, Florian actually expects his students to think critically; additionally, experiments in systems neuroscience rely on creative and critical design, which of course, to understand their purpose, one must be able to follow. These combined make the class more difficult than other MCB classes, but I think it's worth it. You will definitely gain an appreciation for non molecular or cellular approaches to understanding neurobiology that other courses do not offer in any subfield of biology.","excellent tfs, excellent lectures. really interesting material. refreshing course grading policy. FLORIAN IS SO COOL!","My favorite class, even though by far my most challenging and probably the one that I got my worst grade in...","Great class, take it!","This class will teach you how to read scientific papers. If you don't have experience with them you will have to put in a lot of effort to keep up and get on the same level with the other students. Lectures are interesting and the work only really piles up at the end of the year with a final exam and final project.","The course I believe is the better option between MCB 115 and 105 for neurobiology concentrators, but be aware that there is a significant amount of work required at the end of the year, and that the weekly quizzes are rather difficult.","This class is harder than it seems from the syllabus--the quizzes are pretty hard and the final project is kind of intense. But the material is interesting and overall throughout the semester there isn't too much work.","Read the quizzes very very carefully cause they are difficult. Learn how to read papers early. Also go to lecture it actually helps","Study for the quizzes with a friend","Material is both very interesting as well as fundamental for a good foundation in neuroscience.  I recommend it for all neurobio concentrators.","if you are a neuro concentrator, and you don't already have a really strong neuro background, you will learn an enormous amount of useful material from this solid intermediate level course. however, it is sometimes difficult","A good broad introduction to animal models and methods of research. Likely to be very helpful for underclassmen who are considering research and want a broad sampling of systems level work.","It's tough, but if you put in the time and make use of Florian and the TFs, there's a wealth of information to be learned.","The class is pretty relaxed - one lecture and one section per week.  The homework is generally to read two papers per week (to be quizzed about in section). Florian is a very engaging lecturer, and all the TFs are extremely smart and helpful. I highly recommend this.","do the readings twice each!","This class is great as long as you are interested in the subject, willing to work hard, and realize that the quizzes and paper will be more stressful and difficult than they seem.","This class contains all the fun parts of neurobiology. The original papers may be difficult to understand (especially for those not used to reading science papers) but what you learn always makes for great discussions with friends later.","The material is very interesting but the quizzes are extremely hard and are extremely difficult if you are not a neuroscience concentrator.","Form a study group. My section did, and it helped a lot.","You'll get to read a lot of fantastic primary literature, and have the background you need from lecture to make it understandable.","Engert and the TA's have a great passion for research. This class covers alot of ground, but the material is enjoyable.","This is a great upper division course that should be taken after some neurobiology preparation.","read the papers thoroughly, and more than once"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The quizzes are difficult in this class, but as long as the papers are read carefully then it should be fine.","The faculty provided almost no support if you're struggling. The benefits of this course is that you get a lot of experience reading and engaging with scientific articles. I feel like I learned a lot but I mostly had to teach myself.","It's interesting but be prepared to read lots of papers and know them fairly well.","Really interesting material that teaches you a lot of cool things about your brain - getting a good TF or building a good study group is important though.","It is a good advanced neuroscience course to take. You should constantly keep up with the lecture material and articles.","This course started off very interesting, yet because of the lack of information in the field, we were unfortunately limited to examine multiple unrelated snippets of information, many already seen in MCB 80, yet in much more detail. Professor Engert is one of my favorite professors, and he will find ways to make lectures very interesting by bringing up deep thoughts, making interesting activities, or tell a funny story. Having sections during the lecture time slot also freed up a good amount of time too. Overall, pretty solid class.","This class is a lot of work and you really have to pay attention to do well.  The topics are really interesting though! If you take this class make sure you take great notes during lecture and stay organized. Also, go over your lecture notes from that week before you read your section paper","The quizzes are really hard - try to talk to your TF about the papers before section, this improved my grade significantly.  Professor Engert is kind of crazy in an entertaining way but annoyingly difficult to get in contact with.  He claims he loves questions in class, but he is definitely more interested in \"communicating\" with grad students than with undergrads.","take notes in lecture and form a study group for the weekly quizzes","Not very organized, unfortunately. The topics are interesting, but the lectures aren't tied to the papers, and some lectures aren't very cohesive either.","MCB 105 is basically a rehashing of MCB 80, but more in depth and with a discussion of advanced research methods.  Florian is an interesting lecturer, and if you have a good group of students in your section then section discussions can be very interesting.  The weekly quizzes are unnecessarily hard, so I highly recommend reading the papers twice and taking notes the second time -- it will also serve as a pre-made study guide for the final!  Start early on the final project if possible - it takes a lot of time and thought.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading the weekly papers and studying for quizzes.","This course is difficult, but rewarding and very interesting.","You get what you put in to this course. You can just passively sit through lecture and skim the papers each week, but you won't learn a lot. You have to commit yourself to understanding the material and taking a critical scientific approach to it, then the course will be rewarding.","While MCB 105 is somewhat of a logistical disaster, the topics covered are quite interesting, and reading primary literature is a valuable experience. Professor Engert is extremely enthusiastic, lots of fun, and very chill. He clearly loves what he teaches. Just take EXCELLENT notes in class or you will kick yourself when you get to the final--the slides have no text on them and are therefore useless. Also, the quizzes are not just testing whether you've read the papers--be sure to know them in considerable detail each week.","Make sure you feel comfortable reading research papers before going into this class.","A good overview of model systems in neuroscience with excellent opportunities to develop ability in critiquing current scientific papers. TFs and course organiser are engaging.","The information is interesting and informative. I especially like when behaviors are explained by specific neuronal pathways.  Florian is enthusiastic about the material and provides engaging lectures.","Read papers more than once.","The reading quizzes are pretty difficult (unreasonably). It's almost as if you have to know the readings inside out before section has even happened. Lectures are extremely disorganized and hard to follow, even though the material is interesting. You won't know what you actually need to for the exam. The exam was also ridiculously long, though it was curved. The final project provided a fun chance to study something in systems neuro that is interesting to you. That was a fun experience. You also learn quite a bit in section."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["The workload throughout the semester is not too difficult, but the final exam and paper are incredibly stressful. Be sure to take good lecture notes throughout the year, as the slides are not useful on their own.","Lots of very interesting lectures - go to them!","Almost certainly the most fun neuroscience course at Harvard.","It is a great overview of systems neuroscience.","Take notes on the papers. The quizzes aren't awful, but you need to be comfortable with the experimental procedure, concepts, and major findings. As in, don't just be able to spit back quotes; sometimes you need to flexibly use the information.\r\nStart the final project early.","It's literature heavy. Be prepared to read and reread a few papers every week. Also, don't procrastinate the final paper.","The course is interesting, but unstructured. Little is truly learned beyond MCB80-levels, except for select phenomena in a few different model animals. Lectures offer little value-added.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's pretty easy. With 1 quiz\/week and a final paper\/exam, it's an easy way to knock out an advanced neuro class.","Do not take this class unless you are very familiar with scientific papers and with neuro in general. Also don't take it if you don't have to, the assignments at the end of the semester (paper AND final) are both impossible.","The course material for the class is really interesting, but the course lacks a solid structure -- if you are someone who needs a class to be really organized in order to get something out of it, this might not be the ideal class for you! But, if you are able to organize the information in your head yourself, then it is a really great class -- I personally got a lot out of it!","This class was extremely painful. It's really not fun. Lectures are boring and the professor is just not engaging and doesn't give effective lectures despite clearly having a wealth of knowledge. The final is pretty challenging because it goes off lectures too which are as noted before, awful. The final project is also a huge pain for which I feel there is limited support given for.","Take time to prepare for the section quizzes and start your paper early at the end of the semester.","The class involves a terrifying amount of dedication in order to do well. We have quizzes every week, and they are SUPER difficult, and are graded extremely stringently. You WILL do terribly on them. There is very little organization during lectures, for the class overall, and for class materials. You will feel overwhelmed, and you will feel like you are never doing well. However, there is a lot of very interesting information covered in this class, at a pretty good level of detail, so it is worth taking to broaden your understanding of neurobiological systems. It is sad, though, that the class is so poorly run.","It felt like taking OEB 57 all over again, but this time the quizzes were harder...","This class will teach you a lot about Systems Neurobiology, and Professor Engert and the TF's know so much about the field.  Make sure that you keep up with the material and take really detailed class\/section notes for the final.  Also the weekly quizzes are tough so make sure that you really understand the assigned papers before you go to section, and ask your TF's for help if you need it!  Do not let yourself get behind in this course!","This is a very interesting course. Its mostly for undergrads but non-neuroscience grad students will find this course to be a great mix of reading and discussion without the nuisance of problem sets.","Between MCB105 and 115, I would still choose 105 because the subject matter is very interesting, and the course is well constructed. By the end of the course, the major themes of how to apply systems neurobiology to various animal models was very clear. I also thought that the papers were great and added to the material covered in lecture.","It's a lot of memorization for the final, and the section papers can be dense, but you learn a lot and if you memorize things well the final really isn't that hard.","It has great material, and make sure you get Eva as a tf--she's great! However, the course itself is very frustrating due to the weekly quizes, which are very time-consuming and don't leave you understanding how much you know in the course (because of the lack of feedback). You will feel like you struggle the whole way through the course, but go to office horus or presection whenever you can and ask questions, and you will get the gist of the material.","Super super interesting. Eva is a fantastic TF, Florian is a fantastic professor. Together they present interesting and stimulating material that reminds you why the mind is a fascinating mystery worth studying.","the course covers some interesting material and is also a requirement, however take REALLY good and detailed notes during lecture and section\/paper readings because the class is not always very clear in telling you what you need to know","This course has the potential to be very interesting, but poor organization and incoherent lectures make it difficult to follow\/understand. Also, it takes a long time to prepare for weekly quizzes, so plan accordingly! I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are a neuro concentrator in which case you have no choice. G'luck!","The lectures give a good overview of systems neuroscience, but I feel like there are better-organized lectures for other classes. At the same time, I learned a lot about systems neuro and the relevant experimental approaches, and I enjoyed the section component and would highly recommend using them as a resource if you take the course.","Difficult class, but really interesting if you like neurobiology.","read the papers carefully, and make sure you don't get behind in the reading\/course work."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Taking it senior can be fun. you'll be familiar with a lot of examples. The details of the papers can be hard to pick up if you haven't read papers before.","A great class to learn about systems neuroscience. I came into the class not knowing what to expect, but I ended up enjoying it thoroughly","The class material was definitely interesting, as were the papers we had to read for each section. The weekly quizzes were a necessary evil, and something you get used to. I did feel like the course caused me a lot more stress during reading period, with the final paper and the final. Reviewing for the final was a bit painful at times since the lecture slides were mostly pictures.","Start thinking about your paper early. Try to pay close attention in class and in lecture.Don't leave everything for the last week becuase otherwise it can be a little scary to know that 50% of your grade is determined that week.","Go to lecture. The slides are meaningless without personal notes. Also, make use of the Kandel textbook! It helps to fill in gaps in your notes and explains things nicely.","If you think you would enjoy learning about the systems-level neuroscience topics covered in previous years' lectures, then don't do yourself the disservice of second-guessing yourself -- take this class!!! The concepts covered in this class are truly fascinating and open your eyes to areas of neuroscience research that are exciting, elegant and inspiring for those students who might be considering neuroscience research for their future. The research papers assigned for reading are difficult but are well worth the effort for deepening a student's practical understanding of systems neuroscience.","Start the final project really early. You can essentially start at any time, no one lecture is ridiculously crucial to doing it.","Good class, good material, can be a bit difficult, don't fall behind, nicely organized class with half section and half lecture","I loved the lectures! Systems neuroscience is more interesting than molecular stuff","It's very difficult and the teaching staff expects a lot of you, so don't have high expectations going into the class. It's not fun unless you're genuinely interested in the subject matter, although Florian and the TFs are great people and are pretty laid back and care about your learning.","This is such a cool class. Go to the first lecture and see what you think. I shopped the first lecture as a sophomore and thought I'd never take it, but I shopped the second lecture this year and had to take it even though it didn't fit in my schedule. If you enjoy learning about the brain, definitely consider taking the class. It's not that hard of a class if you just go to lectures and take diligent notes and do the assigned reading. And Eva is an amazing TF!","Class is so interesting and I loved lecture. Totally doable amount of work.","I don't think this should be a requirement for neurobiology, I think it should be an option. Unfortunately Ryan Draft's class in the fall was during most varsity sports practices so I wasn't able to take that but I think that is a better option.","MCB 105 is one of the coolest neuroscience classes out there, I would venture to say. You get a broad sample of some of the coolest calculations that the brain can do--that is, of all those we understand. The way bees navigate through tunnels, how owls tell the direction that a sound comes from, how the weakly electric fish can move away another fish to avoid a beat frequency. You also learn some big concepts about the brain. For example, though we normally think of the brain as an input-output machine, taking in the world around us and then spitting out some behavior, this is actually not the case, and this class will give you specific examples to show you why. What does the brain really do? You'll have to take this course to find out!!","The material in this course is quite interesting, but it is a course where you will need to rely on yourself to do well. Go to lecture because if you miss lecture there is almost no way to catch up (no written materials to supplement lectures). Also there are weekly quizzes at the start of section that take a fair bit of preparation (my TF held \"pre-section\" which was extremely helpful but basically like a second section every week). Also this year we had a final project due THE DAY AFTER FINALS, which honestly is obnoxious and probably not allowed. I hope this changes next year, and if it doesn't someone should complain."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is a comprehensive review of major topics in neuroscience. Florian is a tremendous lecturer and the teaching staff is phenomenal. The course provides a great foundation in neuroscience and is superior to any other introductory neurobiology courses. That said, it is a very difficult course and is time-intensive, given the weekly quizzes. The semester project is also difficult but a well-outlined timeline provided by the course along with frequent TF meetings ensures a smooth, manageable experience. Despite it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficulty, I am grateful to have taken the course as it provides students with a great understanding of how behaviors are implemented by neural circuits and it provides an appreciation of how the brain operates.","Florian is an entertaining lecturer, but the contents of this course are rather dull. If you're neuro, you have to take it so get ready to read some old nature papers! Honestly, it's not a terribly difficult course, but it's also not easy.","This has been one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. It's not easy, but you will leave the class feeling that you better understand how behaviors work at a circuit level. And that's one of the reasons I decided to concentrate in neurobiology in the first place.","I thought this class was great. I learned quite a bit and felt it had a very inviting and laid back vibe. I'm not sure why this class has taken flak in the past.","Take this class! I took both MCB105 and 115 (I ended up dropping 115 on the fifth Monday), and I can tell you that I enjoyed 105 much better than 115. 115 was a lot of math, physics, and an overall very disorganized course. 105 could use some improvement in organization, but it's better than you might initially think. The quizzes are a pain, yes, but they are very fair and doable, and they make you stay on top of the material: I didn't have to spend more than 1.5 days to prepare for the final. The final project is not too bad; it's tricky to come up with an original research proposal, but the TFs are always there so you can bounce ideas off them, and they give great feedbacks. Lastly--Florian is the best! He's funny, quirky, and very understanding of the students. He's very approachable, and loves to glide into the lecture room on his rollerblades or send out prank emails to students. Take this class! ;)","Make sure to read the articles closely. Not only will this enable you to do well on the quizzes, but you will also be adept at understanding scientific methods. This will come in handy both on the final project and the final exam.","This course in my experience was overall very good. The material is engaging and the teaching staff - especially Florian and my TF Iris - was the best part of the class. They are incredibly knowledgeable, personal, and approachable. My suggestion to you is to KEEP UP WITH THE LECTURE CONTENT. It is very separated from what you cover in section, and I wish I kept up every week by going to Florian's office hours and talking about the material with him. Doing that will come back to save you for the final exam. The final project and exam are not unreasonable, but are on the difficult side.","Just go to Office Hours in advance of the quizzes and keep an open line of communication with your TF regarding the final project and you'll be fine.","Florian is very chill and cool but he DOES NOT CARE about teaching or this class. This is a cool overview class and you will be asked to memorize lots of details for quizzes and you'll be asked to reproduce experiment results that Florian did not even talk about on the final exam. But the course is good. (? )","Did not feel like I learned anything I didn't already know from previous requirements.","WORK HARD. This is not an easy class. Outline the lecture material every week, go to office hours to make sure you really understand everything. Also the quizzes require lots of detail, so read the papers very carefully and make sure you can explain them to a friend.","Listen up, Neurobiology concentrators. If you're like me, you probably are gravitating to MCB 105 because you like behavior, and this sounds much better than 115. I just want to warn you: this class is just so badly organized, the research is massively outdated, and a lot of the content is review of OEB 57 (barn owls, fish, songbirds). Even having not taken 115, I strongly urge you to consider it.","1) Record the lectures on your own\r\n2) Have Florian ask a TF do note-taking like they did this year\r\n3) Read the papers for next week the moment you are done with section\r\n4) Attend office hours before section to get a handle on paper \r\n5) Summarize paper in your own words\r\n6) Start working on the project beginning of March","You will love it if you are serious about neuro!","This was a very interesting but difficult class. The syllabus can be deceiving, the weekly quizzes are very hard and the instructors expect a very complete knowledge of each paper and concept. This is a class all neurobio concentrators should take for the concepts, while expecting lots of work.","Good lectures, great material, good readings. Sections make this the worst Neurobio class I've taken at Harvard. \r\n\r\nIf they maintain the current structure of sections with quizzes, don't take the course. You will hate your life every Monday morning, and you will feel like you've wasted your time learning the wrong parts of the reading.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend this course over Ryan Draft's.","This class is amazing.- it changed how I look at the world around me. Professor Engert is a brilliant lecturer as well. It was a tough course- the weekly quizzes were the most difficult part for me, I found the final project and final much more manageable (however, I think I was in the minority here). Take this class to better understand what we understand about the brain as a machine.","To do well on the weekly quizzes you need to read each paper at least 3 times. I would recommend taking notes on each paper and outlining every important experiment that was done, why it was done, and the main results. It's harder than it sounds. Also the final exam our year was quite hard and definitely had some questions from the papers. If you keep written notes on the papers, it'll make studying for the final a bit easier.","Personally, I found the content presented in this course to be really fascinating, and Florian is such a wonderfully unusual guy. At the same time, the quizzes were a major, major pain.","The teaching staff and not very friendly or encouraging. Did not facilitate a comfortable environment for learning","This is a fascinating class on systems neurobiology, and it teaches you how to critically read papers very well.","I would say this class was definitely more difficult than previous years from what I have heard from students. Also, the focus on the papers was very, very intense. You have to go to office hours or be working in a science lab already for some time to do well. I think there are two types of students in this class: those who are literally killing the rap game, doing science on the reg, know the difference between intracellular and extracellular recording methods, probably have done channelrhodopsin stuff, can joke about 2 photon versus electron microscopy. These kids are killers in sections and know everything. You should take this class, kid. Then, there's the ones who haven't dealt with these methods before and need more outside help to understand the papers. I am one of these kids. Office hours every weekend, takes half a day to understand the paper. I don't know how I'll do, but it's worth trying.","This class finally made me feel like a real Neurobio concentrator. The lectures can be a little boring (Florian usually spends the first 30 minutes giving his opinion on the material) but the workload is super chill.","Difficult, disorganised, hard final...","Don't take this course unless you have to for neuro req. It is a combination of MCB80 and OEB57, except much more confusing. The professor expects you to have a lot of knowledge about lab techniques, which unless you have worked in a neuro lab (I have not) you would have no idea about. DO NOT SLACK OFF ON THE WEEKLY QUIZZES- THEY ARE NOT EASY. Prepare to know all of the methodology in the research papers."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.30","workload":"2.50","difficulty":"3.90","recommendation":"3.20","enrollment":"44","response rate":"79.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 105","course_id":"3535","cat_num":"0998","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"9","4s":"12","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 105","course_id":"3535","cat_num":"0998","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"8","4s":"20","5s":"6"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 105","course_id":"3535","cat_num":"0998","1s":"1","2s":"21","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
