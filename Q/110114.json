Since starting with the group, I have hugely deepened my appreciation and understanding of a variety of composers and their musical eras.  In the College, it is a unique experience to learn both from your professor\/conductor and from your peers in a collaborative environment.  It's a real privilege.","Take this option for Collegium if you want a pass\/fail class for whatever reason. Since this counts as a course, you could take it with a difficult semester of other classes, only requiring three actual courses for one semester!","Go to rehearsals and have fun!","Collegium has defined my college experience. You will be hard-pressed to find a group of people at Harvard more committed to musical excellence, supportive of full-body health and learning, and unconditionally loving.","If you're already singing in the Collegium, there's no reason not to take it as a course to get credit for the rigorous work that you do!","Collegium has been the most rewarding experience of my college career thus far. This is an opportunity to meet some amazing people who will become great friends, join a community of other singers on campus, and all the while make some of the most beautiful music there is together. Time commitments for rehearsal are not terribly demanding and there are a ton of fun social activities throughout the year. There is also the opportunity to take on a role in helping manage the choir, which provides a ton of great experience. Audition for Holden and join Collegium!","Join the Collegium! Such a wonderful music-making group. The passion for choral music is evident in each member, the community is phenomenal, and the repertoire fantastic.","It's so much fun! Collegium is such a wonderful community.","If you're in Collegium, there's really no reason not to take it as a class!","Great opportunity to sing at a high standard. Turnover of pieces, however, may be too slow for some people. Means less sightreading practice than could be possible. You may go weeks singing the same pieces to prepare for a concert.","HRCM is a really incredible choir. This is my 4th year in the choir and I absolutely adore our repertoire and conductors. However, our repertoire is definitely very different from that of most of the a cappella groups on campus, so I highly recommend attending the preview performance at the beginning of the year or looking into some of the choir's past repertoire. I absolutely love the music we sing but fully acknowledge it is not appealing to every college undergraduate. The social aspect to this choir is really fun and I definitely feel I have a family in the other members of this choir. If you like our repertoire, you should definitely audition!!","Collegium is the best group on campus! A wonderful community, and a great musical experience. Audition in the fall!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"25","response rate":"76.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 14hfr","course_id":"11323","cat_num":"37923","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"16"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 14hfr","course_id":"11323","cat_num":"37923","1s":"7","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
