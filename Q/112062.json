at Harvard. It was even more helpful than Ec10","Only take if you have to take or plan on having a secondary in economics. This class is MUCH better than Econ 1010a.","if you are interested in economics","Good grounding in Macroecononmics.","Sooooo much better than 1010a.  Really interesting and actually applicable to the real world.","sections unnecessary, Foote is incredible","If the class is held at 9am, take Ec 1011b instead because you will never go to class.","Foote is THE man!","It is probably the best of the required economics courses.","Excellent professor, and make sure you attend lectures because they make understanding the material a lot easier.","Keep up with the textbook chapters and go to lecture.","Everyone should take this class.  Both for general knowledge about macroeconomics, but mostly to get the professor foote experience. He is absolutely amazing, and totally worth getting up for at 9am on monday, wednesday, and friday.","You need to take this class to concentrate in Economics but it's not the greatest class you'll take in the department.","Chris Foote makes 9am class reasonable.  His lectures are fun and you should make sure to go to them.","Great course, useful models,","Professor Foote is amazing.","Professor Foote makes the class much more interesting!","It is an outstanding intermediate course on macroeconomics.  The professor is one of the best that the Harvard economics dept has to offer.  And, success in the course is definitely attainable with a reasonable amount of work.","Professor Foote is the best economics professor I have ever had and is a great teacher.","If you're doing a secondary and don't like the quantitative side of ec, then skip 1010a and take 1010b, especially if Miron and Foote are still the respective Professors. Miron was the worst professor of any subject I've had here. Foote was the best ec professor and one of the best overall.","Easy class.","Professor Foote's lectures really helped to clarify the topics addressed in the textbook and, with references to current events, were very interesting.","I liked the course a lot because I thought that the professor was amazing. However, some people are not a fan of large lecture classes, and the individual focus for those who did not seek out help was not great.","This class really teaches you what you need to understand major macroeconomic events both of the past and of the present.","If Chris Foote is teaching it, you will enjoy it.","Excellent intermediate macro class. Full recommendation!!","If you're Econ, you have to bite the bullet one way or another, and compared to 1011, this is much better.","Take this course if it's offered by Foote. Tread carefully if it's someone new.","Lectures are actually pretty interesting, as Prof Foote adds interesting views on pertinent examples from the real world","Professor is amazing! Except it's too early in the morning...","prof foote is a great, funny, interesting teacher","keep up with reading; you become as interested as you let yourself be; its fun to apply the concepts to current events","Be prepared to get up early","Great way to learn more about how the economy works.","It's not that intense and though parts of it seem boring, it sets you up well to take more interesting classes in economics later.","It's much better and more well taught than 1010a with professor footnote","This course is informative and well-taught, lectures are excellent, make sure you attend.","Prof. Foote is a great professor and keeps material interesting and fun!","important material, but must be self-motivated to learn it","The lectures are what makes this class special. Professor Foote is funny, precise, and very smart.","Go to all lectures and go more often to office hours","If you are doinga secondary and If Foote is teaching it, then they should take it.","Great class that will truly teach you the basics of macroeconomic theory unlike some other intro economics classes. Professor Foote is also one of the most engaging and easy to learn from professors I have met so far and I hope he continues to teach this course!","You'll strengthen your intro background and gain some insight into more advanced Macroeconomics.","Professor Foote is amazing. You will never have enjoyed lecture as much as you will listening to him talk macro!","Professor Foote is great! I like macro anyway, but this class was so much better than Ec 10 or 1010a. Foote makes everything relevant to the real world and easy to understand, answers questions frequently and is very accessible.","The material in this course helps you analyze real-life situations around the world more closely from a thorough, economics perspective.","A good way to learn new Macroeconomic models beyond what is taught in basic economic classes like Ec 10.  Professor Foote is excellent and clear at explaining different macroconomic models, and brings in real world applications of economics into the classroom very well.","Prof. Foote's lectures, though early and hard to wake up for, are worth it.  Unfortunately they're early and hard to wake up for.","This class does a great job of teaching macroeconomic theory and then applying the concepts to real world situations.  The professor is engaging and enthusiastic and the workload is very fair.","Professor Foote is awesome, the material is straightforward, and it's not overly difficult","Go to lecture.","This class was done so well.  It's not too difficult and definitely worth getting up for 9 am class.","Probably a required or necessary course to take, but it is fairly well taught by Professor Foote.  The course was more challenging that I expected, and section was taught poorly, but overall a fairly well taught and interesting course.","I really enjoyed this class. I am not an economics concentrator nor a morning person, yet I woke up at 9 am to attend the lectures and I really learned a lot.","Reading the textbook unnecessary except as clarification of classroom concepts - though textbook is quite good.  Go to lecture if you can because verbal examples do appear on exams.  Overall, I would even recommend this course to non-concentrators because of how useful what it teaches you is.","if you want to be an econ concentrator or get a secondary field in it, the course isn't bad, but there's probably no reason to take it if not, book is pretty much self-explanatory and it would be better to take advantage of other course offerings at Harvard","If you want to learn economic intuition and are not interested in going to grad school in econ, I highly recommend this class.","Professor Foote is arrogant and not a good teacher. The class is boring and hard.","A great way to satisfy an Economics requirement, and also very fundamental and applicable knowledge to any other field of study...got a lot out of it","A great step up from intro-macro by Professor Foote","It is a fun class.","you have to take it if youre econ-- so suck it up. How to do well on this course:\r\nread teh slides, go to Prof's OH to discuss Pset. For exams, do policy experimentations and learn teh econ Models really well. All else is common sense.","I would give praises of Professor Foote. He was an excellent professor who really made the possibly boring material very interesting.","Good course if you need to take it to fill a requirement; however, the 9am start time without videotapes of the lectures is less than ideal."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It's an easy class with a fairly interesting professor.","It's a pretty manageable class with an instructor who cares about the students","Much better than 1010a. Ok for a required class.","Very good.  Most applicable class I have yet taken at Harvard.","This class does not require excessive work but you should keep up with the reading.","Prof. Foote is a baller.  This class is excellent, lecture is awesome, sections aren't very useful, but the class can be deceptively easy--the psets are way easier than the midterm\/final.","It is very interesting and will increase your understanding of national and global economies.","Great course","This is a a normal intermediate course. Not exceptional, not disappointing.","Prof. Foote is an amazing lecturer. However, the class is difficult because it has only 1 midterm and the final is worth 50% all of which is multiple choice. It can be tricky","This class is very straight-forward in terms of structure, assignments, and grading, but Professor Foote and the textbook\/lecture slides make it stand out.  It is a particularly good class for self-motivated students to teach themselves the material.","It is well-taught by foote and if you like economics you will like the course","Take for concentration and curiosity about macroeconomics","Great class if you can wake up for the early lectures.","Make sure you understand the material very well for exams, since the midterm and final are 75% of your grade and they don't give partial credit.","The material is interesting and not too difficult to understand, but there is a lot of it and learning all the topics and formulas for the final exam is challenging.","This is an extremely well taught and the exams and psets are not too bad.  All in all this is a very good course.","Professor Foote is a great professor! He is very knowledgeable and interested in the material that he teaches. Much better than 1010a.","Most of the people in this class are Econ Concentrators and thus you should be aware that they will be very enthusiastic and eager to learn the material.  If you're not, you should watch out.","It's not an amazing class but it's fairly enjoyable for a requirement. Professor lectures well.","1010b was definitely the better half of ec1010 as a whole.  it was more interesting and better taught.  while the amount of material covered is quite daunting, it is done in a way so as not to be terrifying; however, this course still requires work and struggling","Please take this course! Professor Foote will change your life!","Great class and painless.","Do the problem sets.","Great for a comprehensive and in-depth (but not overly technical) course on macroecon, especially useful in the current downturn to get a sense of what's going on.","just remember, its a requirement","Professor Foote is great, and section is a waste of time.","The course is hard but Professor Foote is the best professor I've had at Harvard.  He's very enthusiastic and is always there to help with any questions you have.","It's a great class but you have to be able to wake up early. I was not able to.","Be prepared to enjoy Prof. Foote's lectures!","go to class","Professor is fantastic.","1011b seems to offer a more challenging and rewarding alternative.","This course tells you a lot about real macroeconomics.","The sections are absolutely useless: go only to pick up your problem set, if your even that motivated.","Attending the lectures helps a lot. However, it can be learned at the end if necessary.","Stay ontop of your work! It's so easy to fall behind. Even though lectures are at 9am, try to make them because the difference between those who do\/do not attend lecture is apparent in length of time spent on psets, midterm\/exam scores, etc","It's a great class and Prof. Foote is one of the best professors I've had.","I would say Professor Foote's lectures are very entertaining, but material is kinda boring.  Also, 9AM!","To be very careful about the exams bc even if you have been going, they can screw you.","Only take it if you are an economics major.","Great professor who will teach you a lot about macroeconomics.","This is one of the best classes at Harvard. You learn so much.","Great material to know. Great professor.","To have a strong background in Ec10, keep up with the readings.","good course to learn intermediate macro--only take if interested in the subject","Very good and would tell tem to go to lecture becuase I learned most there.","Take this class if you would like to see people that copy problem sets and cheat on midterms to do substantially better than you. Take this class also if you have to because you are an ec major. Prof Foote is great though.","It's very well taught, but it is difficult","This is a great class to take to understand the basics of the really interesting\/applicable side of economics, accessible to people not doing Ec as a concentration","foote is much more engaging then miron","Have to study greatly on your own. There is hardly any practice material to help you for the midterm or final. Go to office hours.","only if you are an ec concentrator","the professor is great; he gives many real life examples to supplement textbook examples to make concepts relevant and clear.","It is great and will really help you figure out what's going on in the current economy!","make sure you have a background of ect 10","Standard intermediate macro class. Nothing too special. Professor was organized though.","It's a great course that gives you important economics theories and concepts that are readily applicable to the real world problems we see going on today.  It isn't difficult but you still learn a lot.","It is an interesting class without too difficult a workload","The material is good, but you will have to learn it all on your own because the class is too early, so you either won't go or will fall asleep while there.","The professor is great, the class less so.","Macroeconomics is both practical and interesting, I think it should be part of anyone's education.","Beware - tests are much harder than problem sets!","I actually learned about what was going on in the housing market today in a way that made it clear what the potential problems were, but not oversimplified. This was interesting and helpful.  As an economics concentrator in particular, it's nice to be able to discuss the current economy knowledgeably when people ask about it.","Good also for non-concentrators looking to understand the current economic situation and information.","Please go to lecture! You will get more out of the class - it's really fascinating. I've seen how many people go to lecture every day and how many show up for the midterm - you will be in a good minority if you go to class","It is a great class for people who wants a more in-depth conceptual understanding of economics.","one of the best professors at Harvard, extremely interesting material","If you're willing to a do a little bit of studying, it's not a big deal, but make sure you're willing to do that.","With a different professor, it could have been a very boring\/unrewarding class-- Professor Foote makes it worth it, though.","it's a solid course that teaches you a fair bit.","Foote's lectures are terrific but you will get lazy halfway through the course, stop going to lecture because it's far too early, and then the course will get difficult","tough tests especially with curve","Better than Ec10!","This course was interesting at times and I did learn a lot of new things, but if this weren't a concentration requirement I probably wouldn't have taken it.","It's a great class.  If you're doing a secondary field, this is definitely more worth taking than ec1010a.  that said, don't take both, take more focused departmental classes.","n\/a","The course is pretty good. You won't get a very in-depth understanding of intermediate macroeconomics, with not enough focus spent on the mathematical theory and not enough focus spent on the fundamental economics. But you'll come out of it with some grasp of the core concepts.","Great professor!","know the lecture slides well!","If you want to learn macroeconomics, this is the best class at Harvard to do it.","Read the book and you'll understand 50% more.","Interesting lectures, reasonable problem sets and great test format. Only take it if you can drag yourself out of be at 8:30am though.","Prof Foote doesn't know he's gay which makes for some very entertaining lectures.","1010b gave me the economic tools to continue studying economics. I felt that the organization and clarity with which Foote delivered each lecture made the material manageable. Help is given on a need-basis, so as long as you're willing to put in the time, you can do well.","9am class will be difficult, but Professor Foote is certainly worth getting up early for.","Great lectures, make sure to keep up with them.","It's great to take a class with someone so involved in our monetary system.","It's really fun, but you should go to class even if it is at 9 in the morning.","The problem sets are very representative of the exams.","If Prof. Foote is teaching this class, it will be very entertaining and will probably be one of the best 'introductory' class experiences you'll have.","It's basically a souped up version of Ec10.","Macro is interesting and somewhat useful.  Not extremely invigorating.","Applicable & interesting material\r\nWell structured\r\nGreat and engaging professor.","It's great.","The textbook is a good resource.","Great professor who teaches well and is funny too; it's worth getting up for the 9am class.","Prof Foote is incredible. He makes macroeconomics interesting to students and relevant to current real world situations. Problem sets are not too hard, but give you a better understanding. Lectures, although early, are pretty good and Foote always gives a few laughs.","Professor Foote teaches extremely well and relates the class to current economic events to make it interesting. Definitely worth your time!","Professor Foote is one of the most engaging lecturers I've had at Harvard."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["If you want to understand macroeconomics, this is a great survey course.

This class is much more enjoyable than Ec1010a, even though it meets at the ungodly hour of 9am.","interesting class.","Try to go to lecture. It really helps out to go.","Trickier than most people admit it to be","Don't just drag yourself out of bed to the lecture, but really force yourself to pay attention as well. I found the class to be misleadingly easy until I took the midterms\/final.","If you aren't an Economics or math\/science major, this is a challenging course, but it is worthwhile despite the potential hit to your GPA. Just be prepared to work harder than everyone else if necessary. I was not as thorough in my studying as I should have been.

The exams test your ability to perform on a multiple choice test, and do not reward you at all for correct methodology.","best lecture econ class I've taken so far","Try to make every lecture even though it is really hard to do so....Foote is amazing.","Ec1010b is a very well-taught course with clear slides and expectations. Exams are straight-forward with no surprises, and Aplia problem sets focus more on understanding the material than tricking students. Foote does an excellent job tying concepts back to very current events, including the financial crisis.","Not as bad as 1010a!","interesting material, fairly well taught, but no one's going to hold your hand like in ec-10","This class provides you with fundamental macroeconomic knowledge that is useful even outside the world of academics.","This class gives a good overview of Macroeconomic theory but it requires a lot of background knowledge and willingness to teach yourself material, and it doesn't go in enough depth to make it particularly interesting. If you're not a concentrator, I would not recommend taking it unless you're ready to put in the work and time to make sure you're at the same level as students who are taking multiple economics classes.","Try to keep up at least with readings, if not lectures...I didn't and it made studying for the final terrible.","they dont make you do much work which is good and bad.. its hard to do better than average because the class was very tight with just a few questions each test separating the top and bottom. foote likes to ask questions from lecture, which most people dont attend. so the only way to get an edge is to go to 9am class every day, but that doesnt even guarantee that youre above avg","Professor Foote is fantastic. He works at the Boston Federal Reserve Bank during the day, and this allows him to have a foote (sic) in reality. He is a dynamic individual and a great lecturer. His knowledge and insight come through in his presentations, which are consistently clear and well-fashioned.","Lecture at 9AM automatically means your grade is at least a third of a letter grade less. Unless, of course, you are a morning person!","It's extremely edifying and fascinating if you put in the time to go to lectures, read the textbook, and go to office hours. If you do indeed complete the above, you'll emerge with a much better understanding of economics, and it'll enlighten your worldview and your understanding of today's society.","Must go to lectures at 9 am. They are good, but getting up consistently is tough.","Try and go to section...","Foote is supposed to be a good lecturer, but at 9 a.m. you don't really care. Try to stay awake, because he will punish you on the exams with relatively obscure questions from his lectures.","One of the hardest parts is waking up for 9 am lecture.  However, if you are able to do so, you will learn a lot about what is happening in the economy and learn a lot about macroeconomics.  Professor Foote is a great lecture and does his very best to make lectures as exciting as possible.","Multiple choice might kill you. The curve is horrible. But Prof Foote is amazing.","If you are going for an ec secondary and are choosing between this and 1010a. Absolutely take this class.  100 times better even though it is at 9.","Make sure you attend lecture. It's early but vital to your experiences in class.","Much better than Ec10. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in politics, social issues, economics, business, etc. The course deals with a lot of relevant topics and current events.","I would say that the multiple choice format makes it more profitable to go over old exams, and sometimes to know how to solve a problem rather than why. I would encourage students to attend lecture in order to do well.","Workload is incredibly light.","macro is kinda boring","only take if you like econ","This class was perhaps the most enjoyable economics class that I've taken here at Harvard. Professor Foote explains things clearly and in a way that makes you very excited to learn about even the driest of economic concepts.","much better than 1010a","Interesting professor. Lecture is very good and informative.","Solid class to learn about macro economics, good professor, much better than 1010a. Don't be afraid of this class because 1010a was lousy.","It's a great course if you can get up early enough.","Go to lectures","This course is difficult but applicable to concepts in the news today. If taking 1010 for a secondary, 1010b is certainly more interesting than 1010a, although there isn't a huge difference in levels of difficulty.","The course is interesting and very applicable to daily life.","-one of the best professors ever","Make sure to go to lecture","LOVED this class!! Prof Foote was engaging and funny, course material interesting and relevant.  Take it! \r\nBut actually go to class and study- the people I never saw in class were usually the ones who looked very sad when they got their exams back.","I found the sections to be more helpful than the lectures in terms of completing the problem sets and learning for the exams, however Professor Foote still makes lecture worth going to if you can wake up early enough.","This is the best econ class I've taken at Harvard so far! Prof. Foote is an amazing lecturer, definitely worth getting up for 9 am class.","Professor Foote is great!","This is a great course. Professor Foote is engaging and has kept me awake in his lectures despite it being a 9 AM class. You will come away gaining greater appreciation for economics and more advanced theory.","Study hard for those exams, and do try to go to lectures. Foote's a great professor.","A good class that helps you understand macroeconomics better. Tough. Multiple choice exams can be a good or bad thing.","only take it if you need a no effort core (or you want to get by with an easy class as an ec major I guess)","Do the aplia problem sets immediately after lecture.","GO TO CLASS!!! it sucks waking up early for 9am class, but believe me, it'll be worth it. AND DO THE OPTIONAL PROBLEM SETS AND GO TO SECTION. if you don't do either, you will surely regret it come exam time. unfortunately, i learned the hard way. don't be like me. foote is a great lecturer and the class should be painless if you put time into it.","It's harder than 1010a.","Attend and pay attention during lecture. Yes, they're at 9 AM, but Prof. Foote's good about keeping you fairly awake, and sometimes he'll drop random facts that aren't printed on the lecture slides that'll just happen to sneak their way onto the midterms and final exams. Also, keep up with the material (e.g. review the section problem sets within a week of section) to make studying for exams easier.","Although it is a concentration requirement, it is pretty painless. The early class time is terrible but I would highly recommend going. They help you learn the material a lot better and help you know what to focus on when studying for tests. Even though he posts lecture slides you can study off for the tests, they aren't a sufficient substitute for actually going to his lecture. The best way to prepare for his tests are reviewing lecture slides\/notes and the old tests. The section problem sets and aplia problem sets are only slightly related and not worth the time it would take to go over them.","Don't take 1010b unless you're actually going to go to lecture\/section.","Foote is an excellent lecturer -- stay on top of the material, and read the textbook, it will be your best friend. There is little interaction with the student, as sections are optional.","I took Ec1010b to fulfill a Core and thought it was really fascinating and not too much work.  The lectures at the end about the financial crisis aren't structured as well as the others, but it is really interesting to find out what actually happened.","Everyone should understand the basic workings of the economy around them and this course offers that important knowledge.  This is a great course.  Professor Foote is an excellent professor.","Foote is the best guy to see at 9 am. He is so enthusiastic. It helps to go to lecture, but if you just can't make it out of bed (which is often the case), the lecture slides are really detailed.","You must like taking multiple choice tests.","Multiple choice questions make the test enjoyable and an attainable study.","Great class for an economics requirement! Even though the class is at 9am, Professor Foote makes lectures fun, interesting, informative, and definitely worth going to. The online problem sets and multiple choice tests supplement the wonderful teaching.","Regardless of whether someone is an economics concentrator or not, this course will provide students with a fundamental understanding of intermediate macroeconomic theory that is both interesting and very practical.","Lecture is useful. Section unnecessary. Baddah-bing, great class.","Way better than 1010a.  Would really recommend, Foote is great, and it is a very fair and interesting class.  And fairly easy as well.","It is a wonderful class and the first economics course that I really really enjoyed at Harvard. If you want to take any class past Ec10, this is it! The professor is amazing. The 9 am lecture time was difficult for some people, but I think it's well worth it.","Although the 9am lecture time sucks, it will really help to come to class. First, the professor explains everything clearly. Second, he's entertaining. Third, he will ask several questions on the exam that you can't answer unless you came to lectures. And the stuff won't be on the slides.","Leave yourself a lot of time to study for the final exam. It's definitely challenging.","Prof. Foote is awesome","Go to section.","It is well taught an interesting, but only for those that have an interest in macro econ.","It's the class I have enjoyed most out of the 4 economics classes I have taken so far.","be prepared to work hard and study","you will focus on understanding the key issues facing the US and world economy today. it will leave you with a pretty solid grasp of all the terms you will ever hear on the news, and you will even be able to make arguments yourself. also, this is not a very quantitative class. you don't need to know calculus or solve equations. it's all about understanding the graphs and learning the models.","Much better course than 1010a","The class is great in that it covers very relevant topics and you learn a lot throughout the semester.","9 AM lectures are KILLER. That said, you don't have to go to do well, but Foote gives a few questions on tests on things from lectures that aren't in the book and does give a mean lecture (mean in a good way). But M\/W\/F, if you try to go, 9 AM is like the apocalypse.","This course was an excellent macroeconomics class. The integration of the current fiscal situation made the course material very relevant. The class is also well taught, and Professor Foote is quite an entertaining lecturer.","the first time in my college career i regret not going to more lectures...prof foote is an excellent lecturer, makes the material very accesible.","You have to take it if you're an Econ concentrator... so.. yeah.","The lectures is entertaining and information in the course are entertaining and interesting.","Study for the midterm and final pretty hard. They're worth a lot of your grade. Go to section. Go to lecture. If you do all that, you should be fine.","Professor Foote makes it worth it! Otherwise the material gets really dull if you're not an hardcore Econ major.","Only take it if you have to, do not take it for fun.","Its better than 1010a","It's very fair and much, much better than 1010a","Study hard for your exams, since exams account for 90% of the grade.","Take advantage of office hours - Professor Foote is definitely willing to meet with students and talk about either the class, his work at the Fed, or anything really.","Great class! But be sure to  study hard for exams and don't make mistakes!","Go to Lecture even though its at 9am","Great class in general - definitely better than god awful 1010a. Foote is great, make sure you go to lectures (even if it's 9am, it will help you understand the material). This isn't a particularly hard class to do well in, but to do so, you must be on top of the material (do the psets!), and make sure you shop around for a good TF (Wayne was awesome!). Exam questions repeat themselves (same format, different numbers) so work hardest on those to prepare for the final and mid-terms!","It's a required class, so you should take it.","If you are interested in the macroeconomic happenings in the real world, this class is great in helping you understand why they happen. However, the textbook is almost superfluous since all of what you need to know is on the lecture slides.","This course gives you an awesome sweep over macroeconomics.","I really enjoyed taking this course.","go to lecture! section contributes nothing, but if you're motivated, you should work through the section psets. no partial credit is given on tests. I actually looked forward to the Aplia problem sets...but they're clearly the easiest part of the course.","Read the chapters BEFORE lecture because Foote moves at a lightning fast pace. If you aren't already very, very familiar with the material when he goes over it, you won't take anything away from lecture.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you can't wake up by 9AM, you won't get an A in the class. You can easily pull an A- just by reading and not going to lecture, but you really need lecture and section to get the A in this class.","Go to lecture- Foote does a good job and throws some things on the midterms and finals that are not covered in lecture.","Everything's on the lecture slides, but attend lecture also.","Make sure you keep up with the workload throughout the semester! Like with any other class, it can be easy to fall behind, but in this course, it is very hard to catch up because there are so many different models discussed."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Read the powerpoints!","The course was interesting, and well taught. The section formats were great, and I was a fan of the Aplia p-sets for practice. Unfortunately, the exams focussed about 25% of the time on trivia that tested how much of the stories that Prof. Foote told in lecture rather than your actual ability to solve economics problems.","This is one of the best economics class in the department. It has one of the best professors.","Professor Foote is really funny! Try not to miss lecture, though. It's at 9 am and there are no videos. Also, the lecture material does not reflect the amount of quantitative stuff on the exams, so be careful to know how to solve relevant equations as well.","The exams can be very very tricky.","Professor Foote is great. Just make sure you attend all lectures if you want to do well on the tests","1010b is much better taught than 1010a. It really makes a difference to have a professor who actually works at the Boston Fed teach a class about macroeconomics. The class is very well organized and structured and connects to the real world much more than any of my other economics classes have. 9 am lectures are tough to get up for, but Professor Foote makes it worth the while.","The class is awesome. Not hard if you keep up with the work and go to class.","Prof. Foote is an amazing professor, and what you cover in this course is incredibly interesting and applicable to the current economic situation!","this class will teach you about real world scenarios; this is a class that can be immediately applied to contemporary issues.","Professor Foote is a good lecturer! But material can be quite dry at times.","Prepare with old exams, it will be very similar.","If you dont want to do any work and pass fail an ec class take this","Go to class. Seriously. I took this course reading these as well and I just brushed off everyone's \"go to class\" comments. Needless to say I could've done much better if I did.","This course has been the best Economics course I have taken so far. Definitely take it if you are interested in Economics at all.","Absolutely amazing lecture. 9AM lecture is very helpful and Foote is incredible. Very enthusiastic and the best lecturer i've seen at Harvard. Class is manageable and tests are easy to study for from previous exams.","Great, but 9 am class sucks.","This class is wonderful! The tests can be difficult, but Professor Foote is witty, interesting, and really teaches you macroeconomics.","you actually have you to go class","This is a solid course and Foote is a great lecturer","take it only if you have to or are extremely interested in economic models. It does give insight into the current economic situation and the financial crisis","I feel dumber for having taken this class. It is easy, yes, but also impossible to get excited about. The proportion of work that is mindless busy-work is greater than you will find in even the most obnoxious Gen Ed class. If you lack the math background, the staff of 1011b will teach you the tools needed for that class. Don't miss that opportunity to miss out on 1010b.","foote is a baller. stay on top of this class - review lecture slides-things you don't understand. prepare for midterms few days in advance. study well for final do all practice exams and finals. you'll be all set. go to lecture..you don't need to in order to do well, but the whole goal of this course is for you to develop your intuition about macro economics...and that's what prof foote's lectures will help you do if you are engaged and awake...also have to go to lecture to get some questions on exams. peace dog","Course material was interesting, useful, and well taught. The course was not too difficult, although the end of the course on the financial crisis was rushed and confusing. Exams were not very difficult, but there are alot of tiny detail questions that require memorizing obscure pieces of information. Lectures are good, and sections are well run. This course is not a big time commitment.","great class, well taught; should be taken even if you're not an econ concentrator. if considering an econ secondary and debating between 1010a and 1010b, this class is much more painless and much more useful information.","First, I want to thank 1010b. At least I am able to understand WSJ\/FTimes much better than I did a semester ago (at EC10's level). Prof. Foote is pretty accessible outside class and is an expert in what he teaches. That being said, I feel the multiple-choice format of the exams is quite unfair in that it does not reward you for the correct reasoning. Sometimes you are very prepared for a topic, but only some tiny ambiguity would cause you to choose the wrong answer. Hence there is little difference between those who are 80% prepared and those who are 20% prepared.","professor is awesome, but need to know how to take multiple choice tests well","Lectures were good, online problem sets well-structured and exams were easy - overall significantly better than 1010a.","Only take this for your economics concentration requirement.","This course is a standard requirement for economics concentrators; obviously, a key piece for any student pursuing economics. After 1010b, you'll have a good foundation of general knowledge of key economic issues and theories.","GO TO LECTURES! That's the only accurate indicator of what will be on the exams. You don't really even need the book that much.","Be sure to attend lectures.","Don't let good results on your problem sets convince you that you know the content- you are expected to do exponentially more on midterms and finals. Do past midterms and finals; that is the best prep you can do.","It is necessary for an Economics concentration.","Keep on top of work in this class. It will suck when you have less than 2 weeks to the final exam and you've been blowing off all of the readings and lectures.","Foote is very lively and educational","It's a great class. Don't be afraid to ask questions at office hours, after class, by email, if you think it will help. Also, do all of the old practice exams and problem set questions online - they really help to get ready for the exams. And show up for section - there's a good chance what you discuss will show up on the final...","Great lecturer.","Work a little every week and stick with it, you will do well.","You need to go to lecture and pay attention - the problem sets won't help you learn the material, so it's much tougher to self-teach than other econ classes. But you'll walk away with great knowledge of macro.","Chris Foote is an absolutely amazing lecturer. I didn't find the any of the material particularly interesting by itself, but Professor Foote does as good a job of keeping the class engaged as any professor could. Most econ concentrators will have to take this class, so just be grateful you have a really great professor to get you through it. Going to section is helpful and exams aren't too bad, but cramming for them can be extremely overwhelming. Lecture is definitely worth going to, even though it's held at the ungodly hour of 9am.","You really have to make sure you keep up with ALL of the material or you will get lost.","The lectures are quick so it may be necessary to go over the material before the assignments.","If you're thinking about taking this class, then you're probably required to do so. So take it.","Be ready to study, this course is tough","go to office hours before the exams and you'll be fine!","If you can find it in you to get up for the 9am lectures, go to them because they are the best part of the course.","Make sure to stay on top of the reading.","This class was always worth waking up for (despite being at 9am).  I was pleasantly surprised by how great this course was; I expected a pretty straightforward macro class that would give me the tools\/knowledge to continue along the economics progression.  Instead, I got an engaging, exciting course that constantly tied each week's theories into practical policy issues and debates.  Plus Professor Foote is awesome!","Know the lecture slides-","I would not take this as an elective, just for Concentration credit.","The tests are far more difficult than the problem sets so make sure to do additional reading and studying along with the required weekly homework.","It is great if you are willing to go to lecture. Foote is great.","things are much more complicated than they seem, so it's important to link things together (e.g. link models you learn about and see how they interact).","Chris Foote is a spectacular lecturer. Go to class, it's worth it.","Great class. If you want to get a good grade, go to lecture and pay attention. This will make life a lot easier. If not, then you'll miss out on potential test questions.","Really not as interesting as it may first appear. Foote is fantastic, but the early time slot makes it really difficult to concentrate.","Intermediate econ theory classes are never gonna be that fun, but for what it was this was a good class. Not too hard. Slighly more time intensive than Ec1010a (lots of memorization) but less difficult. Teaches macro way better than Ec 10 does","This class has been a great introduction to macroeconomics. It is not overwhelming yet I have learned a lot. Chris Foote is a great lecturer, attend lectures but also take careful notes to review. Test material comes from lecture, but it is not enough to simply listen. Also make sure to check labor market Friday data for every exam.","Make sure you know the material as you go - if it isn't intuitive, make sure it becomes so (go to more office hours etc. if need be)","Economics 1010b starts off slow, but by the end you really do learn more about macroeconomics. It is a useful course even for nonconcentrators.","A requirement if you want to be an econ major - very similar to ec 10 and pretty painless","Professor Foote is an entertaining lecturer, although he does not deviate greatly from the lecture notes when speaking\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtherefore, it is possible to not attend many lectures and still be as prepared for the exams by studying purely off the lecture notes (which are very informative and easy-to-read). Aplia problem sets are a breeze, but study using the section problem sets.","The exams and the midterms are a swift kick in the pants.","great class, not too difficult, very relevant and useful overall. 1010b is much more useful than 1010a.","The final was way too hard. The class in general is not too bad though. It sucks getting up at 9am but it's worth it. Lecture's are helpful and he puts things on exams that aren't on the slides. Good luck getting up early....","This course was a great course overall. Professor Foote is a great lecturer. The only problem is that his lectures are at 9 am in the morning. That is never fun. Aplia problem sets are easy and there aren't really that many other assignments. The one thing to look out for is exams in this class. MC Exams can be tough for this class.","This class was my favorite class this semester. If you like public policy and macroeconomics, this is definitely the course to take!","Chris Foote makes macro fun","Do every practice exam, and you will be rewarded!!!!!!!!!","look at the practice exams","Great class.  Professor Foote presents the material in a fun and interesting way. Lectures are never boring.","This class is generally known as an easy one, and this is true.  However, it is only easy in that there is not a whole lot of work.  However, if you want a good grade I strongly encourage you to actually go to lecture and section to stay on top of the material.  It is very easy to check out of the class due to the limited course load and then realize you don't know anything very well the night before the midterm\/final when you are trying to cram.","Professor Foote is great. He's engaging and funny, which is helpful for a 9 AM class. Go to lectures. Exams are very fair. You get rewarded for the work you put in.","9am lectures can be a pain, but you definitely learn lots.","This is a the best macro course that I have taken yet.","I liked this class much better than 1010a. Chris Foote is awesome. 9am lectures can be tough but the class is reasonable overall. Make sure you look at the exam format of previous tests before taking your first exam.","This class is definitely a step-up from the macro part of Ec 10, but it's absolutely interesting to the see the complex mechanisms behind the simple graphs. Foote integrates the current economic crisis well into the lectures, so it's fairly informative and intriguing. Foote is one of the best lecturers I've had in Harvard so far. This is class is demanding, as the exams, especially the final exam, is fairly difficult.","You can pick up 90% of what you need to know from the lecture slides, but Foote's lectures really are great. Worth giving 9am a shot, despite the futility of it.","Very interesting class that went far beyond the tedious non-intuitive learning of Ec10","Unless you absolutely have to take this class, then there is no reason why you should take it. If you do take this class, make sure you solve past exam problems -- that is the best way you can prepare for the exam (but no one tells you this).","Class is great, but too early in the day. Exams can be quite tricky.","This course touches upon some key concepts in macro and gets really interesting near the end, however, prof, Foote definitely has an agenda of his own and the course is designed to accommodate it. There are very few courses that could replace this one, but the structure could definitely improve by making sections matter.","Go to lecture. You will do much better on the tests if you do.","Macroeconomics makes the world go 'round. It would be a mistake not to know about it.","Amazing class taught by a very well organized and enthusiastic professor that really wants you to understand the material. You will learn a lot!","You'll get more out of the class if you go to lecture, but it is possible to succeed in the class without going very often. I wish I went more often, but when my alarm went off at 8 am, I felt no incentive to roll out of bed. The problem sets are complete jokes. The exams are a little tricky, but can be crammed for in a few days. Foote is a good lecturer, but the class structure is pretty mediocre. A class to get through if you're an Ec concentrator so you can take the stuff that you're actually interested in.","sucks, but gotta take it.","This class was great. Professor Foote is a great teacher. Teaches in a way that makes it easy to understand. The format of the tests is great too.","Can't tell you how it compares with 1011b, but it was a fun course if you can wake up before 9 three times a week.","The materials that are covered in this class will be necessary background for future economic classes, so this class is very important.","Good class; interesting and informative on the real world, but not too difficult.","I loved it. Econ that was easily understood.","Solid course with a manageable workload and a great teaching staff. The problem sets are less rigorous while still being more effective than other econ classes, and the tests are less stressful as well.","Ec 1010b is a must-take: you learn huge amounts of very relevant, enlightening information that Foote constantly ties back to issues in the economy today. Take it even as an elective - it's not easy, but it's worth it. All this providing you wake up at 9am for lecture and don't slack off in going to section, of course.","I suggest going to lecture.  The exams are directly from lecture and you'll do really well in the course if you go.  Foot is a great professor and lectures are worth your time.","This class made me realize how much I did not want to be an Ec concentrator.","Go to lecture. Professor Foote is worth it.","Its a great class that will give you a good footing to understand the wider macroeconomy","Everything you learn in this class is very worthwhile, so it is worth your time to try to learn it all. Lectures are really useful in explaining everything, and if you go it will definitely minimize your study time.","Multiple choice exam format is tricky, but manageable if you study the previous materials that are provided.","Most of this course is just a review of the macro portion of ec10, so you really don't need to work too hard in it, since so much of the material is review.","Relevant and informative. Great lectures!","This is a great course. Professor Foote is a great lecturer and really cares about what he teaches. Work is very manageable.","It's not a bad class. Not really that hard. It's more about willpower than anything = making it to lecture and doing your work","Everyone should have an intermediate knowledge of economics--both micro and macro. This class would be worth taking by non-concentrators as well.","Professor Foote is incredible at explaining the material fully and clearly. He keeps our interest by relating concepts and models that are in the textbook to current events and economic news. The class on the whole is interesting, manageable, and applicable to current news.","9am lecture is no fun","Take it only if you need to as a requirement.","Prepare to work hard - multiple choice tests do not necessarily mean this is an easy course. Prof. Foote is an amazing lecturer and makes it worth getting up and coming to class at 9 AM.","Professor Foote is a really great professor and as someone who works at the Fed really knows what he is talking about. Section and the work load are not too terrible, so if you are second-guessing your decision to take Ec1011b, I would say that unless you know you will really miss the math, you won't go wrong with this class.","The next step down the required path for an easynomics degree.","I thought it was harder than 1010a.","Class is at 9 AM.  The exams are impossible.  Forget it.","Chris Foote is a great lecturer, very humorous and engaging. The subject matter is interesting, and this class is MUCH better than 1010a. The problem sets are completely useless; just do them and get them over with with minimal time and effort. Don't buy the textbook; you can access it online with the problem sets, and he doesn't text you on things that are in the textbook if he hasn't covered them in lecture.","It's a very good class if you want to cement your understanding of the material you learned in Ec10.","Professor Foote is wonderful, as is Professor Mankiw's textbook. If you want to learn macro without having to go crazy (i.e. in 1011b), this class is for you!","9AM is a killer, but this is a good course if you can drag yourself out of bed. Prof. Foote is fantastic -- enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and clearly interested in teaching well. Go to section; I didn't, and I regret it.","I would not recommend this class to students who are not economics concentrators.","Ec1010b is not too much of a time commitment, and I really enjoyed Professor Foote's style of teaching. The midterms are a little hard, but going to Office Hours and sections definitely helps.","Try to stay on top of the lectures and the material that needs to be learned. Lectures are not boring and are very useful, so try to make it to them. The course teaches you a lot of great topics, but you need to bring a positive attitude and some self-motivation to really stay on top of it.","The professor gives great lectures but they're at 9 am so you probably won't make it to many of them.  The workload is light but that just means the exams are worth a lot.  The exams are multiple choice which means you need to know all parts of a problem to get it right.  A lot of possible points but there's no partial credit.  I was not a fan of the exam format, but still really enjoyed the class, especially Foote's explanation of the financial crisis at the end of the course.  Very interesting take.","Much more interesting than 1010b. Lectures are rough at 9am but worth it if you can stay awake. Foote is a pretty interesting professor and a great lecturer.","It's a good class if you keep up with it. The 9am class time is a little tough.","It will be harder than you expect, but it is still an exciting course.","The lectures are awesome even if they're at 9 A.M. I'm not a fan of multiple choice, especially the kind that actually have multiple answers, so that the tests were tough. The curve's high, too. However, there's lots of interesting material and Professor Foote is awesome.","Go to the lectures. Yes, it is 9am and it feels like you don't really have to go, but believe me, you do. Aplia (the pset software) gives you a false sense of security and you don't realize how much skipping lectures screws you over until it is too late. Go to the lectures.","So much better and so much more useful than 1010a. If you're going to take any ec class other than ec10, go for this one","Either go to lectures or keep up with the readings.  Aplia is a joke and the tests are the same format each year, so taking pracice tests is the best way to study.","It is very important to go to lectures because you will get a feel for what will be on the test. Also, you should make sure you do the practice test because the midterms are very similar to the practice test.","It is definitely the strongest and most interesting of the foundational 4 economics classes (among the 10a\/b, 1010a\/b series).","Solid course requirement","If you are not an econ major dont take this class you dont need it. Prof foote is pretty entertaining and his experience of working at the Fed provides for a lot of real life examples.","For students interested in economics, they should take this course.  Lectures are sometimes helpful, but it's more important to understand problem sets and previous exam material.","The class gives an essential knowledge of macro that is important to have and that can interest students that are not necessarily econ concentrators."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["solid class, repetitive from ec 10 early on. Professor Foote is a good lecturer and exams are fair but somewhat difficult","Great class for economic theory but tough and competitive too.","Keep up with the reading as the course goes on, seriously.  The problem sets won't require you to do any reading, and neither will the lectures or the sections.  Read the textbook regularly or you'll end up pulling a few all-nighters before the exams.","Even though 9am lectures are rough to make, you should definitely make an effort to go. Prof. Foote is an awesome lecturer and you will do better in the class if you attend lectures.","You actually have to study really hard for the exams (go to office hours, do practice exams, look over lecture slides). I took this class as a freshman, but didn't have the work ethic \/ study habits to do well in this class, so beware of taking this class as a freshman. Foote is an amazing lecturer, but he goes really fast (he also talks fast in general). It's best to have read the chapter before class (though you really don't need to take notes from the book or during class, just look through the lecture slides before the exams). I learned so much this semester. This class really pushed me to work hard. Also, take advantage of being able to go to any section you want and shop around for a good TF (hint: Jason Beeler is amazing. I once asked him to tell me everything he knew about the Solow model and didn't get a single question wrong about it on the midterm). Finally, go to Foote's office hours!!","Interesting material, great and organized lecturer, good textbook.","Prereq. No need to take it for any reason if you don't have to","9 AM classes are the biggest factor - you will be able to do well on midterms and finals without them but ONLY if you do lots of practice questions and keep up with notes and readings. Sections are hit or miss depending on the quality of the TF. Otherwise, Professor Foote is a great Professor and is very engaging for 9 AM, given the subject.","It is not much work but the exams are fairly difficult. The tests are all multiple choice, but can get confusing.","Go to lecture and look at the lecture slides.","It's really not a very difficult class. You can get by with just cramming before the midterms.","Good for the intuition behind major macro concepts. Foote is a great lecturer. Only thing to be wary of is the 9am timing.","Great, pretty easy class. Foote is awesome, going to lectures is definitely optional (reading his lecture slides and the book are definitely enough, though Foote is a good enough lecturer to make it worth your while to go), and the connection to the real world is pretty interesting.","It's a really good class and the topics are very interesting. Foote has restored my faith in economics even though there's still a ton of (subtle) pro-unregulated free market propaganda. Aside from the psets, the assessments don't so much demonstrate your comprehension of the material as much as they just screw you over but if you're taking the course you are likely a concentrator and should already be used to that by now.","Go to lecture, even if it is a nine in the morning! Prof. Foote is a clear, organized speaker who makes the concepts click, and he'll often cover one or two ideas that don't show up anywhere else -- in the textbook, notes, or otherwise. I would suggest being careful about choosing your section leader. The teaching quality varies, so you'll be much better off with a TF who explains things well and hands out typed pset answers in section. The exam questions are tricky; make sure you have done the practice questions well ahead of the test dates, so that you can ask your TF or the professor for clarifications.","In order to succeed, you have to be highly self-motivated to go to classes and learn the material as it comes. Infrequent assessments are challenging and you don't have too many chances to do well.","Course is super well organized, and lectures are interesting. Compared to 1010a, there is a lot less work, but as a result you also learn less.","It was a good class, but don't expect an amazing class.  Foote is an awesome teacher, but beyond that the class is just another economics course.","Very little work compared to 1010a.  Set up a lot more like a Gov class than an Ec class (very little math and economic intuition involved).  The David Johnson-Greg Mankiw \"synthesis method\" of learning from Ec10 is dropped in favor of much more rote memorization, which is unfortunate.  Most importantly, your success in this class depends upon your ability to take multiple choice tests better than the rest of the class.  This last point is the worst aspect of the class, since it does not routinely measure your ability to apply the theory to real-world problems.  Overall, pretty standard Ec class with a good lecturer.","Well-run class with a relatively good lecturer--however, often emphasizes models and equations at the cost of improving intuition broadly. I don't discourage taking it, but it will serve you better or worse, depending on your goals.","Lectures at 9 am are tough and tedious, but the material can be interesting.  Like every other econ course, there is a big curve","Do the course readings","This class is very boring and its at 9 am Monday, Wednesday Friday. I had friends who didn't go to lecture and were doing better than me in the class. I can't say I learned that much from the class either. Unless you have to take this class for Econ Major, I wouldn't take it.","The lectures are excellent, if you can get up at 9 am MWF for them. The graded problem sets are a piece of cake and are about as nutritious - if you really want to understand the material\/prepare for the exams, you  need to do the (optional) problem sets. Unlike most people, I took the class as a total elective in order to get more of an understanding of macroeconomics (I'm majoring in government). It definitely did not revolutionize my level of macroeconomic understanding from Ec 10, but it did formalize it, add to it a bit, and help strengthen it.","If you put in the work it will be a very rewarding course.","Professor Foote is a wonderful lecturer, unlike 1010a professors. The material is very interesting. The tests are pretty fair and the problem sets are incredibly easy.","The course was really good.  There's a lot to be learned and Professor Foote is a very engaging lecturer with tons of real world experience and stories.","I like this course a lot. If you take it, make sure to go to the lectures - you don't have to go to lectures to get an A, but they definitely worth going.","I enjoyed this class mainly because of Professor Foote. He is very enthusiastic about the subject and a great lecturer.","It's what you would expect from an economics course at Harvard","It's definitely a LOT better than Ec 1010a, even though the multiple-choice tests can be surprisingly difficult. Make sure you spend time and keep up with the content and really try to understand the topics before you take the tests. It was hard to self-motivate to get to the 9am lectures, but it is worth it if you can make it -- Foote is a great lecturer.","It is much better than 1010a, but still mostly a repeat of the second half of Economics 10.","Good class. Do your best to go to most\/all of the lectures, mainly because Prof. Foote is a great lecturer, but also because the exams specifically test material that is only discussed in lecture.","Do well on exams!","It's a concentration requirement; you don't really have an option as to whether or not to take it if you're doing Econ. If you are going to take it, *attend lecture and section*. I did not do so, but doing so would have helped drastically. I know it's 9am, but make yourself get up for it. If you don't fall behind, I don't think it would be that difficult of a course.","Economics 1010b is actually a pretty fun and engaging class (especially in comparison to the absolutely dreadful 1010a). Foote is a great professor and manages to make all of his material interesting--mitigating the fact that this class takes place at 9 in the morning. The problem sets are deceptively easy, and while the exams themselves are not overly difficult, they can be kind of tricky. Also, section can be kind of a drag depending on who your leader is, but that's the case in most economics courses.","Absolutely go to lecture. If you can't wake up at 9am, don't take this class.","Professor Foote is great. He works at the Fed, so it's a pretty unique experience to learn the material from him. The content of the course is super relevant and super interesting. The assignments are painless. Totally worth it. Take it.","Professor Foote does a great job at explaining the material but exams are pretty hit or miss with only mult. choice problems and no partial credit","This class was very interesting. Professor Foote is great! If you are an economics secondary, take EC1010b instead of 1010a!!! Pay close attention to the powerpoints and section problem sets.","don't underestimate the course! attend all lectures if you can","Definitely a course worth taking, especially for those wishing to continue with Macro-economics, as well as for the section on financial materials, which Prof. Foote renders in a most approachable manner.","The exams are far more difficult than the material on the weekly problem sets or in the book. Definitely do the section problem sets - they are much more helpful than the weekly Aplia.","I mean you have to take it, but its really hard and meets super early in the morning","Pretty light workload and quite accessible. Chris Foote is fantastic","This is a good course. Foote does a great job of incorporating his work at the Fed and current events into lessons.","GO TO LECTURE. Downloading the lecture slides is not enough because Professor Foote includes many examples and explanations that are extremely helpful that aren't on the lecture slides.","Foote's tests are incredibly frustrating. Multiple choice with little differentiation in answers, multiple parts you need to get correct for a point, etc.","Interesting lectures (if you get up for 9am class), Foote makes the class relevant to current events in the economics sphere","It's a great class!","Very interesting and challenging. Way too much material to cover for the final.","This course requires you to keep up with all required assignments. The problem sets, which are submitted weekly are not actually as indicative of how exams will be as they might originally seem. For this reason, I would definitely recommend that you go back through all of the section problem sets and take the time to understand how the solutions are achieved. Also, be sure to take advantage of the help from your teaching fellows and Professor Foote, who is more than helpful. The information is useful and the course is well-taught.","If you're interested in continuing your economics education past ec10, this is a really great way to do it. Professor Foote is fantastic, and even makes waking up for 9am lecture worth it. You'll learn a lot without too much work, and the material's really interesting.","Ever wondered what IS-LM means? Then take Ec 1010b! I'm not a concentrator, but I find that the concepts you learn in this class are readily applicable to current macroeconomic debates.","The only reason this class does not suck is that the professor is hilarious and great at explaining concepts that are actually not a good models for looking at the economy of engaging with the world. Nonetheless, its foundational work for future studies in economics and its well taught. The 9am aspect of this class is horrible though.","This class is amazing.  It's terrible that its at 9am but you should just suck it up and take it.  Wayyyy better than 1010a so if you are just getting a secondary please take this.  Foote is an amazing lecturer","Course content is interesting and relevant.","Ec 1010b is a great class! Professor Foote is a great lecturer and clearly enjoys his job as teacher. As someone who's not an Econ concentrator and was looking to improve my command of econ and better understand the financial crisis, this class was a perfect fit.","This course was amazing. Professor Foote is a terrific lecturer, the material is fascinating (it goes into so much more depth than Ec10 does), and it helps you really understand macroeconomics at a much more advanced level. Take it!","Even though the lectures are early, they are worth going to. Professor Foote is a great lecturer. I felt the exams required you to memorize a lot of random facts. The class isn't too difficult.","This is a good intermediate econ class with a lot of interesting material.  However, its easy to disengage and skip lecture and section.  Go in knowing your tendencies as a student and try to avoid this.","Be sure to go to lectures. Professor Foote shares a lot of his personal work experience and talks about current events that are interesting to listen to. Also, some of this information shows up on exams.","You should have a good reason to take this class. It is a lot of material, and you learn a lot during the semester.","Go to class. It sucks, but you should do it. It will make all the difference in the world.","its a great class, lots to learn. lectures aren't really necessary though--all you need is the book & practice tests!","Interesting lectures. 9 am is hard to go to, though.","This class is awesome! It really made me want to concentrate in Economics. The course load is not heavy but at the same time you learn so much. The professor is awesome.","Great course: Ec 1010b offers a very clean and intuitive introduction to macroeconomic models.","It is a good class that will provide you with a lot of tools to be successful.","The tests are incredibly tricky, make sure you keep up with the readings because the lecture slides are not enough. Also set aside enough time so that you aren't rushing through the psets to make the sunday night due date because if you go through and understand the pset instead of ctr+f ing through the readings you will get more out of it. 9am lecture is really tough","The problem sets were very manageable and the lectures were great, at least the ones that I could make it to. Great overview of Macro","This is a very good class that organizedly introduces various theories and models in macroeconomics. There also is an ample chance explore and learn about current issues.","Go to lectures. Don't skip it. All of them.","Try and stay awake in class. Lectures are amusing, but not necessary to ace the class. Read the lecture slides and the book before the test, and you'll be fine.","Its pretty good","Interesting class where you'll learn a lot of relevant information that will help you understand economics in the real world. Difficult exams, but much better than 1010a and worth it!","Despite the early hour of the lectures, it is important to attend them because they are informative and Professor Foote bases the midterm and final on the information covered in the lectures. A good class overall and an important introduction to more advanced concepts in macroeconomics.","Make sure you get a good TF","-Interesting course - exposes you to some of the important workings of the economy through a good lecturer who cares about his students. - harder than you think, though.\r\n-Go to section\r\n-Insist on smaller sections and better TFs; you're paying way too much for the poor quality of Spring 2012.\r\n-Study hard using previous exams.","This class definitely teaches information that is useful for life. It's not as easy as you think, though. Go to lecture, do the readings, and study for the tests!","Professor Foote is a great lecturer, try to attend class as often as you can. Problem sets are fairly painless, but exams are a bit trickier. Overall a pretty good course.","This class was better taught than EC1010a. Although people complain about the 9am lectures, they seem in general more satisfied with the class than 1010a. Make sure you don't fall behind in the readings or else lecture would not be too helpful. It is not necessary to read the entire textbook chapter thoroughly to get a perfect score on the Aplia problem sets.","P-sets are a joke. Foote is awesome but 9am is just not happening. Take it if you learned ec in high school and want to understand how the crisis is unfolding. And obvs take it if its a concentration requirement. Midterms harder than you think.","Fairly straight up course - Professor Foote is great!","Definitely take this class! While there are horror stories about Ec 1010a, this class is nothing like it and was definitely worthwhile. I enjoyed it and felt as if I learned a lot- the end of the course also gives a lot of intriguing insight into the recent financial crisis.","Professor Foote is a great lecturer. It is important to do the old exams and make sure you can do all the problems.","This class is well taught and a good introduction to macroeconomics. Definitely one of the better economic courses offered at Harvard. If choosing between Ec 1010a and Ec 1010b, take Ec 1010b - it is SO much better.","Create a sheet for yourself to try to understand the assumptions made in the models presented.  It will be very useful for the midterms and the final.","Do the readings, do the psets, and go to lectures. It's too easy to fall behind this course, when in reality it isn't too difficult to handle if you're timely and on top of your work.","it gets you in touch with an economic perspective of how the world works","Great course, Chris Foote is SO FUNNY, CHARMING, and YOU'LL LOVE HIM by the end of the class. Bad thing is that it's 9 A.M. :( And try your hardest to get JASON as your TF!!! He's the best, love him too.","The material in this class was really useful to know. I would strongly recommend this class for the sake of learning the material. The workload was quite small outside of studying for the exams, which were really difficult.","This class is a great introduction to macroeconomics, the lectures are great, problem sets are easy but that also means that ability to do the psets is not a good indicator of how prepared you are for the exams.","Cool class.","It is a good course, comfortably designed (except for the 9 AM lectures), with super helpful and self-explanatory lecture slides, and rather interesting material. The exams are bit tough and one really has to study for it. The best thing to do is to go through absolutely all the previous exams posted on the website: that guarantees a much better score.","Foote's great, section sucks, probably gonna get the same grade you got in Ec10","Macro is enjoyable.  I would make sure you are taking the class for the right reasons because many people complain about it a lot.  For doing well on the tests, do practice tests, look over the lecture notes, and make sure you can differentiate between the different models.","This is a good class to get a better, intuitive understanding of Macroeconomics, and does not have a large time commitment.","A fun way to learn economics. Changes the way one looks at the economy and the recession.","This course is much more lively compared to Ec1010a, and the lectures go by pretty quickly. The problem sets are really easy, but don't be fooled, the midterm and final tests are hard!! another warning, class is at 9am","Foote is a great lecturer. Content is extremely valuable. Definitely worth your time to go to lecture. Section is also really helpful. Go to Justin Beeler's section.","You have to take it if you're an Ec major. Professor Foote is great, exams are fair, but section wasn't really great. Expect pretty easy homeworks through Aplia, moderate midterms and a 3-hour final. The professor was really great though, and he made 9am lectures tolerable...","The profesor is awesome! You need to engage with the material early on or else it piles up rather quickly. Also, a final worth 50% of your garde is not for the faint of heart.","With Mankiw's textbook, no matter how bright and fun Prof. Foote might be, this is insdisputably a BAD course. The book does not prepare you for the very hard final that includes meticulous economic reasoning. Even the course itself is not designed to provide you with those skills to ace the final.","Come to classes.","Prof. Foote is a great lecturer, so if you can manage to wake up for it, go. 9AM is brutal though","The class doesn't demand that you do much work weekly so it is easy to become very lax with yourself and to not study until very shortly before midterms. That is what I did and I screwed myself over.","Great way to learn about macroeconomics.  Don't be scared away if you didn't enjoy it in Ec10.  The lectures are interesting and fun, although they occasionally repeat what's already in the textbook.  The homework isn't time-consuming, but the midterms and finals are difficult.","Even if you attend all lectures, all sections, do all of the required work, you might do badly on the test because the homework does not reflect the difficulty of the test questions. The homework is very easy, while test questions are things that haven't been practiced. Often, one test question relates to 5 others, so chances are, if you don't know one question, you're getting all 5 of them wrong as well. Also, don't expect your TFs and section to be of much help.","This course was better than I was expecting; Professor Foote keeps the lectures interesting by focusing on pertinent and interesting topics rather than solely those that are laid out in the text.  Still, it being a large, required Ec class, it is in no way revelatory.  Also, having taken the AP course junior year instead of Ec10, I felt seriously overwhelmed, and I know that many of my peers who were in the same position felt the same way, so be wary of taking this class if your previous education in economics has faded in any way.","Overall a great class. The 9am time slot can sometimes be a problem, particularly for a great majority of Harvard students who are night owls. Exams can be tricky, sections are not really helpful, but the important thing is to always go to lecture!","there should be more than two levels to intermediate microeconomics, section should be taught to students, not AT students","Everything is a joke until the exams. Those you have to study for. They can be pretty tricky.","It was fine, not too tough.  I wish I put more time into it.","9 am sucks. Foote is a great lecturer though.","This class gives solid information about the many models and theories used in our economy today.","This course is taught much better than 1010a. The lectures are engaging and the material is fascinating. However, make sure you know how to study for the tests because the questions can be extremely tricky.","The tests are a bit nit-picky, but once you truly understand the material (if you reach that point), it's a ton of fun.","Econ 1010b is a great class because at the end of it, you'll be able to think critically about any macroeconomic situation occurring in the world at any time. It just makes you better as a person. Definitely take it. The exams might look hard, but with repetition and practice, you'll be ready to do very well on any of them. Take the course.","The course is at 9 am and not videotaped.  Yikes.  Plus, lectures are generally boring, and the material is overall bland.  That said, Chris Foote is a nice guy and tries hard.  The TFs are generally good and have good office hours.  For an economics course, this gets a 5\/5.  For a regular course, it gets a 2\/5.  That's just econ pedagogy here.","Professor Foote is fantastic. He will teach you a lot about economics that goes beyond the book. However, be ready to be super attentive in lectures. Tip- print lecture slides.","Exams count for the majority of your grade in this class, so be sure to spend plenty of time studying. The best way to study is to review old exams because many of the problems are similar.","Doing and reviewing section problems and past exams will be very helpful for preparing for the exams.","If you're not an econ major, don't bother. Ec10 is enough foundational knowledge for non-majors.","Christopher Foote is a great prof. He is interesting and knows what to focus on without dwelling on unimportant stuff. Problem sets are a joke because it takes your highest score of 3 tries. Section, then, become super important but they are totally a hit or miss. I had to adjust from a horrible TF to a great one so be prepared to switch if needed. Exams are doable just make sure you do the old exams because they are directly used in the current exams.","Professor Foote was an awesome professor. He is down to earth, funny, and explains things in a very intuitive manner. 9 AM lectures are kind of rough, but worth it. I learned a lot and am extremely happy that I took this course.","I felt this course was pretty tough but it's a fascinating subject and the professor and TF's were great. On top of that, you get access to some really cool publications from the Fed which I found really interesting.","This is a pretty easy class. It basically doesn't use any math so if you're interested in doing more economics research\/going to grad school, take Ec1011b instead. It's also a minimum workload. Professor Foote is a good lecturer and really cares about making students understand the material.","It's a good class, but most of all; \"so much time for activities!\". \r\nFoote is a great, and funny, lecturer and the topics covered are interesting. However, it's extremely basic and if you have learned any math since elementary school, strongly consider 1011b.","Exams might be tricky, prepare well.","do your reading and go to lecture","It's much better than ec 10 and ec1010a, the Prof Foote is fantastic! Make sure you do each chapter of reading, go to lecture, and pay attention to the section problem sets. Aplia problem sets are really easy and kind of fun.","Go to lecture!!! That was my mistake this semester, and I sincerely wished I could go back in time, even though it's at 9AM. Professor Foote is probably one of the greatest lecturers at Harvard, so definitely enjoy it. Exams can be tricky with the linked questions (if you get one wrong, you get a whole chain wrong), but it's a fair course.","Not bad. The tests are hard, but the section problem sets are useful in preparing for them. Don't let the ease of the online problem sets give you a false sense of security.","1010b with Foote is a good, solid economics class. Lectures are pretty interesting (Foote's funny in a cool way)and he cares about getting the material across to the students. SUCH an improvement compared to 1010a. Piece of advice: READ THE LECTURE NOTES. Study the lecture notes for exams. They're thorough and  remarkably helpful--everything you need to know is in them (besides a few readings and Labor Market Friday memos).","It was interesting, but more difficult than expected.  It was very different in structure than 1010b.","It's far more interesting than EC10 (and probably a bit easier too, or at least it has less work). I wish I had just skipped Ec 10 and taken this instead.","Take ec10 and ec1010a first.","Go to lecture.","This class is not easy or extraordinarily interesting if you aren't into economics unlike Ec 10.","It is a very good intermediate macroeconomic course. Professor Foote is a very dynamic professor. Lectures are at 9 am and you will think while reading this that you will be able to consistently attend those lectures but because of dynamic consistency, pun intended, you will continue to snooze away... But in all seriousness, even though the lecture slides don't deviate from lectures, definitely be to sure attend the lectures and read the textbook to do well in this course.","Make sure you keep up with the material regularly or else your grade will suffer.  It seems like common sense but missing a few 9 AM lectures here and there can definitely add up.","Professor Foote is very nice and engaging but it is SO HARD to stay awake throughout class so prepared to sleep through classes sometimes...","This class is really hard, even though exams are multiple choice they are still extremely difficult if you are looking for an easy class this is NOT it take another class.","Exams require thorough knowledge of course material. Attend lectures (I know the 9am time sucks) and read lecture slides before\/after lectures.","9am can be tough down the stretch of the semester when your other classes keep you up until 4am, but it actually pained me to miss lecture because Prof. Foote is great.  The slides are pretty thorough so you can keep up, but try to go to class.  Read the section pset articles - they tend to fall on exams. Try to get into Jason's section.  Overall, this is a great class and not too time consuming.","I thought the multiple-choice only exams were absolutely horrible. How on earth is it testing my knowledge to stack up 8 possible combinations on one multiple choice option? I personally think 1010a is much better even if it takes more of an effort at the end at least you have your fate in your hands a bit more than with this hell.","Very straightforward and better-taught\/more interesting than 1010a.","study","Foote is a great lecturer, but the section aspect of the class can be a little lacking.","Foote makes this class worth taking. Good overview of macroeconomics, good explanations of concepts.","It's mandatory, but it's not that bad.","Very helpful in better understanding MAcro.","Go to lectures. They are very helpful, and the main source of exam material.","I personally regret not going to lectures although I did great on all exams; all the info you need is in the lecture notes. Foote is a great lecturer and I feel I would have gotten more out of the class if I actually attended- it is a 9am lecture though...","This class is really awesome! The prof is really engaging and knowledgable. If you want to do a class on macroeconomics, this is the one because the prof (who works at the Boston Fed) is well-versed with all the current economic developments and so you become really enlightened about the world around you. And also, go to lectures - it's more time-effective than trying to piece everything together from his lecture notes later on","If you're an econ concentrator, then take it. But, the tests are hard and it is easy to fall behind if you miss a class or a section.","This course is great! I learned a lot, and even though I am not very good at ec, I really enjoyed taking it. Professor Foote is a very engaging lecturer, and he makes having 9am section worth it. The material is also very interesting and relevant to what is going on in the world, so I highly recommend taking this class!","The Aplia problem sets are really easy and the exams are pretty straightforward. It's a good class, the only drawback is that it's at 9am. If you attend lecture, the class isn't hard at all."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is pretty difficult and fast-paced.

It's a concentration requirement so you don't really have a choice but to take it.  However, you won't regret taking it.","Foote is great!","Professor Foote's lectures are great! If you go to his lectures, you will do much better in class and learn much too!","Make sure that you are willing to commit to wake up at 9am","Ec1010b is a great intermediate economics course, contrary to some other intermediate courses. Professor Foote makes the class incredibly applicable to the real world.","This course will give you the basics on Macroeconomic models, and help you understand the differences between fiscal and monetary policy. You will hear about these policies from the lens of the Federal Reserve, because Professor Foote works in the Fed and he is an expert on that angle. Much of the course is very applicable to real-life situations; why poorer countries have lower levels of production than richer countries, why Argentina experienced great recession in the 1990s with their fixed exchange rates, why Greece is experiencing trouble; but on the other hand, a lot of it is based on Models, and concepts on a chapter-per-chapter basis. Great way to understand the Fed and the 2008 financial crisis. Professor Foote and his lectures are amazing!","Professor Foote is great, but this class is not quite as easy as the other intro\/intermediate ec classes before it. Prepare to actually study hard for exams.","Be ready to attend the 9am lectures as they are important for the exams. Section psets should also help.","Aplia is not indicative of the difficulty of the class.","This course was great! Professor Foote is fantastic - he was funny, engaging, and passionate about economics. The material was very straightforward; completing the practice exams and reviewing the section problems is the best way to prepare for the midterms and finals. The exams are all multiple choice, and most of the questions are similar to those on the exams from previous years that can be found on the course website. The material on the Great Recession at the end the class was very interesting and clearly presented.","work hard and go to lecture","Prof. Foote has the unique ability to explain difficult concepts in plain words.","Great course. I stopped going to lecture midway through, but I got a lot out of just reading the book and doing the problem sets on my own. A very relevant course. You become well-versed in economic concepts that are important for understanding current events.","This class will let you have smarter dinner table conversations with anyone!! (Which is why we come to Harvard, really)","I am happy I took this course. I believe every Harvard student should enter the world with a relatively in-depth perspective on how we all fit into the national and global economy. This class does not need any prior knowledge of economics so long as you are willing to put the work in. It fulfills the Empirical Reasoning requirement without anymore math than basic algebra, so long as you memorize the final derivations. Best of all, it is immediately applicable to your life.","exams are graded on a curve. 9 am class is essential unless you are very bright and can learn it on your own.  Lectures are pretty good.","Make sure you go to section and do the problem sets. It will make a huge difference when exams roll around. Also, Prof. Foote is a great guy - his OH are worth going to just to hear about his experiences as an economist in Iraq.","This is a great economics class at Harvard.  Macroeconomics is very applicable in the midst of these uncertain times at the Fed, and Professor Foote does a great job of explaining what is happening in the economy today.","The class is difficult and early, but Professor Foote is awesome. The best thing to do is to learn the information for assessments by looking at the book and past materials.","This course will be challenging and require you to keep up with problem sets and attend section (though it may be technically optional), but Econ 1010b will be a very rewarding experience and Professor Foote is a brilliant and engaging professor.","This course does not test your ability to learn the material, but rather your ability to manage your time.","You'll do better on exams if you attend lecture. There are some things that are only talked about in lecture, not in lecture slides.","Professor Foote is a very engaging lecturer.  Although the material is naturally more interesting than 1010a, this class is also taught infinitely better.  And, the professor adds in tidbits from his job at the Fed into every lecture, so you get a lot of practical knowledge.","Great class. Pretty easy and Foote is a good lecturer. Highly recommended for Ec concentrators and non-concentrators alike.","Make sure to attend the lectures! They're pretty insightful","Be prepared to not enjoy it.","I probably shouldn't have taken this class as a freshman.","It's relatively enjoyable and quite informative.","It's pretty much an exact repeat of Principles of Economics. Somehow Mankiw managed to make two different textbooks with the exact same material.","I wouldn't recommend it, but if you're majoring or doing a secondary in economics, it's a requirement. The exams are not fair, and the professor chooses such irrelevant information on tests, that's its disheartening.","do old exams before the tests","it's good if you really have no prior knowledge in macroeconomics.","You will have a solid understanding of macroeconomics after taking this class, but it is not exactly \"exciting.\"  It is definitely worth it to go to lecture -- Professor Foote is funny and makes an effort to present the material in an understandable, engaging manner; you won't get as much out of the class if you just read the slides online.  Also, be wary of the tests: they are not fun.  Multiple choice\/no-partial credit format that can be brutal and can feel like a poor test of your understanding of the material.  In sum, no matter what, you will learn a lot from the class, but if you want to do well, you have to pointedly study to the tests.","This is easily the dullest class I have ever taken at Harvard.  You don't move conceptually beyond introductory economics and instead develop models that may or may not apply to the real world.  Professor Foote is not as engaging as he seems at first.  The tests are just aggravating, since you need to know really subtle distinctions.","Honestly, if you aren't interested in policy, this course isn't going to be super interesting, which wil frustrate you when you are learning about AT 9 IN THE MORNING. Some parts outside of that were great though, the growth models were very logical and the material that supplmented the book about some of the economic schools of thought was very nice. But overall, if you aren't interested in learning about policy, and you have decent math, just take 1011b.","THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN 1010a. Professor Foote is great and makes the course so relevant. You must take this class! You will learn so much more than you did in Ec 10 about macroeconomics and how it connects to the world. You will come out with a better understanding of the financial crisis and other large economic events.","Professor Foote tries his best to make a 9 a.m. course as interesting as possible.","This course is brutally hard and not exciting at all.  It essentially puts more math to the ideas in Ec10 and the professor is a complete turd.  He ends midterms before time is up so he can go to work.  The chip on his shoulder could hold a gallon of guacamole.","It's a great class, and you'll learn a lot, but it's no walk in the park.","Wake up and go to class. Don't fall asleep. Go to section of the best TF's.\r\n\r\nThis and a little bit of multiple-choice luck will get you far in this course.","An unfortunate combination of difficult and dry. Hard to make yourself enjoy this class.","The class is perfect for anyone who is serious about a concentration or secondary field in economics.","Even if this isn't required for you, I think it's good information to have.","This is a great course. If you're interested in economics and\/or politics you should definitely take it.","Book is helpful for aplia and getting a better understanding of the material, but minute details or side boxes are not tested like they are in Ec 10. Prof Foote is a good lecturer, and it is important to go to lecture in my opinion, as the kids who don't usually have it reflected on the test. Go to section to as well!","Be prepared for morning lectures. Go to section where the TF is actually helpful and don't be afraid to meet with Professor Foote. He is definitely the most helpful.","This class, though not easy, is pretty straightforward in terms of work. Since aplia problem sets can be done three times for best scores, you're really being assessed primarily through the midterms and final, which are important (so there is not much individual problem solving in the class other than through the aplia assignments). Practice midterms and finals are great preparation for these, since the format and style of questions are very similar.","The course is good and Foote is a great lecturer but you just have to make sure you keep up with the material on your own because the aplia assigments are quite easy and not reflective of the difficulty of the exams.","Go to lecture and you will do fine","It makes a difference if you go to class and also try to not fall behind. Do the psets because those help too.","Go to lecture; get a good TF","This class is awesome. Aplia is a really great way to learn the concepts and forces you to read the book. Also, you leave the class very much more aware of how the macroeconomy and financial system works.","Foote is a fascinating lecturer; however, the exams are very different than anything covered previously.","Formatted differently from other Harvard courses: online Psets and multiple choice tests","A fantastic class. It gives you valuable insights into what monetary and fiscal policymakers are thinking, and a solid foundation for better understanding economics-related current affairs. Professor Foote uses a lot of examples from both domestic and international policy arenas, and gives a really great overview of the financial crisis in U.S. \r\n\r\nNot a lot of stress, and great learning experience.","materials and lectures are great and interesting, but the class being at 9am might make you hate the class from time to time.","Take this class if you have taken Ec 10 before and have a strong background in economics. Also, be ready to wake up before 9am three times a week, it's not easy at all! Read the coursebook, and definitely go to sections. They are very useful!!!","Ec 1010b is a great course just don't get fooled into thinking the exams will  be easy since the problem set are.","Be sure to keep up with the materials so you don't have to cram before the tests. Also, 9 am class is difficult but worth going to just to keep up with the material.","Great introduction to macro. Professor Foote is funny and very good at explaining each chapter at lecture, making 9am class not bad at all. Aplia problem sets take very little time, optional section and section problem sets (that I highly recommend). Overall an enjoyable course where you learn a lot!","This course did exactly what I was hoping it would: provide me with a basic understanding of macroeconomic concepts. I took this course concurrently with Stat 123 (Applied Quant Finance on Wall St) and a Social Studies tutorial on the financial crisis, and I found that I was able to get a lot more out of these courses with the knowledge that 1010b provided.","The tests are hard, but Professor Foote is assessable. If you don't udnerstand something, go and seek help right away because it will come back to get you on the exam. The 9 AM classes are annoying sometimes but deal with them and go to lecture.","I like macro ec, so this class was great for that. Prof foot is awesome, and section can be helpful. Aplia assignments are actually helpful, and tests aren't too bad. Very straightforward, informative course","9AM lecture and video not available online","Professor Foote is an amazing teacher!  9 am class is hard to get up for, but it is totally worth it.  (Plus, there are still 15 minutes of hot breakfast left at Annenberg after class!)  His lecture style is logical and makes the material relatable and easy to understand.  This is a good course to take (even if you have no prior economics background, like me) if you would like a better understanding of the underpinnings of and trends within our economic system.","This is a much more interesting class than 1010a. Don't let your experience there influence your decision to take it.","Try to go to class and do the readings","This class is very interesting, but sometimes focused too much on memorization\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif you pay attention in lecture (and go to 9am lecture!), you'll do fine.","Although this class is not a repeat of Ec10, a major part of the materials are not new. Slides are good.","Interesting material that will teach you a lot about macroeconomics.  Foote is a good lecturer and accessible.  Stay on top of the readings, go to lecture and section.  The problem sets are easy but you will struggle on the midterms\/ finals if you don't keep up.","Great way to learn the basics of economics, quite interesting","Study the lecture slides. I'm still uncertain as to how important reading the book is for success in this course.","This class goes over many interesting and relevant topics in macroeconomics. You will better understand what's going on in the current economic situation after taking this class.","Great macro class, Foote is a great professor","It is difficult. Be careful, go to lectures.","Very Boring. Only take it if you need it for a requirement.","Much better than econ 10, though Im sure it is difficult to make it to 9am class for non athletes. But I really feel I learned a lot and can engage with current economic problems.","Coming after Econ 10 and 1010a, Econ 1010b is much better taught and more interesting (Unlike Miron, Foote is an engaging lecturer and uses good slides, and unlike Ec 10, actually teaches the class). However, making it to 9 am lecture can be a huge struggle, and its possible to do well in the class without going to lecture or section. It ends up being a pretty low time commitment per week.","This class is one of the most well-run, interesting economics classes at Harvard. Professor Foote is a very good lecturer, and I strongly advise attending lecture every class (though it's at 9:00 am), as well as section. The weekly problem sets are extremely straightforward, and the section problem sets provide more challenging material that is comparable to the concepts tested on the exams. Read the chapter before attending lecture and section, and you will understand all the material; nothing in the class is too difficult to understand. Professor Foote is a really nice guy; get to know him at office hours and\/or faculty dinners. Albert is an EXTREMELY good TF, and did an incredible job reviewing and explaining concepts. Finally, while the exams can be tricky, it is very easy to do well if you've read the book, attended lecture and section, and done all of the past exams. Overall, a very solid class that provides relevant information on the macroeconomy and financial crisis.","Not an easy course. GO TO LECTURE. It's 9am three times a week which is demonic, but you'll miss so much if you don't go. Trust me.","This was my favorite economics pre-requisite. Professor Foote is fantastic and makes the 9am time slot worthwhile. You should be sure to come to class everyday and I guarantee you will learn something valuable.","Ec 1010b is definitely preferable to 1010a. The only downside of this course is that it is at 9 am. Other than that, Professor Foote is great and it is a course with a fairly low workload. The topics covered in this course are very important for understanding current economic policy.","Excellent course except for the sections - foote is great and does a great job explaining the material.  The applia problem sets help you to learn the chapters and the exams while challenging are all multiple choice and very fair.  A must take to understand macro-economic policy and much better than Ec-10.  Take instead of Ec-10 if you can.","Go to every class! Professor Foote is a great lecturer! Your level of understanding of the world would increase exponentially after taking this course! Take it!","Really good class.  Although the lectures are at 9am, they are very worth attending -- Prof. Foote is a great lecturer.  You will come out with a really solid understanding of macroeconomics.","This class is awesome! I really loved the material covered (why is Africa poor, what started the financial crisis, what is the current strategy for the Fed, etc).  Assignments were quick and tests were fair yet challenging.","If you aren't prepared to go to lecture, don't take it or at least set aside time to watch lecture videos\/read lecture slides each week.","READ THE TEXTBOOK ON TIME, DO THE SECTION PSETS","This class is awesome and drastically improves your knowledge of macroeconomics. This class really solidified my interest in Economics and really made me enthusiastic about my concentration. Highly recommended for everybody.","I liked this class much better than the Macro portion of Ec 10. Professor Foote is a good lecturer and makes the material easier to digest. Though 9 am lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are difficult to wake up for, they are invaluable for the exams as Prof. Foote often diagrams or discusses key concepts that will be tested. Sections are not mandatory and in my experience were not worth attending, anyway. The TFs are not the most effective teachers of the material.","Foote is great, but the time is just much too early","Go to lecture. Read the book. Pay attention to aspects of lecture that are not included in the book. A decent proportion of the test will be based off of these facts. Section is very helpful. You may or may not really need to go in to get extra help though. The questions are relatively straightforward. I would say that understanding core concepts is more important than just solving questions.","Go to lectures and read the book. If you do both, this class is great.","It's difficult, but it is manageable","Only take this class if you're going to concentrate in ec. It's at 9am, so you think you'll go to lecture but won't. Section is questionable. The problem sets are really just a waste of time. Plus the tests are REAL tough.","This class is great!","The tests were absolutely ridiculous and unfair, not in that they were easy or hard but because the way points are assigned on the exam depends more on when you make a math mistake (on the midterm, it could have cost you up to 5\/29 or 15% or so)  add in the fact that the \"check all that apply\/you must get all correct to get 1 point for this question rewards strategic error-making over actual mastery of the material, particularly over 2 exams worth 20% of the grade each, neither of which were out of more than 35 points. For context, 15% on a midterm could be up to a 30% boost on the curve, or the difference between a B+\/A- and a solid A. pathetic. It's an amazing course in terms of material, and Foote is a good lecturer (considering the 9 am timeslot that's high praise), but there really is no explanation for this ridiculous exam system. improvement much needed.","Go to the optional sections...","The lectures are really good, but they're super early. That being said, the lectures reflect the book very closely (aside from the last week) so you don't actually need to go to lecture to do well. The course is pretty easy, but not as fascinating as other ec classes, so only take it if you need at as a prereq\/requirement, not on its own.","It's one of the less painful required classes in the economics department, and professor Foote is great.","Professor Foote's lectures are extremely effective and he is AMAZING at teaching. This class teaches you practical information that could potentially come in handy for internships etc. \r\nI recommend just buying the Aplia key and avoiding buying the textbook. The textbook cost me over $100 and I did not use it once this semester. Professor Foote's slides have all you need to know for exams, homework, etc.","annoying. foote is obnoxious. dont take it unless you need to","This course is another ec requirement that you have to whip out. It's better than Ec 10 and Ec 1010a, but it's definitely not without it's flaws. It's at 9 am three days a week (terrible), most of the class stops going to lecture because of that and because lectures were, sometimes, pretty boring. To study for it, try to pay attention in lecture and read the lecture slides (they are way better than the book). Also try to compile all equations and graphs in study-guide like sheets as you go to help study for exams. A lot of the exam is just knowing these basic graphs and equations.","This class is better than Ec10 or 1010a, with a great component about the recent housing crisis and recession.","the exams are all multiple choice: not the best format for a subject where the answers are debatable","Keep up with the lectures since there is some useful content in there. 9 am lecture is killer but the material is pretty straightforward. Just stay on top of it.","Ec1010b with Professor Foote is a wonderful class, and I recommend it highly! The class covers a lot of material and ends with a truly fascinating look at what caused the Great Recession \/ financial crisis of 2007-2009. Professor Foote does a great job at trying to explain difficult concepts intuitively, mixing in an endearing sense of humor as well. Always do the readings and Aplia problem sets, as well as the section questions -- they are very helpful. The multiple-choice, AP-like exam format wasn't my favorite, to be honest. But overall, this is a very helpful class that will leave you with a solid, robust grasp of macroeconomic theory!","Go to lecture; its interesting and definitely helpful.","Thought it was much better than 1010a. A little fast-paced and there is a lot of material though.","go to lecture and keep up with the material; use the past exams to guide your studying throughout the semester.","You really need to keep up with practice problems and actually do aplia properly, because its really difficult to do well on the tests if you just dont pay that much attention to aplia and get by in lecture.","Great course. Keep up during the semester. Get behind and its tough. I did that. And it was tough.","Keep up with the reading - think about the class on a chapter by chapter basis and look for connections between the chapters.","If you're looking for an intermediate macro course, be careful about this one, especially if you're the sort of person who likes to learn things in the rigorous way and hope to use math in econ. There're many people who decide to take this class simply because they didn't want to continue ec10. but then they usually regret because you won't be able to do 1011b once u take this one.","Great class, just stay on top of the readings and DO THE OPTIONAL PSETS or you will suffer come exam time","Go to lecture!","Professor Foote is great!","Take Ec 1011b if you're at all interested in Economics. Ec 1010b is oversimplified to the point of being very boring and caters only to those who want an easy degree. I really wish I had taken Ec 1011b, but it conflicted with another class of mine.","Difficult but worth it","Beware the multiple choice tests. Otherwise, a great class.","If you are an Economics concentrator you have to take this course regardless, so just grin and bear it.","Necessary class for concentration, not a fun elective","Even if you aren't an Econ concentrator, you might still want to take this class because it is fairly work-free, and you will still enjoy the material when you are study for the midterms and exam.","Go to lectures. They are interesting and cover everything you need to know for exams.","Great class, great content, brilliant professor gives great lectures. It's testament to Prof. Foote that over half the class turns up every day at 9am even though the lecture slides are all online. The content is interesting and the relevance of it all is explained. I loved this course, would recommend with enthusiasm!","Serious gem. Assignments prep you for the course material and all the past exams are at your disposal for studying. Great class. Foote is a stud.","The structure of the learning in this class (and exams) is somewhat odd. The class separates the models learned from chapter to chapter rather than synthesizing and comparing them as we usually do in most other classes. Also, the format of the exams can turn out to be challenging, but the concepts themselves are not too bad.","Be prepared to work harder in this class than in intro ec. Also allot enough time to aplia!","Lectures are good. But exams are annoying and extremely punitive.","Great course with a great professor. Try not to miss the lectures although they are at 9 am. Foote is just the best.","Do everything that is said to optional and you'll be better off than most. Prepare to be fooled on exams so make sure you have a full grasp of everything","study past exams and problems sets, and you will do well","This is the same class as Ec10 plus 1 chapter on IS-LM","Section is horrible, no point in showing up. Professor Foote is awesome but you will have to drug yourself to the sc at 9 am 3 times a week. For ec concentrator it's a rather painless class but it doesn't really facilitate a lot of learning. I would consider doing 1011b.","Foote is a great lecturer, but 9am lecture is tough to make 100% of the time. it's worth it though! the exams are very tough, you need to study the slides and old exams very very carefully and don't focus as much on the actual economic theory since there are no free response questions that measure your knowledge like that","The lectures are engaging. To me, this separated this course from Ec 10. However, it's another of Mankiw's books, so it's the same perspective. The section, however, is extremely unhelpful. They don't teach; they go over practice problems. I don't know if this was true in other sections, but in mine the TF was extremely inefficient at explaining difficult concepts or even answering students' questions. This at times was infuriating."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The online problem sets are fun and easy- you can probably do them all in the first week of classes.","This course was very great and very rewarding. Professor Foote is also such an engaging lecturer, who gives a very organized review of course material from the book. He has a great sense of humor and makes the class fun and interesting. You will come out of the course feeling like you learned so much about economics and also the world around you. Now I feel I could explain to someone what happened during the financial crisis, which is very important and beneficial!","psets - easy\r\nlectures- okay, most people skip them\r\ntests - annoyingly tricky and don't seem to be that good at testing understanding of the material\r\noverall - a fine class if you need it for some requirement, but wouldn't recommend otherwise","I loved this course. Professor Foote is fantastic and teaches the subject material in an interesting and easy-to-understand way. He connects the material to actual events, making the subject all the more fascinating and relevant. If you did not enjoy Ec 1010a--or even if you loved Ec 1010a--don't worry, you will love this course.","Study very hard for the tests","Be focused. There aren't that many assignments so it's easy to skip doing work until the exams.","Take this class if you have the slightest interest in macroeconomics, with the focus on the conceptual, rather than the mathematical, approach. You learn a lot of applicable and important economic models that open your eyes to several real world applications and situations.","This is a great way to learn econ, but only so it if you can commit to coming to lecture, since you'll learn so much more that way.","This is a really interesting course and Professor Foote is a great teacher.  The class is almost no work and the exams are relatively easy if you study.","Go to section because the section problem sets are more useful than Aplia","This class is brutal for 2 reasons. For 1, it's taught at 9 am which for me, was very difficult to get up for. Second, if you don't attend lecture or section (which is optional), then you're at a severe disadvantage for the exams, which are incredibly nitpicky and ask questions about things talked about in lecture but not in the lecture notes or reading. Overall the info is really interesting and useful, but it could definitely be a better class.","Despite its 9AM lectures, Prof. Foote is one of the best professors I've had at Harvard. The course material is difficult but engaging, and definitely stuff you should know to be a better citizen. Study for tests by doing all the practice tests provided, and don't push it off till the last minute. Go to lectures!","The content and lectures are great, but other aspects of the course lack. Make sure you find resources yourself pretty early on- a good TF or group of friends- or you will find yourself completely confused and without resources.","Great class! Definitely make an effort to attend lecture","This is a wonderful course. Professor Foote is great. Don't worry that it is at 9am, the lectures are worth it. He'll even throw in the occasional joke that is actually funny. The exams are very reasonable, and he wants you to succeed. Take this!!","This is an awesome course. It sparked my interest in macro. Professor Foote is amazing and knows his subject. Go to lecture! He tests on what he says in lecture.","9am is tough but the class is good","It's so hard. I took this class mostly as an elective just because I thought it would be valuable information and thinking that it would be on the easier side because that's what people say but it's not. I went to every lecture, went to optional section, and still didn't do well on the exams. Don't take it unless you have to.","This is a solid course. It teaches you what you need to know in a very efficient manner. Don't be put off by the 9am lecture times--you can survive the course even without attending them (though I would recommend that you go). The assignments and exams are easy. I took this as a fifth course and it worked out well.","Lecture: early, but really engaging because the professor is great\r\nSection: useful for exams and covering more difficult concepts\r\nReading: useful substitute for lecture for the most part\r\nExams: pretty formulaic and nice, though sometimes they can surprise you\r\nProblem Sets: super easy, but also helpful for concepts","This course is extremely interesting. Professor Foote is a good lecturer and very helpful at office hours. He really makes you see the importance of what you are studying.","It's pretty hard but take it if you want to concentrate in Economics.","Make sure exams don't overlap with other classes. Do the practice exams. Memorize the random facts. Try to attend lecture, even if it's early in the morning because there are random facts from lecture that pop up on the test.","This class is great. Literally the only thing I'd do differently is have it taught at a reasonable time.","This class is pretty interesting, especially relative to the other required economics classes (10a, 10b, 1010a). Professor Foote clearly cares about what he does and makes the lectures interesting for the students (9am lecture is very hard to make). The psets are extremely easy (online and basically everyone gets 95%+ on those). The class is very organized with all lecture nots online. The concepts are actually useful if you take the time to learn them. It is very easy to fall behind because lectures are very tempting to miss (9am). If you can stay on top of the material, this isn't a hard class.","Solid class, but it's at 9 AM. Take 1011b if you have the math.","Professor Foote's personal anecdotes liven up the lectures and make the material much more easy comprehend. Sections are very well organized and really push you to think deeper about concepts addressed in lectures.","Foote is an interesting lecturer and this course is important for understanding macroeconomics.","Class is relevant to real events, but much of the material on the exams about these real events is not covered in class.","Great lectures, great textbook, and great material. One of the best classes I have taken after two years. You will leave this class as a better informed citizen of the world. Professor Foote's passion for the subject is infectious. The workload is very reasonable.","I mean. It's a concentration requirement.","This was an amazing followup to Ec 10 and Ec 1010a -- the class was perfectly organized, the workload was not too heavy, the slides and lecture were very helpful, and as long as you studied the material on your own and went to section, you would do fine. Foote is great and applied everything we learned to real life matters.","Class is much more enjoyable than 1010a.","Professor Foote is the best! Try to get to know him if you can.","This course is more interesting than Ec10 and the Aplia psets are interesting and manageable. However, the exams are extremely difficult and written to trick you.","I took this class to satisfy one of my secondary requirements and thoroughly enjoyed it. Foote so far is the best Economics lecturer I've had on campus. Do be warned about 9am lectures though...","Do not take it unless you have to.","This is an awesome course if you're interested in intermediate macroeconomics","I mean.......it's required. So only take it if you need to. A lot of theory similar to Ec 10. Although the last few lectures on the Great Recession of 2008 are useful for life.","This class is not fun.  Going to lecture is not necessary at all.  The aplia can be done with the control f function and the digital textbook.  The section problem sets and recent old exams are really the only things you need to prepare for the exams, most of the questions are directly from these two things.  Also go to section.","The problems sets were easy, but the midterms and finals were entirely multiple choice; it's creatively dead, and for me punished me due to format rather than my understanding of the material. I hope this changes in the future, but the structure is understandable given the class size. Also it's at 9AM.","This class has good lectures and is generally interesting. Professor Foote is great, and after the monstrosity that is 1010a, this class will seem like heaven. Caution: This class meets three times a week at 9am. Uncaution: this is a good class, you should take it.","For an introductory economics course, this one is actually pretty great comparatively. Professor Foote is not only a good lecturer and makes an effort to keep things interesting, the Aplia p-sets are also helpful in reinforcing the material. However, be wary of the exams as they are each worth a significant portion of your overall grade and are rather difficult! You really do have to put in the effort to study if you want to do well in the course.","It's pretty interesting, and Prof Foote is great.","great class - take it","Foote is a great professor.  Very organized and on his game.","study a LOT for the midterms and final","Know all content for the exams.","Everyone, whether an Ec concentrator or not, should take this class to fully understand the world around them","If you're an economics concentrator, definitely take this class.  The professor is a great lecturer and keeps the material engaging.  Workload is not bad at all with the readings and psets taking less than 4 hours a week usually.","Exams can be very difficult even if you feel you have a good grasp of the material.","The professor is awesome and generates interest in the things he is talking about which made the class interesting.","Really important, extremely relevant class to take.","This is a great course.  Uoi learn a bunch of useful info and Professor Foote is a great lecturer that really understands how to get points across to students.","The tests are difficult even though they are multiple choice. DO the practice tests.","It is a good class, but be prepared well for it.","This class was so much better than 1010a.  Foote is a much better lecturer and class was super intersting. The grading system on the exams can be tough, but I enjoyed the class.","I like this course because it provides you with a good grasp of macroeconomics that is helpful for higher level economics courses or even for every day life. However, problem sets are not at all indicative of exams. Make sure you go to lecture, as a lot of what you need to know is explained well by Professor Foote.","As a Government concentrator, I'm very glad I took this course. You learn a great deal about monetary and fiscal policy, floating and fixed exchange rates, the IS\/LM model, international development, and more. There is no calculus involved (or that you have to follow along with), and it is a minimal time commitment. Professor Foote is an excellent and committed lecturer.\r\n\r\nOverall, you learn a ton of critically important material with no busy work.","If you can get out of Ec10 and want a great Macro course, take this one. it is totally doable with basic macro from high school. Professor Foote is great, knows his stuff, and actually does this for","If getting a secondary or concentrating in economics it is a must, other than that if passionate about economics take it, or wanting to learn about today's economy.","Not quantitative. Good for policy. Moderately difficult.","Make sure you go to class and study a ton of the old tests and work on fully understanding money supply and fiscal policy","Good class even if you are not concentrating in econ.  Good if you just want to learn about the world of economics.","Ec 1010b is an interesting overview of macroeconomics and our situation today.","Foote is a great lecturer! He is knowledgable and passionate about the topic. The assignments are not too time consuming but helpful for learning the material. The tests are also a good format.","It's a pretty enjoyable requirement.","Take it, you learn so much!! Professor Foote is amazing at lecturing and gives lots of As.","It's much better than 1010a","Even if you're not an Ec major, it's still pretty interesting to learn about the economy, especially what happened in the financial crisis. And if you're an Ec major, you'll enjoy this far more than Ec1010a. Time flies by in the 1 hr lecture.","Tests are annoying and difficult (similar to Gilbert's SLS 20 exams)","The lectures, while informative, are not very interactive. Additionally, the section component of the class is optional and doesn't count for a grade, so there is not much incentive to attend. I feel like I would have learned more if section was a bigger part of the course.","If you're considering taking this class, you probably have to.","The exams are very difficult and the class overall is not easy to do well in. Professor Foote is a good lecturer but going to section is definitely recommended because it is hard to make sense of all the material just from lecture.","Only take this class if you are actually interested in macro or plan on concentrating or getting a secondary in Ec. The material is interesting, but the exams are a pain, and they count for almost all of your grade.","Tests are really tough. This class isnt a joke.","Only take if if you absolutely have to.","Ec 1010b is a great class. Professor Foote makes 9am lectures enjoyable and the material is really interesting. I recommend taking it even if you are not an ec concentrator- you learn important concepts about the general economy that every student should know before they graduate.","Just take 1011b. The exams are all multiple choice and end up just punishing you for stupid mistakes. Professor Foote is really nice and pretty good at explaining the concepts, but that's only if you can make it to 9am lecture...on Friday mornings...","The psets were a bit annoying (in terms of when they were due) but they are helpful to keep you at the right learning place.","Interesting course. It may seem easy but be careful with the exams, they are harder then they look.","Would only recommend to concentrators or those pursuing a secondary in Economics.  If you enjoyed Ec10b, you will enjoy this class.","If you're looking for an econ class that actually seems relevant to today's news, take this. Foote is incredible and super approachable as well!","If you are an Ec concentrator who hasn't taken multivariable, like myself, you have to take this course, so you might as well enjoy it. 1010b is relatively painless and the lectures, while being at 9 AM, are engaging. Just make sure to actually go to lecture and section-- if your section leader isn't helpful you can always go to another one. I made the mistake of oversleeping through lecture and skipping section this year and this did no wonders to my grade.","Do the work and you will be fine.","Go to lecture, Prof Foote is a great lecturer and the info is interesting","This class is awesome and definitely worth your while!","do section psets","Make sure to prepare thoroughly for exams by reviewing the practice tests. Concepts are recycled from year to year, and scoring format of exams is very tough.","This is a very good class. Having taken Ec 1010a, I thought that this class would be pretty badly run as its equivalent in micro. However, the professor makes a difference, and since Foote is a very good teacher and always has interesting things to talk about, you will most likely enjoy taking this class as I did.","do the work and you will see the results","Make sure you take practice tests before the midterms\/finals! A lot of them!!","If you like mathematics more, take 1011b. If you like a lot more real-life stuff that is conceptual, take this course.","This course is a great course on macroeconomic theory with a strong application and study of real world events.","As long as you stay on top of your work, you will do fine in this course.","Chris Foote is an awesome and entertaining professor and will make the concepts more accessible and easier to learn.","This is a GREAT class. The fact that the lecture takes place at 9 am is unfortunate as some students do not attend lecture very often, but the lectures are excellent and you should definitely go. Foote is very clear, intelligent, and engaging, and he makes the material fun and also relevant. He often relates the material to the work he does in the Boston Fed, which is really cool. This class is much more interesting and exciting than 1010a. There is also very little work-  I rarely spent longer than an hour per week on this class. The low workload can be a problem, however, as it is easy to fall behind in material, and the midterms are not easy.","I could recommend this class to anyone looking to learn more about the macroeconomy. Especially the lectures on the financial system were fascinating and taught quite a bit, which anyone interested in current events and the political economy would enjoy. Wouldn't say it's the best class though...","Professor Foote is a great instructor. This class is easier than Ec10, but still very hard. You will spend a great deal of time trying to figure our a lot of things by yourself...","Much better than 1010a! Take it! Online p-sets, enough said.","Be aware, this is a very fast-paced class. Professor Foote is a great lecturer but the aplia psets are tedious and the exams (consisting of solely multiple choice questions) are very tricky and requires memorization of material that is presented in lecture but not necessarily covered in the lecture slides. Section was not very helpful, look over the psets before the exams though and make sure that you go to lecture. 9am lecture three days a week is rough but attendance is necessary if you want to make sure getting a B\/B-","Tough it out and go to lectures.  You came to Harvard for the challenge, and view getting out of bed at 8 as one.  Foote is a funny guy, and he may be the one of the best teachers I have at Harvard.  The class overall is pretty simple....still that intuitive thinking that you find in 10b, but more sophisticated models and a bit more math.  The problem sets are a breeze. Take it!","Take advantages of the TF's office hours and the abundant practice exams!","Only take if an Ec concentrator.","Very clear lecture slides \/ readings will make this class straightforward and interesting. The material is applicable to the modern world, which is always a great plus!","The class is really interesting and Professor Foote is an incredible lecturer. The workload isn't too bad. But the tests are terrible and they will be the most frustrating and stressful ones you've taken so far in econ (which is saying something-- Ec10 and Ec1010a exams were no cakewalk).","This is a good course, if economics is part of your degree plan. I would not take it for fun.","did not like the test format","Go to lecture, it will make your life a lot easier.","Really not a hard course. The rote memorization right before midterm\/finals is a bit annoying.","This class is interesting but the exams are very difficult. Try to make it to lecture and section because the section problem sets that aren't required are by far the most help in learning the material. However, be ready for the exams to be hard and annoying as they are all multiple choice and often tricky in their wording.","Prof is great and funny, exams are neither","Professor Foote is a good lecturer, but be prepared to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time, and to be left sitting in your room wondering how you'll ever know what's on the test. Test questions are also unfair and strange in that you have to check off all the right boxes to get a point...The tests are great at evaluating total mastery, but not so great if you know most of it. it's terrible if you know, say 80% of the material, but find the marginal cost too high for the last 20 hours of finetuning. Be prepared to memorize EVERYTHING if you want to feel prepared.","very little work. easy class. boring, but you can get away with not attending lecture ever (good lecture notes are posted online and the textbook is good)","If you just do the work then you will be fine.","it's necessary, not too bad, you have to take it if you're looking at this so why even worry?","It is probably the most useful class a student could take at Harvard.","Professor Foote is an excellent teacher. His lectures are engaging and very interesting. The psets are nice and easy but the material can be challenging to grasp if you don't have some background in macroeconomics.","Go to all the lectures!","There is NO partial credit on his exams which has a very high chance of tanking your exam grades. It's definitely a new exam format that I had never seen and was pretty unprepared for that in my study methods.","Points to remember (unless they change the class): No lecture videos, 9am lecture, and entirely multiple choice exams. Proceed with caution if not a morning person. But other than that, the class is decent. Not enough study aids though. Other than section problem sets and old exams (no explanations to the exams answers), there are no practice problems to work with."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"323","response rate":"73.07","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1010b","course_id":"955","cat_num":"2924","1s":"3","2s":"25","3s":"65","4s":"86","5s":"52"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1010b","course_id":"955","cat_num":"2924","1s":"6","2s":"30","3s":"108","4s":"76","5s":"11"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1010b","course_id":"955","cat_num":"2924","1s":"74","2s":"130","3s":"24","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
