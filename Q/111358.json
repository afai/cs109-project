'08":{"comments":["This course provides exposure to a variety of topic in gene expression regulation by tracking the progression of the field through historic papers."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["This will likely prove to be the best class I took at Harvard. Other students referred to it as the Fred and Bob show, I preferred to call it the comedy hour with Bob and Fred. However you choose to name it, they are fantastic educators and scientists, and if people like them educated more science students, the net increase in quality scientists being graduated would be highly significant.","The instructors make this course great."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["A great discussion course that lets you think critically and have a good time too!","I loved this class!  I am very interested in the regulation of gene expression, so I loved the papers that Fred and Bob selected.  The discussions were very comfortable and enjoyable.  Fred and Bob were great at facilitating discussion and I enjoyed their insights on the topics and on how they approach reading scientific literature.  The student presentations were a great way to discuss a few additional topics and provided excellent presentation practice.","Very interesting class- the discussions were insightful and enjoyable.  It is a lot of reading and quite a time commitment, but worth it.","You learn so much...and Fred and Bob are amazing.","Probably the best course I've taken here.  Micro230 as it should be.  The workload is a bit intimidating, but it is more than worth it.  This class teaches you how to really understand papers, and how to apply examples of success to one's own work.","This course greatly improves my critical paper reading skills. I feel more comfortable and confident in group discussion than before. I also learn a lot from fellow students. There are a lot of readings every week, but the class atmosphere is great and relaxed (it is funny to see Bob and Fred make fun of each other). It is a great joy every week.","One of the best courses I took at HMS","I would recommend taking this class, even if your field of interest\/research is not directly related to gene expression.  Each week, you read historical and newer papers on a different topic related to gene expression.  You end up learning in depth about areas of gene expression that may have been glossed over in other classes.  You also learn about the origins of research in these fundamental fields and how they have gotten where they are now.  You can also tell that Bob and Fred both care a lot about developing students as scientists, and they try to design the course so that it serves to this purpose as well.  In addition, Bob and Fred are hilarious together, and they do a really good job of making the discussion environment comfortable and relaxing."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Bob and Fred are the best teachers possible; they take interest in developing each student as a scientist while teaching this class.","This is a great class. Period.","This is a fantastic course, though it is quite time consuming due to the amount of reading and understanding that is required.  But it is the best paper discussion based class I've taken.","fantastic instructors. this class informed the way i think about science.","Reading five papers a week requires a lot of your time, but they're worth it. The more you're prepared for the discussion, the more you'll learn from it.","This was one of the best classes I've taken here at Harvard.  It requires a large time commitment, and the discussions are intense, but I learned a ton from Fred and Bob.  They are also hilarious together."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.78","workload":"2.78","difficulty":"3.67","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GENETIC 216","course_id":"3100","cat_num":"2244","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GENETIC 216","course_id":"3100","cat_num":"2244","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GENETIC 216","course_id":"3100","cat_num":"2244","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
