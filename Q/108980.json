Easily a top 3 class I've taken at Harvard.","One of the best classes I took in my four years here. The material is fascinating, the class is structured perfectly, and the teaching is fantastic.","TAKE THIS COURSE","If you want to experience colorblindness, motion blindness, and other awesome weird phenomena, or if you're just interested in consciousness or philosophy of mind, take this class!","This course will be more about vision and attention that you probably think. You might also think that you will understand consciousness at the end of the course. You will not. Turns out, it is a hard problem. However, you will pretty much learn all there is to know about the scientific study of consciousness, which is pretty awesome. This class was engaging, it had awesome demos, amazing teachers, great reading, and basically no work. The class made me think and I looked forward to it every week.","This course, despite being new, is absolutely extraordinary. Michael is a superb TF and his lectures are some of the best I've seen. He does a great job going over the readings thoroughly and making sure everyone understands them. The readings (and the topic of consciousness in general) are actually interesting, and the workload is pretty minimal. Just read the papers well and come to class - it's not asking a lot and you learn a whole bunch. I find myself reflecting on the stuff learned in this class on a daily basis, despite not even being a psych concentrator (I took this class because it looked interesting), which makes this class a huge success for me. The only thing to watch out for is the paper at the end. It's worth a bulk of your grade, and being the only big assignment, you don't really know what the expectations are.","The course reviews a variety of studies about consciousness. The results are very interesting, but as the field is relatively new, the conclusions that can be drawn are very narrow. However, you will learn about the state of the art in consciousness research.","This was my favorite class I've taken at Harvard so far. It was interesting, new material that you won't learn in other psychology courses. Michael is the main lecturer and does an amazing job of delivering the material clearly and with great enthusiasm. The class is formatted to make you feel extremely comfortable talking in class, which leads to some great discussions. The final paper gives you freedom to explore what you are interested in, and really just expand your knowledge. They don't believe in busy work so you can take this class to learn and be interested rather than fight for a grade. Take this class, you won't regret it!! After almost every class we would leave and all talk about how cool the material had been, and keep discussing the class long after it had finished.","A really excellent, fascinating class. I strongly recommend it to everyone.","This was an amazing class that was not only not that much work, but super fun. The teaching staff are amazing in terms of personality and always engaging during class. I often looked forward to coming to this class.","This is a fantastic class that will challenge you to think much more deeply about how you experience the world."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.67","workload":"1.33","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.73","enrollment":"16","response rate":"93.75","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
