She definitely will do her best to improve your writing, and I think that at least in my case, she succeeded. However, in my opinion, the title of the course is a bit of a misnomer, the first two units had very little to do with \"American criminals.\" This was basically a literature expos class for those first two units, something I was not happy about. In addition, class is a drag and incredibly boring. Two hours of nap time a week!","Expos is a struggle regardless of what class you take. Most of the reading in this class is interesting.","As far as expos classes go, this one is pretty good. The material is interesting, and Lindsey was a great preceptor. The last paper especially is a lot of fun to write.","This isn't one of those flamboyantly awesome expos classes where you're discussing really exciting material, but that said, this is definitely one of the better ones. Lindsay is a chill instructor who gives great feedback, theres not a lot of reading required but you learn a lot, and the material is pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend putting this as one of your top choices","The times in class are fun, but the writing is not as enjoyable as I had hoped.","I can't compare the class to other expos sections, but expos in general is a pretty frustrating class, especially because everyone has to take it. The grading will be relatively subjective (and unrealistically harsh compared to other classes), so I think all expos classes should be pass\/fail on this basis.","This course is really interesting and fun. Studying different crime theories, reading a novel about crime, discussing reasons behind various crimes in class, and researching a crime on my own was really exciting."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"14","response rate":"78.57","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.247","course_id":"11482","cat_num":"34777","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.247","course_id":"11482","cat_num":"34777","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.247","course_id":"11482","cat_num":"34777","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
