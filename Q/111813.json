The workload is manageable and you certainly learn a lot, if you haven't done American government before.","Very interesting subject, great readings, good but uninspiring lectures.","You must do it all for yourself because no one is going to meet you even half way.","Section does a thorough job of explaining the week's lectures.

The weekly assignments have a tendency to sneak up on you, so just make sure that you plan ahead for those.","i literally hated this class. i learned nothing. what a waste of time. i was thinking of concentrating in government before taking this class and then i realized the gov department at harvard is soulless. the weekly assignments were such a pain and the directions were always unclear. the 3 papers were frustrating as well not because they were intellectually challenging but because it was unclear what they wanted and they were graded so arbitrarily.\r\n\r\nthis all probably comes off really scathing & harsh but i'm just being honest.","avoid this class. The syllabus is deceiving and you will learn more if you just buy the book and read it over the summer and take a two day course on how to use excel.","This class was decent but the weekly assignments were really annoying.","The subject matter is really interesting, and Prof. A is a great lecturer. The only complaint I have about this course is that I found the grading to be rather arbitrary.","course tries very hard, and with some success, to make material interesting;","The course teaches you very little and all of the assignemnts are painful and have little to do with the course.","Interesting class. Not too hard. Includes a lot of introductory political science and analytical tools","this class will not overwork you, but you will leave with a much greater understanding of the way our country works, how we choose our leaders, and the history of the evolution of our unique political system","Doing the reading the week it's due, participating in section, and going to class will help you learn the material more than enough.","It's a really good class to take if you have genuine interest in American government because otherwise, lectures can feel somewhat dry and the readings are not necessarily exciting.","Too much work is assigned for what is an introductory class, but what you learn from it is worth the effort.","Never, never, never take this class. It is just a HUGE WASTE of time. Short weekly assignments required using Excel and took 2-3 hours every week. Just a HUGE WASTE of time.","If you want to learn how American government works, as well as some basic skills in taking and analyzing political data, this is a great case to do that.","SUPER EASY. TAKE IT.","This class is good if you want an easy, but boring course. I think there are much better American Government courses that I would rather have taken for my American Govt requirement, and the TFs aren't very good. I ended up feeling like I hadn't learned much that I didn't already know.","If you're looking for an incredibly easy core, take this.  If you're looking for a genuine educational experience, don't.","The idea of studying american government was quite exciting to me, but this class was set up so poorly that it was not a great experience overall","This course is a great, painless way to learn about American government. Be prepared to learn research methods in addition to factual material. This is not only about acquiring a foundation of knowledge on U.S. politics; students must assume a new approach to rationalizing the way rules influence policymaking and shape the nation. If you are not a numbers person, assignments might be challenging. The professor is knowledgeable, approachable, and kind!","Overall, this course is a wonderful introduction to American government and politics. The lectures can sometimes be dull, since the professor does not use slides, but he is a great lecturer with some interesting personal experiences in politics. There are two papers that require you to observe politics in action - don't be scared! These were relatively painfree. The only thing I would warn about is that the weekly section responses were sometimes really tedious and vague, and may take more time first appears. In the whole, though, this is a great class that is fairly easy and a good way to learn about government and (for me) fulfill a core\/gen ed.","This course involves a lot of theory, be ready to have a lot of homework","This class is full of extremely boring lectures that are totally unnecessary to attend to do well; it can be pretty much self-taught out of the textbook and section.","The professor and his lectures are outstanding","I would say that you will come out of this class with a much deeper understanding of the political institutions in America on all levels than you probably ever would have expected before.","I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to fulfill a requirement or wants a general informational course on American history.","You will understand Americans politics so much more clearly after taking this class -- things like the electorate.","The course focuses a lot on American politics.","This is a course that every informed college student should take, just to put themselves into perspective of American government and politics. Professor Ansolabehere may be slightly timid a professor, but he gives very effective lectures that are very informative. In addition, taking this course really changes your perspective of how politics work. This is very much a sneak peek at the world of politics from the inside.","Take this course the best intro government class offered.","This course, while relatively easy in terms of course load, is very strict in terms of grading. The grading on papers was especially severe. Nonetheless, the course is very helpful and useful to take.","My least favorite class at Harvard, poorly taught with terrible assignments.","While I did learn a great deal about American Government structure, a lot of my time was wasted with statistical analysis assignments.","This class was more confusing than helpful. The unstructured assignments and readings just served as a nuisance, rather than a learning tool.","take good notes in lecture","This class was pretty easy and did not require that much work a week, but the lectures were not the most interesting. If you're looking for an amazing professor, I would probably not take this course, but there was not much reading a week and for the final, we got to make up multiple choice and essay questions ourselves and use these as a study guide.","This class is amazing if you don't have much background in American government. The pace is reasonable, the assignments give great insight, and this class showed me the science aspect of political science. (I'm a science concentrator.)","Take this class if you're interested in the theory and practice behind U.S. government. Even if you excelled in AP Government in high school, Gov 30 might be a good addition because it covers political theory, spatial models, etc. much more deeply. The workload is definitely manageable and the papers are helpful. Lectures are sometimes on the boring side but it helps to attend because you'll have a head start on discussion in section.","very interesting, slightly non traditional perspective on gov\r\nthe class is partially quantitative (thank goodness) so makes the class not as fluffy\/ivory tower academic\/boring as other gov\/humanity classes; if you're too much of an ass to learn to compute the median in excel (hint: look up the function called MEDIAN), just shut up and take something else","Easy class, but you learn a lot. Lecture may be boring if you're not interested in the material, but for those who are, class is very enriching","With some organization and improvement, the class would certainly be worth taking. The professor and most of the TFs are accessible and always willing to help. Lectures aren't particularly exciting, but the professor always tries to generate debate and encourage students to participate. He seems genuinely interested in their opinions. The workload isn't difficult, but the weekly excercises can quickly become annoying and confusing.","Have you ever tried to use one of those knives that struggle to cut through even a block of warm butter? Yea, that's a pretty accurate metaphor for the dullness of this course. If you've taken a high school government class, there is no reason to even think about taking this course.","You aren't allowed computers in lectures, be prepared for that.","it's a little dry but has valuable information for a government concentrator"]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This class is an easy introduction to American politics, but there were lots of weekly assignments in the first half of the semester.","I would take this if I really knew NOTHING about American Gov, but if you have a basic understanding, I would skip ahead to a more interesting course.","Take it seriously! You will learn a lot.","If you are engaged by government and politics, this course is a must!!","the readings don't matter. short papers throughout the semester do not require much work. fun class","This course is an introduction to American politics- and, thus, deals with issues that the traditional AP Gov class would have also covered. A few times, it requires independent trips into Boston\/Cambridge to witness \"the masterpiece\" of our government at work.","You'll learn a lot about American politics and the political system, and you'll likely get a fairly balanced view of it.  You may not like all of the assignments, but most of them do help you learn more concretely about the subject matter.","I think the class is relatively easy, if you keep up with readings, pay attention in lecture and section, and study before the exams. There are no surprises in the class. Bernard is the best TF ever! Just do the work and try to stay with the readings and you'll really be fine. The response papers are a little tedious in the beginning of the semester, but it's doable and really easy.","What seemed like the potential for a fantastic course simply fell apart when it came time for execution. The lectures were boring, particularly during Stephen Ansolabehere's portion of lectures. Professor Peterson tried his best by integrating slides and graphics. Teaching Fellow Joe Williams is entertaining and will some day make a great professor. The weekly sections can be a bit useless at times and the weekly essay assignments are nothing short of brutal. They are not particularly difficult, but prove to be a big nuisance! I originally took this course as a freshman after reading the Q scores, as you're doing now. I decided that while most students said that the course is boring, I should take it because they also say that it is easy. I completely regret that decision. It is only wasting my time when the material is not engaging to me. It is much more rewarding to take a class that will expand your mind and challenge you a bit.","This class is very interesting and it deepens your understanding of American government.","If you want an easy gov class, this is the one.  Little previous knowledge of American government is necessary.","This course is an easy introduction to American politics. Although lectures are boring, the readings are useful and the assignments and exams are very fair.","Both professors were great and clearly extremely knowlegable about the subject matter. Particularly liked the concentration on elections and the currency of the discussions about politics.","This class will get you interested in politics, if for some reason you aren't already.","I loved this class, and getting to take a class with Ansolabehere is an awesome way to get introduced to the Gov department and to meet a really awesome professor!","you will gain great understand abt american gov and politics","its pretty easy, not too much work.

If you want to get an overview of american politics and how the American political system works you should definitely take this course. it's okay to skip lectures from time to time too. but do not miss sections.","It's a great course where you'll learn quite a bit about American government.","The workload isn't that difficult, but the material isn't that interesting, either.","Not very challenging but still interesting.","If you're interested in American Government, take the course.  It's as simple as that.","Read the textbook and you will be able to get much more out of the lectures.","This course gives great insight into America's system of government and how it works and why things happen the way they do.  It is especially interesting because we get to apply what we learn to what is going on in the news."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["This class is a great primer to American government, and covers a wide range of topics. The lectures aren't thrilling, but section is interesting and you definitely learn a lot if you haven't already taken similar courses.","While the papers are a little challenging, overall I would definitely recommend this course as an introductory class for government concentrators.","Overall, this course is a pretty good introduction to American government for those who haven't studied it before. The material covered gives a comprehensive (though not in-depth) overview of all aspects of government and political science. However, the lectures are sometimes pretty dry and may be unorganized and unrelated to the readings. This might encourage you not to do the readings as much, which can be a major problem when exams and papers come around. If you do the readings, however, section is pretty interesting. Overall, it's a decent course for just being introduced to the study of government, but, in order to get something out of it, you really have to do the readings and teach yourself a lot of the material, because it won't be reviewed fully in lecture.","You will definitely learn the historical dynamics of American politics: why is it how it is today.","What you get out of this class is highly dependent on how much effort you put into the readings and how much you think about the subject. It is not a hard class, and it can reduce to a very superficial experience if you don't keep up with the work.","Not necessarily stimulating (even though the subject matter could be).","This class is a great class for becoming confident in your knowledge about American politics.","Very informative and helpful class that is easy to manage if the right amount of work is put in.","I was excited by the potential this class had to offer, but the course was ultimately not very well structured\/organized, which lowered the quality of our interaction with the material. However, Ansolabehere is an engaging lecturer and my TF was excellent, so I think with a few improvements this course could be a great elective or way to fulfill a Gov requirement.","I would recommend this course because there is not much work involved, but it is not particularly interesting or compelling.","The material is extremely interesting, but the professors like to ramble on about tangential topics and skip important aspects of the reading. Rita was a great TF, and she was the reason I actually learned anything. The papers suck, plain and simple.","A workaday government class. Do it for the requirement and nothing else.","if you're a math\/science person, know a bit about politicks, and want to knock out a gen-ed easily, take this class.","You may be inclined to take this course if you are working toward a Government concentration and would like an easier spot in your schedule. However, I did not find this course engaging or challenging. If you are going to invest hours in attending lecture and section, I suggest you spend your time in a more fruitful way. On the bright side teaching staff are very friendly and accessible.","This class interested me more when it got to the judicial branch's material. Otherwise, it was a bit dry, and the assignments and exams were much harder than I feel the course necessarily prepared you for.","its good","Its a pretty easy course, a good way to fulfill a requirement. But the lectures are seriously boring. Assignments aren't too bad, the paper topics are really interesting.","If you took AP American Government, this course will seem very repetitive.","Good course.  Gives you the fundamentals of US government.  Interesting assignments and helpful sections.","This course provides a nice introduction to American government and politics. However, it tends to be disorganized and it seems that the exams do not really measure knowledge of the course material. In addition, lectures do not always help understand the material. Overall, however, this is a nice class if you really want to learn about the American political system.","This is one of the worst classes I have taken at Harvard. The subject has enormous potential, but a combination of egregiously apathetic teaching staff and mono-toned professors make this class painful. The assignments are considerably longer than the average government class, but the material  is considerably easier. This combination makes the work tedious and uninspiring. Definitely would not recommend this class. The participatory nature of lectures is inefficient and really takes away from the classroom experience.","This is a class that gives you a decent overview of American politics. That said, it is very history-based, and the lectures are not particularly interesting.","This class will provide a good overview of the major themes in American politics. Great for international students or Americans who want to get a solid grounding in American politics. It hasn't been my most interesting class, but I have found it very useful.\r\n\r\nIf you are already familiar with US politics, e.g. look AP US Politics, then I wouldn't recommend this class. Take a Gov Class out of your comfort zone.","Dull lectures, interesting paper assignments.","Good course, especially for people who know nothing about the government. A slightly hard gen ed, but good if you want to learn.","The lectures are not that interesting, so make sure to do the reading and prepare for class because not everything is covered during lecture.","I really enjoyed it and would recommend it as a class that maintains a current affairs aspect to it.","This is a great basic introduction to American government and politics.  If you took AP Government in high school, then it covers a lot of the same material.","the syllabus may say 2 lectures and 1 section a week, but they fail to mention that in the second half of the course you are required to watch online videos of a pre-recorded lecture before coming to most lectures...and then you just talk about those videos as a lecture. So it essentially becomes three sections a week. just a heads up. otherwise the course was straightforward. if you want to fine-tune your knowledge about the American government, this is the place to do it.","This class has the potential to be so great. The subject matter truly is interesting, so I would recommend it those who have an interest in American government, although the lectures are disjointed. It would be greatly improved if Professor Peterson and Ansolabehere coordinated what they taught better and made the course a more comprehensive overview of American government. Section is great though. Take Rita's section if she's still a TF.","It's a fairly interesting class that won't be too much work. Some lectures seemed to lack direction.","keep up with the reading materials. watch peterson's lectures--they disappear after the lecture date!","Not necessary if you already know a lot about American government. The course basically goes over what was taught in AP Government.","This is a good intro to American government and politics.  If you've already taken AP Government, you probably don't need to take it, but it does give you the opportunity to take the fundamentals of American government and apply them to fundamental issues.","So long as you keep up with the reading, you will be successful in the class.","If you can pay attention during lectures, the course will solidify your knowledge about the American Government","It's easy but wasn't run well when I took it. Easy, not challenging, you don't learn much.","Gov 30 is a great class if you can keep up with the readings. The selections are very interesting, because you get the formal, factual structure of government and its functions in today's society, coupled with the philosophical background and origins of its conception.","Good class, even if you think you know everything about american government, still take this class, new insights and good, knowledgeable profs","This class is very introductory and you do not need a lot of background in the American Government to take this. I also learned a lot of interesting things because I didn't have any background in it and it was very fun.","Take this if you have no understanding of American politics. If you do, then it's largely a review of the basics.","It's a good course if you haven't had rigorous preparation in US Government or if you had it long ago and would like to refresh your mind. If you're a politics savant or \"hardcore\" Gov concentrator, you may not want to waste your time with this course and move on to something more specific than an overview of all of US Politics.","The lectures are bland and tell you information that's basically common knowledge.  Also, the syllabus said two 4-6 page papers with a midterm and final and it ended up being a 10-15 and a 8-10.  Take Gov 20 and skip ahead to something more exciting instead of this.","This class will provide you with a basic level of understanding for American Politics, but if you are really knowledgable or want to be challenge, you may be disappointed in this course. In terms of difficulty, this is not Gov. 20.","This is a great class for international students. As a Canadian, knowing nothing about American politics, I felt it was very informative, didn't require any previous knowledge and I took a lot away from the class. It isn't super difficult and I feel like I really learned something that is real life applicable. If you have already taken gov courses or are American, I know a lot of people fin it boring and redundant. if you are an international student definitely take it!!!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class is a great way to satisfy your US and the World gen-ed. The work is manageable. The lectures can be a bit of a drag since you see everything in the videos.","There are very many long readings assigned, however there are also lecture videos that Professor Peterson provides that cover most of the information to learn from the readings.  This class is very manageable.","Great class, only draw back is quizzes every section, which forces you to read and gets you prepared for the midterm and final, but it also causes a great deal of stress","Gives a good overview of American politics.","This class was good. It covers a huge range of topics, pretty much all aspects of American government but doesn't go too in depth on any of them, so it's a good introduction. Written assignments are manageable. Lecture videos are watched at home and then class is more of a discussion than a lecture.","This course is fairly boring if you have taken any US classes before, but is easy for the exact same reason.  It's a low-effort way to fulfill a requirement.","Super manageable course and a good overview of American government. One midterm, one term paper, and a final. Relevant and applicable material which is always refreshing.","It is worthwhile.","Okay there is literally no single bigger waste of time than having the videos online and then a quiz on the video in lecture...and then a lecture that is a repetition of the video I watched the night before and just had a quiz on. It was almost kind of insulting. And I think the reason he set the class up that way was so that people would come prepared and we could have a discussion in lecture, but what ended up happening was people would take the quiz and get those points then BOUNCE. Then the same 4 people would participate, and everyone else would sleep. So dumb.I didn't do AP Gov in high school or any kind of gov in high school, and my knowledge of the government was pretty basic (3 branches, elections happen, how to pass a bill). After taking this class....that's still pretty much it. We rush through so much I don't remember anything. Still pretty easy though but so boring I would take ANY other US and the World gen ed course.","Do not take this class.  this was one of the worst classes I have taken at harvard.  we had to do the chapter readings in the text book, then the professor went over the EXACT SAME material in a mandatory video that we had to watch for homework.  Then lectures were a chance for the professor to repeat the same material in the video.  It was the most pointless class I have ever taken and I am horrified that it was offered to Harvard students.","The class is easy, but it's not worth the hoops you need to jump through. Lectures are required and incredibly dull, because all the information was already given in the required video lectures before each class. I felt like I was being treated like a highschool student the entire time, which was very frustrating at times.","I'd recommend the course IF students are looking for a comprehensive set of knowledge of American government - that is, the basic ideas of many of its aspects. The course, which seeks to provide a wide overview of basic ideas rather than focusing on one aspect of government, does just that, and does it well (lots of good take away points).","Course is very interesting, other than daily reading quizzes, not much work is necessary.","Not difficult for students knowledgable of U.S. government, but great for those looking to learn.","informs you effectively about american government","All you need to do for the class is watch the lecture videos because there is a quiz almost every day. They're easy if you've watched the videos. All that lecture is, is a big group discussion that only 15 people at most participate in. Section is pretty boring and pointless since everything was already discussed in lecture. If that is the kind of thing your looking for, than this class is great. Boring. If you can't handle being bored, do not take this class. Don't do it.","It's easy if you've done AP gov. It's more interesting if you're an international student.","When doing the reading for the week, prioritize the videos.","It's a good class and not very time consuming. The quizzes at the beginning of each lecture were perhaps the downside to the course, but worth it.","It is a good class to learn some of the basics of our government","Very detailed and interesting class on American government","If you are wondering how to fulfill your concentration requirement with an American politics class, TAKE IT! Also, if you want a doable gen ed class, TAKE IT! Also, if you are an international student and are willing to find out more about American politics, TAKE IT! It's super rewarding given that I had barely any knowledge about American government. A lot of people might tell you that it's ridiculously easy but if you barely have a background in this topic, you are likely to find it challenging!","There were quizzes before every lecture (twice a week) and although they were a pain, they were not that bad and forced you to atleast watch the videos.","This is a great course for freshmen to take. Most people have probably been exposed to some of the ideas of this course in high school, and this course allows for these ideas to be expounded upon and related to government as a whole.","This is a basic introductory American government class. Every class you'll have a little quiz on the videos\/readings assigned for that lecture so you really have to be on top of all the material at all times. But it makes studying for the midterm and final a lot easier because you'll find that you already know much of the material. There is one term paper, but it is not that long and is fairly graded by the TFs. Take this class for a good, simple government course!","great class","Take it, it's not difficult and you learn a lot!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This course really gives you wonderful insight into how and why the United States government works and what problems exist in this imperfect system. The workload isn't too bad and watching the lecture videos before class really does help with remembering the material.","It is a very early course. Section and lecture are very helpful in understanding the material. Also, the videos are key to studying for the midterm and exams.","Great introductory course. The teaching staff is wonderful and makes you want to continuing leaning about the topics.","do your work and you'll get a good grade","The structure is great","material is a bit repetitive","Good introduction to American government, not very engaging","The class is pretty easy if you watch the lectures, and you learn quite a bit about America: past and present.","This is a great, easy class. You basically watch the lectures online before class, then come in and discuss the topics. Highly recommend!","I would say keep up with the lecture videos each night because you are quizzed almost everyday at the beginning of class.","Peterson is adorable. He is passionate about the material and is a good lecturer. Definitely take this class if you're a Gov concentrator--it will be well worth your time. You cover a lot of material ranging from the ideology of the Founding Fathers to debating policy solutions for how to fix medicare. If you're not a Gov concentrator and are looking for an easy and relatively painless elective, this is a class well worth your time.","If you're looking for an interesting gov course that isn't too hard, I definitely recommend this class. Great way to learn more about the American political system, but you won't learn too much if you know a lot already. The class focuses a lot on Supreme Court cases, so consider it if that interests you.","Watch the videos and you'll crush the class.","Gov 30 was a great class. Take it if you are looking for a class with low weekly commitment.","This course is a fairly bland, broad overview of American government. If you've already taken an American government class in high school, 80-90% of the material will be review. So, if you're concentrating or interested in Gov, it's a low workload, fairly easy class. But if you're looking for something a bit more probing or stimulating in the field of American government, it is probably better to look elsewhere.","Good solid course.","Exactly what a Gen Ed should be: Learn a lot and stress a little. USW was the gen ed I was dreading to take, but this class was painless, interesting and informative. It is the ideal class for someone looking to brush up on their knowledge of American history, government and law. It felt good to fill the void of ignorance on some of the basic facts of American politics. The class takes you through the major Supreme court cases that have shaped America since its founding, and familiarizes you with the basics of tax and social policy, economic policy, foreign and defense policy, congressional decision making, interest groups, public opinion, civil liberties and rights, the modern court system, and, most importantly, our Constitution. I learned many new yet fundamental concepts each week. I honestly think everyone should take this class (or a class like it). No matter what field you're going to be a leader in, it is important to know the principals upon which our country stands and runs. And like I said, the work outside of class is minimal. You watch lecture videos and write one paper (maybe two next year, but that's it). Highly recommended.","If you just take the 45 minutes to watch the course videos, you will be set for this class. Very light workload, very easy if you've ever taken any kind of American government course. The professor is a fantastic guy and the whole course is just a nice gut course to have on your schedule.","This course is a really great course to develop foundational understanding of American government.","A good intro class and transition to college gov classes because most first semester freshmen have taken American history or gov in high school and will be easy to pick up on the course content","The lecture videos Mr. Peterson puts up help a whole lot, but in person his lectures can be a bit repetitive.","Take it. Especially if you're looking for an easy to way to fulfill a gen-ed. \nThis class is incredibly easy, and it's precisely because it's so easy that I felt I actually learned a lot. \nYou have to work and keep up, but the absence of the stress of having to excel makes the learning process quite fun indeed. Do yourself a favor.","the videos are tedious to watch and remember everything for the quiz the next day","This is a great introduction to american government and a good way to experience what government classes at Harvard are like after school. The class covers everything you would want to know from the Founding Fathers to contemporary issues that are still being debated and I would highly recommend it.","Easy, straightforward course. Doesn't require a lot of time.","This is a great class to learn the foundations of American government and politics. It builds off American history and ties it to current events (for example we wrote a paper about the Senate election that was going on at the time). I felt like this class was a great introduction to the Government department and was really interesting while not being too overwhelming and stressful. Make sure to watch the lecture videos before class (there are quizzes each class, but they are not difficult if you watched the video) and you will learn even more if you do the readings as well! Overall I really recommend this class.","You won't have to do a ton of work, but you'll learn a lot and can get a great grade if you pay attention to the lecture videos.","This course seems like AP US history, but with an emphasis on judicial decisions. It was interesting to take during an year with elections. Unfortunately, Peterson pretty much repeats himself in lecture - you're required to watch a set of videos before each lecture (about 30-45 minutes).  Still, the reiteration of the material makes it easy to remember, so you won't feel lost as long as you're attending lecture.  Section is very chill and does a good job of clarifying important points. The exams were pretty straight forward, but make sure to memorize all relevant court cases. The essay questions are fairly open-ended, so as long as you can base your hypothesis with cases, you shouldn't have to worry.","It is a very dry class that will require a lot of work outside the classroom in order to completely understand the material, but it provides great insight into American politics and the structure of the American government.","If you are looking to develop a greater understanding of the American Government, this class is the perfect course for you. If you are simply looking to become a more informed citizen, this class is perfect for you. This class looks at American Government in a way that many other American Government courses do not, which is refreshing. You will definitely exit this course an informed citizen better able to understand the politics of today.","Watch lecture videos and you will be fine. Lectures should not repeat what the videos say, but sadly, they do. Try to get Chris as your section TF, he is wonderful.","I would say that it is good for learning about American government, but a lot of time is wasted."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"3.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"62","response rate":"75.81","QCourseOverall":{"number":"GOV 30","course_id":"2151","cat_num":"0263","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"14","4s":"16","5s":"14"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"GOV 30","course_id":"2151","cat_num":"0263","1s":"3","2s":"16","3s":"29","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"GOV 30","course_id":"2151","cat_num":"0263","1s":"14","2s":"27","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
