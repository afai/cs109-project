Professor Giron-Negron is an amazing lecturer--just listening to him speak is a treat you don't want to miss. This class will expose you to a wide swath of medieval love poetry and give you the freedom to choose which poems beg you to engage deeply with them. This class is good for your soul!","The course is really interesting and Professor Giron Negron is really fantastic! Take it!","Lit 193 is a course like no other. You'll read poems in a dozen languages you don't speak, and Professor Giron is a genius. Make sure to take some course with him.","The syllabus is excellent and Professor Negron is remarkably versed in the material- my biggest challenge to new students would be to not be intimidated by his knowledge to the point that speaking up in class doesn't happen... I think the class could have been more engaging if more students had felt comfortable talking out about the poems."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.10","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"13","response rate":"76.92","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
