The workload is manageable but the learning curve is very steep.","Very interesting material! Johanna is very warm, knowledgable and engaging! She's great!","The subject matter is incredibly interesting, and Prof. Gutlerner is great!","absolutely amazing class, the material is fascinating, I mean who doesn't want to learn about how drugs affect your brain? The weekly assignments, presentation, and final paper were very challenging but in a good way. I 100 percent recommend this class to all neurobio concentrators.","This class is great. It is a very interesting look into drug addiction focused mainly on readings. The assignments prior to class make this more of a pain than other tutorials and even some other classes, but you get a lot out of it with little stress over your grade. Just do the work ahead of time and you'll find yourself really enjoying classes.","I feel that the class is missing the essential background information that is required to take the class, but perhaps this will change in the future. The readings are fantastic and Johanna is great, as are the presentations that we prepare. I would recommend taking the class, but I would say that you need background information to truly understand everything."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is an amazing course, and if Johanna decides to teach it again take it! It may require a little more work than other neuro seminars, but you'll learn a lot more from it. Johanna helps you along the way, and at least this year's class provide a stimulating and accepting environment as well!","This class is an excellent tutorial but definitely sufficiently challenging. I learned a lot about how to properly write and read neurobiology papers but be ready to work. Definitely one of the more challenging Neuro tutorials but Johanna is absolutely brilliant so it is worth it to learn from her.","This course provided an in-depth study of addiction that was comprehensive.  The primary literature was well selected and highly informative.  The year-long duration and seminar class size were conducive to learning.","If  you are interested  in learning  about the neurobiological basis of drug addiction and learning mor about how drugs effect behavior take this class. It may be more work than some neuron tutorials but Johanna is a great professor and you will learn so much about drug addiction and reading scientific literature.","I would really not recommend this class it sounds really cool and fun and you will learn much about neurobiology\/drug addiction but at the expense of ruining your junior year. Johanna is an impossible grader with unbelievably high expectations for her students. You will write on average four pages and read 20 pages of dense scientific literature for every class, be forced to make a 45 min presentation, and do a grant symposium at the end of the year where you are forced to verbally grade your peers in front of the entire class. Easily the most stressful class I've taken at Harvard which makes no sense because its a year-long tutorial that should be easier than regular classes...","This course allowed me to grow as a scientist. I was able to learn so much about the field of neurobiology throughout this year, and I felt like I really improved. I am comfortable reading papers, discussing them in a journal-club setting, giving in-depth presentations, and writing grant proposals - this class has it all! I recommend this class with enormous enthusiasm - although it may be moderately challenging, it is incredibly interesting and rewarding."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Johanna is just wonderful. She really knows the material, is supportive and helpful and kind, eager to connect and engage with the class. The papers are all interesting. Expectations are always laid out and are absolutely reasonable.  I recommend with enthusiasm!","Great class! Johanna is awesome, the material is really interesting, and you learn a lot without ever begin stressed by the amount of material.","This is a great class.  Johanna is fantastic.  One of those classes you enjoy going to and thinking about.","Its interesting and Johanna is great at teaching! If you're passionate about research and drugs, its definitely for you. I'm not that passionate about research, so sometimes reading the scientific papers is annoying. Writing a grant proposal definitely is a challenge, especially for me because I'm not research oriented. With that said, its a good class and I'm happy I'm in it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfi","course_id":"11069","cat_num":"57397","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfi","course_id":"11069","cat_num":"57397","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 101hfi","course_id":"11069","cat_num":"57397","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
