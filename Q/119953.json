If you're just looking for an intro to CS that's not as overwhelming as CS50, this is a friendly, chill intro to wrapping your brain around the concept of coding, focusing on the java programming language.","A lot of tedious work, but I found it relatively interesting and would feel quite accomplished upon completion of each problem set. Sad but true.","It's much easier than what I heard of CS50, but it's still computer science and still difficult. However, if you really want to learn some things about programming, it will definitely help you out.","Great intro to CS.","The problem sets definitely became difficult towards the end and would eat up weekends sometimes.  Taking the class your senior spring is not the best idea if you have a thesis because you may (as I did) fall behind during some of the critical periods of the class.","the problem sets take a long time to complete","Easy to understand class with steep learning curve","Be aware of late nights when the problem sets come","Knowledge in html and java are both useful computer science languages to know for the future. Just be prepared to spend a good amount of time on problem sets!","Although this course was great as an elective (by choice), it might not be worth taking if you're doing it for core credit only. I'm sure there are QR classes out there that do not require as much work and which are not as difficult. Otherwise, if you're interested in CS or would like to learn something interesting and useful, this is a great course to jump into a great coding language.","I would tell them this is a great class because it gives you a solid foundation to understand how computers work and the kinds of energy it has taken to get our technology to where it is today.","Anyone who wants to know about computer programming should take this course!","If you enjoy learning about computer programming or solving logic problems you will enjoy this class.","I would recommend it as a QR class...","Great class if you want to learn programming basics buy not surrounded by CS students. I've never been in a class with so much support and people that really love the material. Really fun elective where you learn a lot!","great introduction to computing!","Take this course if you really want to learn about CS.

It is the perfect fit for people who are interested in CS but aren't ready to jump into CS50. It made me want to take CS50 and now I am much more prepared. Professor Leitner is awesome, and 60% of the grade is homework. Doesn't get much better than that.","Don't fall behind on the problem sets!","START YOUR PROBLEM SETS EARLY! Otherwise this class can be really hard. Definitely go to office hours they're really helpful. Don't skip class, its really hard to catch up and teach yourself.","I really enjoyed this class.","Good preparation for CS 50 and other CS classes. You learn how to program, at a reasonable pace.","I took the course pass\/fail and it really took the pressure off but there is plenty of extra credit offered in the course that if you wanted to take it for a letter grade, you could easily do well. The professor says the problem sets should take about 4 hours a week but they actually probably take closer to 10 unless you have a really good understanding of the programming involved.","I don't\/won't concentrate in CS, and was very hesitant about whether to take this course in reading period. Upon reflection taking this course is one of the best decisions I took this semester. It's a CS world now, and I would say an overview of computer science is a must not matter what you do in the future. Yes, this course is a downgrade from CS50, but it does teach you legit CS instead of fooling you around. So do be prepared to do work! If you are just taking this course as an elective expecting to learn some CS, take it pass\/fail as I did.","This is the perfect introduction to computer science for anyone who isn\u00c2\u00b4t sure they`ll be brilliant at programming or anyone that doesn`t want to give up their social lives to take cs50.","I learned a lot, but I feel like it's still not enough to do anything cool in java. HTML was the best part, but after that, I was lost. So this class is worth it just to have learned HTML, but if you are worried about your GPA, either take it pass\/fail, or don't take it, and buy a textbook about HTML. Also, be prepared to go to office hours, but then not get much help because everyone else is at them too. And be prepared to have a bald spot on your head because you're going to rip your hair out.","more time consuming than one would expect! it's not CS 50, but still quite a challenge--make sure you have time for this course before signing up!","My best advice would be to start the problem sets early! I've always been a procrastinator and found this class very stressful at times.","It's a good class if you want to get an idea of what programming is all about, and understand how to use the basic concepts to write your own programs. Not too hard, though some of the later problem sets were challenging, and may require you to go to office hours.","Start on the psets EARLY (I cannot emphasise this enough). Some psets are difficult and you will need to run between office hours to get through them.","Painless and interesting. Great lecturer. What else can you ask for?","Take CS 50 if you want more in-depth programming","This is a great course for beginners. Moves really slow. Good alternative to CS50 if you have no further interest other than to dabble to get a basic understanding.","This class was by far the worst class I took at Harvard. Poorly taught in lecture coupled with an unprofessional TF made for the most painful academic experience of my life that has now ruined by GPA.","Although CS1 is probably not as intense as CS50, you still need to put in some time to do the psets, which start out really easy and get progressively harder. It's good to have friends who have taken CS before who can help you or to find someone in the class to do psets with. I thought it was manageable overall and a really good introduction to java. There's plenty of opportunity for extra credit too on the psets. Overall, I recommend to anyone who might be even a little interested in CS","This class is really interesting especially of you have never had any programming experience. BUT whoever tells you that this is an easy A does not speak the truth, especially if you have never programmed. Be ready to spend many hours on the problem sets!","This class is a good introduction to computer science that isn't rigorous like CS-50.  That being said, this easy class can become very difficult if you don't attend lecture and fall behind on problem sets.  Professor is a great teacher and makes himself very accessible to students.","Make sure to keep up with the material as most of it builds off of previous weeks.","The material is very interesting, but be warned that you will be learning almost exclusively java. The psets start out easy and then get very hard and time-consuming toward the end. Start early and go to office hours. It's easy to sink hours and hours into them without proper guidance.","I would say that this course is not as easy as it first seems. While there is a lot of extra credit, coding assignments in Java take longer than you may think. Some of the psets actually get pretty tedious later on. Be wary if you have no experience in programming. You may have to spend a lot of time learning and debugging. Overall, a great class though. Interesting topic and Professor Leitner is sick. I would definitely recommend for people looking to take an easy CS course to gain exposure to the topic.","It's an interesting course that will teach you useful basic skills and expose you to some fascinating topics. The lectures are a little dry but not intolerable. The problem sets are time-consuming but manageable. Just be careful with the final Java project--it can eat up a LOT of time.","it helps to have some background. people who aren't necessarily comfortable around computers should not take this class. It helps to also have a friend or two to help out. Don't take this class alone, unless you know a cs concentrator","If you have any interest in CS, this is a great course to take to test out the waters. be prepared to work copiously if you want to achieve a good grade.","A fun and fairly easy class. No coding experience required, although you'll end up with a pretty good background in Java by the time the class is done.","Great intro if you're thinking of doing more CS and have no background. Not too difficult, but you NEED to have time to go to office hours! Also it is a time consuming class, so don't pair it with a difficult course load. It is useful, but not easy, persay.","If you take this class, take CS50 afterwards.  This class gives a good base in Java programming and it would be a waste to let all that go!","Very manageable introduction to basic computer science - I had absolutely no background in CS and did not feel overwhelmed at all.","It is a very good intro into Computer Science, much gentler than CS50.  While it is not on the same par as CS50, it introduces many important concepts of programming and also has some tidbits of interesting information about computing history.","if you're nervous about cs50, take this course as it will ease you into the material","Take this course! Don't take it pass\/fail since there's almost as much extra credit on every problem set as there is real work.  It's super helpful to know how to program and the methodological thinking of a computer scientist.  Great class.","It's an interesting class and I'm glad I have a better sense of computer programming now."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Lectures will be interesting, but be prepared to learn almost everything on your own","Easiest class I've taken at Harvard. You only have psets once every two or three weeks, they are not very hard as long as you attend office hours. There are opportunities for extra credit points on every problem set. The teaching staff are really nice and want you to do well. Perfect elective for anyone with a casual interest in computer science.","This course is a great and easy opportunity to have a first look into computer science and to learn java, one of the main programming languages. The pace of the course is slow and the problem sets are not too difficult. So it's a great course for beginners, who don't want to take CS50 immediately. Be prepared to spent a lot of time on your final project if you decide to write a program instead of a paper.","Great class for anyone interested in CS","It's a wonderful class that is a lot slower paced and more personalized than CS50 is.  The professor is very enthusiastic about the class and really wants you to learn (which is extremely rare at Harvard for a base level intro class).  You can tell Leitner really enjoys teaching the class and he took us all out to the faculty lunch so he could get to know us better.  The class is very manageable, problem sets may take more time to work through in the last month of the class, but it's still a lighter workload than CS50.  You learn a lot about the field of CS in general and fascinating stories about its history.  I loved the class (it was probably my favorite this semester) and am so glad I took it. If you're looking for an intro level programming class in Java, it doesn't get much better than this.","Fantastic class!  The material is both interesting and challenging, but since the class is designed as an introduction it was never stressful and never required all-nighters.  If you are interested in learning computer science, but a little scared of CS50, take this instead!  Also, this class is a great senior spring elective.  The professor tries to be extremely flexible for students writing a thesis.","This course is amazing. It is really good for people that are thinking of a computer science concentration.","I am a senior and I wish I had taken this class earlier. If you are afraid of computer science, take this class! Don't wait till its too late and you don't get the chance to take more advanced CS classes after!","Don't take it if you're writing a thesis, you will get behind and find in unenjoyable!","If you have no programming experience please note that this class will not be easy for you. Completing even the simplest assignment will be time consuming and painful. Is it doable? Yes. Will you hate your life? Probably.","One of the few classes that will equip you with a tangible skill when exiting the class; goes at a moderate but not unreasonable pace. Be prepared to put in the hours for psets, but the skills you walk away are definitely work with.","you'll learn a lot.  but i strongly suggest you take it pass\/fail--you still have to do quite  a bit of work, but it's less stressful.","This is a pretty easy class.  BUT you have to do the homework and get all of the answers right (because homework is worth 60% of your grade).  So that majority of the semester you will have to really work to complete the problem sets and do the final project but the experience is fun and you will learn how to program at the end of the semester.","This class is a great way to learn about computer programming. I am definitely not a computer-savvy person by any standard (I have never even heard of UNIX before). However, by the end of the class, I am able to program my own java game in GUI!","take it, get ready to learn and work hard","It's a great course; you learn as much as CS 50, but a different language (java instead of C). It's graded easier, more relaxed, and there is more help. A great way to get a background before attempting CS50.","This is a good class to take if you are interested in computer science but do not feel ready for CS50. It also seems like it is good preparation if you want to take more CS classes."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If you are interested in learning some CS but don't want to commit to CS50, definitely take this course. It's a skill that everyone has to have and the professor delivers the content very well. He is also very enthusiastic about the material.","Great class with great professor. Good option for seniors looking to learn CS but too intimidated to take CS50. Start psets wayyy early and go to office hours. I took this class with my thesis and was fine.","Great class if you want to learn about computer science but have had no previous background.","Definitely take this course with friends. I wouldn't have made it through otherwise","GO TO LECTURE, otherwise you'll be completely lost.","This is a great class to take as a senior looking for an elective!! The professor and TFs are flexible if you're also working on a thesis (as I was). Other comments will say this too, but make sure you start problem sets earlier- they always take longer than expected. If you go to class and section, then you will not have major problems with the class, especially if you know nothing about CS.","I really got what I wanted to get out of this class. At the beginning of the semester, I had ABSOLUTELY no programming experience, and my knowledge of the inner workings of computers boiled down to myths involving little men with hammers. Now I know a little about both CS history and CS. You want a Java code? I'll write you a Java code!!","This class is a great way to start CS if you do not feel like you are ready to immediately jump into CS50. The professor is great and the TFs are very helpful and respond quickly to email.","Great intro to computer science class. Workload is very easy to manage and the project is cool.","This class taught me a ton about computer science, and I know how to use java semi-sufficiently now! I think it's a great introduction class that prepares you well for CS50. However, beware of the problem sets. They get pretty intense as the semester moves forward!","This class is brilliant; there is no way you could ever regret taking it. Professor Leitner is a fantastic lecturer, and he makes the material fun and interesting. The environment of the course is very very low pressure, and it is unlikely you will find this course stressful. The teaching staff is willing to work with you to understand the material, and they are quite flexible as long as you try. I give this course an A++, and it is suitable for anyone who is interested in computers and may want a more flexible introduction than CS50. You will still learn tons of interesting information, and you may be surprised by how much you enjoy the coding.","The psets take a long time, so be prepared to work hard on those and go to office hours.  However, there are only 6 of them, so if you spread the work out, it's not too bad.  The exam was pretty hard and the average was fairly low, but it does not count for a large percentage of the grade.","A great introductory course for those interested in dabbling in computer science. If you're looking for an easy A, I wouldn't recommend this class since a decent amount of effort is required for the problem sets and preparing for the exam. However, if this is a subject you really want to try out (as it was for me), it is worth the effort. Take the class.","This is a relatively easy class. However, keep in mind that the structure of the assignments allows for a lot of hand-holding that doesn't really prepare you for the mid-term exam. Otherwise, a good and easy class for someone with little experience but an engaged interest in the field of computers.","Was a great P\/F class as a senior. Learned a few things about programming without the stress.","Good intro to coding, both practical and theoretical. Not as useful for learning the inner mechanics of how computers work. Leitner is an engaging lecturer with very broad knowledge of computer science and its history.","CS1 is GREAT! I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants an intro to Computer Science. It is perfect for non-concentrators and those with humanities backgrounds. It is exactly challenging enough to be fun, but not impossible to be frustrating. The lectures are pretty interesting -- Leitner is super nice. The TFs are incredibly helpful when you have questions. And the workload is totally manageable!","If you think you want to do CS but are not ready to start with CS50, this course should give you enough confidence.","Take this class to weed yourself in or out of CS 50. I found that I enjoyed CS, but not enough to kill myself in CS50","I would probably recommend CS 50 to someone who wants to be able to code very well because this class is more basic and it is pretty slow, but for people who have other difficult classes or other commitments, this is a great course for learning about computer science.","This class is difficult but really interesting. The material is useful to know and no matter what the work will get done.","This class was neither good nor bad. It is quite a bit of work but it's not necessarily hard. It might be a good step to take before taking CS50, but if you want to learn tangible skills that will allow you to be a competent programmer after 1 course, then I think going directly to CS50 would be a better idea.","Take it!","This class is a really great way to get background on CS. I had no programming or CS experience and the class felt really manageable. The problem sets are very reasonable, and there are plenty of opportunities for extra credit throughout the semester.","Awesome foundation if you are hesitant about taking CS50 or another high level course. I came in with no background and would feel confident taking another CS course at Harvard.","It's a good introductory to computer science and java programming, but don't be fooled by other posts. I had no programming experience and therefore had to take hours on pests, which were very time consuming.","This is a great way to gain an appreciation of CS without an insane workload. However, the problem sets are nonetheless time consuming, particularly if you can't make it to office hours. The course is also not fantastic at orienting you so that you know where you are in the grand scheme of the class. Nonetheless, it's still an enjoyable class!","This class is actually quite difficult. Especially for seniors who haven't taken any appreciable quantitative classes in a while, this class will be a struggle.","This is a great, stress-free CS class if you are interested in learning some basic logic that goes into programming.  It is an easy class if you have any previous experience with using loops, etc.  The assignments are not very difficult\/time consuming for the most part as long as you pay attention to lecture and understand the programming logic.  They are actually pretty fun.  \r\n\r\nThat being said, you do not learn TOO much programming in this course.  I would not consider it comprehensive enough to be considered an \"introduction to computer science\" course.  But that's fine because the aim of this course is to just expose students to CS.  If you like it, definitely take CS50 and classes beyond that.\r\n\r\nThe professor is great!!","As long as you put in the work to complete the problem sets and go to office hours, you'll do well.","Pretty low-stress class. Psets are few and far in between, with tons of extra credit points. One midterm, which was open book, and a nice support group through Piazza and the TFs. I learned a lot about CS, and though I'm probably not going to continue on with CS50, this class was great.","Hard.  But also cool at the same time.  Just take it with a friend if it is your senior spring","If you are thinking of taking this class to gain a general understanding about how CS and programming works, then you should take it; it's fun and not designed to be stressful, although the psets took a while. If you're thinking of a CS concentration, it might not be worth it -- just take CS50, even if you don't think you have enough experience. There's a much better support network.","This course is a lot of fun and Dr. Leitner will do everything possible to make sure you're on track. I am a social science concentrator who was writing a thesis while taking this course and can honestly say that there was no better way for me to (1) learn computer science basics, (2) fill the EMR requirement, and (3) take a course alongside my thesis for senior spring. Definitely take this if you're considering it. The TFs are tremendously helpful and the satisfaction you get from writing a program is like no other. Have fun!","Great class, you should take it!","Take it if you are at all interested in CS but don't want to take CS50.","If you want an easy course, here it is.","it's a great introduction to computer science and definitely a great way to find out if you're interested in taking more cs classes.","This class is deceptively challenging.  The teaching staff and porfessor provide ample support and resources, and for good reason.  For those searching for a simpler GenEd, the class is manageable without prior programming experience, however the assignments are not always intuitive.  Take advantage of the online help and the many office hours opportunities, and you will do fine.","Try to start early on psets. And get the recommended reading material. It will help if you have trouble making section or lecture. Also, lectures teach alot of the base for pests. attend and make notes of what Leitner says because it's likely to pop up in psets for extra credit.","This is a great class for anyone who has taken no CS and wants to before graduation. It made me wish I had more time here so I could take CS50 afterwards! But be warned, psets can be very frustrating if you don't have good resources (read: friends concentrating in CS) to help you out when you get stuck. Overall though, great class and highly recommend. And Professor Leitner is very nice and laid-back."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It was a good class. The problem sets get progressively harder but learned a good del about Java.","A CS course for second-semester seniors--informative but manageable with a thesis.","I really enjoyed this class! The problem sets are fun and it helps if you get an early start on them so you can get help at office hours.","This class is not super easy. In fact the psets take forever but there are only 6 of them and they count for most of your grade. I have learnt a lot from this class & I will probably take 50 having taken this class. I also now have the skill at writing a java program which I couldn't before.","Class is extremely manageable and enjoyable provided you stay on top of the material (which means attending lecture)! You will learn a very useful skill and create some things to be proud of. The teaching staff holds a ton of office hours, so it is easy to get help. This class is easy if you put in the small amount of work that is required of you; if you don't do the work, it is hard to catch up later.","takes a lot of work but i feel like i learned something valuable","Great first course in computer science, taking cs 50 and hopefully a secondary in cs thanks to this class.","This is a great introductory CS course. If you want to learn the broad material but don't want to stress about the details of java take this course pass\/fail.","A stress-free way to learn something about computer science.","If you are a second semester senior looking to take an introductory computer science course, I HIGHLY recommend taking this!","It's generally a great course- Dr. Leitner is hilarious and the psets are interesting. It was more time-consuming than I anticipated but still not super difficult.","Take this course seriously by going to classes and sections and starting psets early, especially if you're a senior thesis-writer without prior programming experience. Or take this course pass\/fail.","A perfect class to test whether or not you may enjoy going on to CS50. Easy enough that if you dislike it, you can still do very well.","Will be lost if you don't go to class so if you're committed to going to class you can crush this class.","I wish the codes were given more straight forwardly to us rather than all over the lecture notes. I also found it a little frustrating that the pset questions were much more difficult or different than what we learned in lectures. I think the lectures should be tailored for us to do well on the psets.","It is a great senior spring course.","This was one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. The depth of the material won't change your life because of its introductory nature, but learning to think about programming at its core is meaningful for any person. The course is super manageable and straightforward. It perfectly balances learning a lot with not killing yourself over work.","This class is not as easy as it is advertised! You're going to spend a fair amount of time working on each problem set. Definitely go to section and office hours.","Lectures and sections did not feel to me to be very informative. Mainly, it's a class that you must learn on your own through trial and error and lots of web searches for answers or details about Java api. You will learn some about computers but not as much as you might assume at the outset. Be prepared for some course chaos (section assignments, p-set due dates, etc).","Loved this class. A great introduction to the mode of thinking that belongs to the field of computer science. Also involves some cool knowledge regarding computing and the internet.","This class is poorly taught... The assignments are stressful and time-consuming. Surely there is something else you could take.","be prepared for some nights with a heavy workload, but you will learn very useful skills","This class was a great senior spring course and introduction to computer science. Although some of your advanced CS friends may sneer at Java, I found that it accomplished exactly what I was looking for. I simply wanted to get a basic understanding of how computers work and what programming means and looks like before I left college. By the end of the course, I was able to program a game with Java and that felt very cool.","Interesting introduction to Java and general programming. Dr. Leitner is great at generating interest in the material. The midterm is difficult, so make sure you rack up as many bonus points from problem sets as possible. Unfortunately, I do not think the lecture style of teaching is all that effective in CS. Everyone is literally just on Facebook during lecture. This class should do more to allow students to follow along on their own computers.","If you have even the smallest desire to find out what CS is about, absolutely take this class. You learn so much and the class is really designed for people with no idea what they're doing.","This class is a must-take for anyone interested in learning more about CS but not willing to commit to the level of rigor of CS50 yet. I highly recommend it for humanities concentrators and also freshmen who are unsure whether they want to explore CS further in the future. The pace is somewhat slow and very manageable (so if you already have a background in Java, don't take this class. You will be bored). The few guest lecturers are incredible and Professor Leitner is hilarious and  a great guide to introductory CS. Also, go to section (which is optional) because it's helpful, take advantage of TFs' office hours if you need it, and always do the extra credit because you never know if it might help! Overall, this class was fun and extremely practical. Because of my positive experience in this class, I'm now inclined to take CS50 in the fall.","This class gets significantly more difficult after the add\/drop deadline. Although it is much less work than CS-50, prepare to spend many, many hours getting the Java psets completed.","It was a really fun class. Not intimidating at all, and really what you should consider if CS50 seems a bit intense.","It's great for if you want to take CS50 in the fall","Take it! And take advantage of the lectures and sections.Although you can get away without going to them it's so much more worth it to go, because you will learn a lot.","This class is very straightforward and will give you an introductory appreciation of how coding works. If you're looking to learn a LOT of coding, this probably is not for you because we basically got through loops, objects, and different types of variables (especially arrays), and my understanding is that CS 50 does a lot more. If you're looking for a light elective, this fits the bill, although during weeks that a coding problem set is due (there are 6) you should expect to budget at least 4 hours to work on it.","The exam was very difficult. Even if you feel that you're doing well on the psets, it's possible to not to well on the exam","This class is a great way for non-CS people to learn some basic computer programming. It is very student-focused and, overall, a great experience.","Great class for second semester seniors","This class is a great introduction to computer science without the stress of CS50.","CS1 is a fantastic way to learn something about computers and programming without the stress of CS50. Psets are every other week for the most part, and Naomi is a great TF who will walk you through similar problems in section. Highly recommended if you have an urge to take some CS but are scared of CS50.","I thought it was a great course, I'm definitely glad I took it. I do wish, though, that I had been able to take CS50 instead. If it's spring semester and you want to start comp sci, definitely go for it. However, if it's fall, and you are trying to decide whether to take CS50 or wait for CS1, go for CS50. Assuming, that is, you want to learn how to code.","This class is so well-taught and builds on itself really naturally. Make sure you go to class and start the assignments early. You get lots of time on the assignments but actually USE the time they give you so that it doesn't pile up at the end. Section is optional but really helpful. If Naomi is still teaching always go to her section - she helps so much with  understanding the material and giving good examples that help with the problem sets. Also, some of the guest lecturers are gems. I took this senior spring and wish I had taken it earlier - loved it!","This course is good if you have no experience coding but want some before you leave.  However, the course is really easy and, as a result, can be unfulfilling especially if you have had coding experience before.  I would suggest taking this earlier rather than later, so you can see if you like coding.  Might even be a better introduction than CS50, in terms of accessibility.","Spend time with outside materials to help with the psets. Section is crucial to understanding how to do the psets. Really good skills to learn but not a cakewalk necessarily.","Take this class!  Really good introduction to CS that is pretty painless.  The class is very fair and if you go to lecture and do the problem sets you will do really well in the class.  Highly recommend for people who have zero knowledge of computer science.","You should definitely take this. It really gives you a good sense of the basic ideas of coding. after taking it, you will be able to code some basic things in Java and have a good base to code more later on. It made me want to learn more. The problem sets are hard and take time, but they're worth it","Taking this as a second-semester senior pass-fail was probably the best call of the best semester.","This is a great class to take P\/F senior spring. I looked forward to lecture each week and it was refreshing to use my brain in a different way (all my other classes are writing\/reading classes). While some of the p-set questions were challenging, the teaching staff are amazingly supportive and always willing to help, either through the online forum or in person. I think that lecture can help you stay on track but it's not totally necessary to attend, since most of my learning took place in section or using online resources.","Great class for senior spring but more work than expected - first two problem sets were very easy, so make sure you do all of the homework and extra credit on them for later problem sets!","Pretty low workload, but the assignments do get relatively difficult.","This is a fantastic senior spring course. You will learn worthwhile, interesting, highly applicable computer skills and you won't be particularly stressed while doing it. If you don't want to go through the torture that is CS 50, take this class instead!","This is a great way to learn about computer science without having too much homework or work. I feel like I learned a lot, but I never felt overwhelmed. Also, the Piazza discussion component was helpful.","This class is great for everyone, especially second semester seniors or people with no background in computer science. I had a lot of fun in this class, took it as an elective, and was writing my thesis at the same time, and I found the workload to be totally manageable and actually very fun. I learned a lot from it and really loved all of the problem sets! There's also plenty of access to help through TFs and friends who have taken CS50.","This is definitely not an easy senior spring class. The psets take hours and you will likely have to learn the material to do the psets from section or office hours (lecture material is pretty unhelpful to actually completing pset problems). That being said, this class teaches you how to think logically and gives you a basic background if you're at all interested in CS. If you're looking for an easy elective and not super interested in CS, I wouldn't take this class.","This is a great course to get an introduction to computer science, particularly if you only have room for such a course in the spring. I feel confident that I would be able to learn more programming skills independently after learning the framework from Professor Leitner. I wish I had more time at Harvard to take CS classes (I'm a senior.)","CS1 is a good elective for senior spring- it is pretty low on work and difficulty, but it is still interesting and you can learn a new skill!","I LOVED this class. It's perfect if you just want an introduction to programming but don't want to have it move at the lightning fast pace or do a ton of hours of work per week then definitely take this. I took it senior spring and it was easy enough, but I still learned a ton and I can write some java code now. I had a ton of fun with my final project (wrote a program that allows people to play a casino game). awesome awesome class. take it","If you haven't programmed before, take this pass\/fail!! Also find a buddy to do problem sets with and go to office hours."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"122","response rate":"77.87","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 1","course_id":"1221","cat_num":"6903","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"21","4s":"42","5s":"24"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 1","course_id":"1221","cat_num":"6903","1s":"3","2s":"23","3s":"43","4s":"22","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 1","course_id":"1221","cat_num":"6903","1s":"11","2s":"52","3s":"23","4s":"6","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
