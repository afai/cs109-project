I learned a lot and had a great time. The field trips were very fun, and since the class size was small, we all formed a nice community. Professor Cavanaugh is very, very nice and caring, and she makes sure you understand what is being taught. She also had snacks for us, all the time\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpizza, guac, chips, celery\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand used a lot of didactic materials that were fun to observe and use!","It is very fun, not stressful, and incredibly interesting.  Dr. Cavanaugh is a joy to learn from, not to mention a brilliant scientist, and you will learn a lot from the readings, lectures, and just being around her!","You will enjoy this class if you are interested in essentially any field of biology and have some innate curiosity about how life works.","Professor Cavanaugh is an amazing teacher and really, really cares about the material she teaches and her students.  I am so glad she was able to start this freshman seminar.  I was already interested in the material to begin with, but I have delved more into symbioses and learned more about these relationships in an incredibly fun way.  \nProfessor Cavanaugh is incredibly accomplished in her field, and she truly enjoys what she teaches- it comes through in the class.  She incorporates fun trips and interesting talks into the curriculum as well.","Choosing to take this course was perhaps the best decision when it came to deciding to take a seminar. It was fun (especially the field trips to the BHI, Aquarium, and Broad Institute), informative, and engaging. Perhaps most importantly it introduced me to some of my closest friends on campus and through this course I got to know one of the most intelligent and friendly professors on campus.","Professor Cavanaugh is incredible- extremely personable, helpful, and intelligent. By far my favorite and most rewarding class of freshman fall. Large amounts of reading concerning microbial symbioses so a interest in the subject material is necessary. Her enthusiasm with the subject material has influenced my thoughts on future career path in science.","If you are looking for an interesting seminar with an amazing professor, this is it! Professor Cavanaugh is great, and will teach you a lot about microbiology!","Definitely take this course! Professor Cavanaugh is so enthusiastic about this course. She has done so much, you'll be amazed. Like, the day after our papers were do, she was going to the White House for a meeting...like how crazy is that! She makes class fun, but definitely make sure you do all the readings and take notes...that's what the basis of the class discussions are on, and since class only meets once a week, you don't wanna be left out.","Awesome seminar, awesome professor! If you have an interest in biology, I would definitely recommend it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 24q","course_id":"11445","cat_num":"32855","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 24q","course_id":"11445","cat_num":"32855","1s":"3","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
