This course also gives you a good understanding of Mathematica, and requires little to no out-of-class work.","The course material was cool, but the class was frustratingly disorganized.","Good class to round out a heavy workload. I definitely had more fun in this class than in any of my other courses. It can be disorganized at times, so you must take the initiative to keep your own work organized or it will come back to haunt you later in the course when you need content from increasingly many files."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"1.30","difficulty":"1.50","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"10","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 140r","course_id":"10724","cat_num":"30645","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APMTH 140r","course_id":"10724","cat_num":"30645","1s":"4","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 140r","course_id":"10724","cat_num":"30645","1s":"5","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
