'08":{"comments":["This course should be closed to students in the PhD program in Health Policy, since we learn a lot about how to approach the program as students and post-graduation.","Core is really more than a class- it's a defining part of the first-year health policy experience. I found that it was incredibly stimulating, and at times very intellectually demanding. Be prepared to speak up, and don't hesitate to seek out the TF and faculty outside of class."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["It's a challenging but rewarding class!","A lot of topics are coverred but there are some holes in the areas studied","Read Health Affairs.  Take good notes or you many not remember what the main points were later on.","You will get out of this course what you put into it - completing the reading is helpful to participating in the discussions.","Great preparation for generals."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Excellent course overall, though some lecturers are stronger and more engaging than others."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["It is a great introduction to Health Policy issues (with a focus on U.S. health policy issues), but definitely more of a lecture-based seminar rather than a discussion-based course.","It's great to meet professors.  Try to do the readings even though you can get by without them."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This is an excellent survey course for students interested in health services research. I took away several new research ideas from the first semester's material.","I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and wish the G-2s had a comparable course! A fantastic overview of health policy issues with lively discussion.","Not that you have much choice, but this is a great course and provides a very comprehensive perspective on (the interdiscipline of) health policy. Be ready to participate!","-Ask many questions of the professors when they lacture -- they are experts in their fields and have important insights!"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is a \"greatest hits\" approach to health policy and has the advantages and disadvantages of any survey course.  I would not advise people who are not in the health policy PhD program to take this course.  Instead take one of the Health Econ courses with Cutler or Chernew.  If your interests are in developing countries, the global health section was particularly incoherent and shallow.","Engage and participate!","This is a great foundational class, though it may not cover all topics of interest.  Additionally, to anyone outside of the HP program, much of it may not be applicable.","This course is intended for the Health Policy PhD students and serves as an excellent shared experience and knowledge base for the rest of graduate school."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["You'll only learn as much as you put into this course!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Do the readings and ask a lot of questions!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Be prepared for a very uneven course. For everyone, some sessions will be exciting and some will definitely not be."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["An excellent course that requires a lot of reading but provides an interdisciplinary overview of contemporary issues in health policy.","This is a great opportunity for bonding with the cohort and getting a sense of the current issues are in health policy. It is very broad, though, so it's important to remember what you're here to study and not get pulled in too many directions."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a great course in the health policy program and a valuable resource in the process towards understanding issues and strengths in the american health system.","Come prepared to class. The more you've prepared the more of a discussion you'll have, which enhances the traditional lecture-based format."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"5.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"13","response rate":"38.46","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HLTHPOL 2000","course_id":"2309","cat_num":"4522","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HLTHPOL 2000","course_id":"2309","cat_num":"4522","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HLTHPOL 2000","course_id":"2309","cat_num":"4522","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
