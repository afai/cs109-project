you.","It is a lot of work, but can be very fulfilling; by the end of the course, one really feels like they are prepared to begin to converse with native Chinese speakers.","It's a lot of hard work, but your Chinese will definitely improve and you may learn many interesting things from the book.  The teachers are all absolute sweet-hearts; they want to help you and all are fun people to work with.","This class requires a lot of time, but if you are interested in learning the language, the teachers do a great job of trying to cover interesting topic and keep you involved.","It's too difficult - do not take.","Be prepared for massive numbers of assignments, most of which are of no benefit to you.","be prepared to put in a lot of work","You will gain out of it what you put into it, but it will probably be a lot!","I would highly recommend that students continue their study of Chinese.  I improved greatly this year, and the course was a lot of fun.","It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful! Enjoy! Practice speaking Chinese as much as you can, and NEVER speak English in class. Discipline yourself. Also, make sure and pay attention to the cultural topics we study (Chinese medicine, Beijing opera, idioms, etc.); they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fascinating, and they also play a major role on the exams. Also, I highly recommend you attend the Harvard-Beijing Academy next summer to reinforce what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning; it will prove immensely helpful in developing your Chinese fluency and comprehension.","You need to be prepared to work hard, and to learn a LOT of \r\nChinese!","Only take it if related to concentration or language citation.","be ready to work hard!  you learn a lot, the teachers are sometimes a little demanding and unforgiving, though, but they are excellent.","A class with great, passionate teachers that you'll never, ever feel you studied enough for!  Pretty hard to take this class as just another class.  And it's important to be realistic about expectations.  In the end, you have to go to China for an extended period to really learn Chinese.  But this is surely the best preparation you can have ahead of that.","The course is challenging but extremely well-instructed, and is worth every minute","Extremely difficult! A huge step up from the 120a and 120b workload with worse teaching."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["be prepared to work hard","be ready to work","Go to China if you want to learn Chinese!","If you are willing to put in the time, this class can be very rewarding, but it can just as easily slip away from you if you fail to take it seriously.","This class takes quite a bit of work, but if you've made it through two years of Chinese already then you are probably the type of person who would enjoy it.  I know I did.","I had some doubts about picking up Chinese again, but this course has proved to be one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard so far. Take it - you won't regret it.","Not as fun as previous years, grading is much harder and personalized attention is lacking.","It's not as fun as first year Chinese, but it is still a good Chinese course.","This class is somewhat harder (or at least harder to do well in!) than Chinese 120, but it is a very solid Chinese course, and very worthwhile to take.","Study well, do not worry so much about vocabulary as proper grammar usage. Ensure that you have a way to practice speaking on a regular basis. It will help you immensely.","Be prepared to do hard work in writing and not enough practice of your speaking","You can get by in this class without knowing very much, but if you take advantage of it, you can learn a lot. It depends on how interested you are in actually speaking Chinese.","confidence in speaking and writing Chinese increases immensely in a single semester."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["The class is a lot of fun.","As every Chinese course, 130 is well taught and very fun. If you are hesitating between staying at the 120 level or moving on, I definitely encourage you to take it because it will really help you develop your formal Chinese and teach you how to adapt your vocabulary to a situation. You also get to learn a lot more than in previous courses about Chinese culture and society.","Really make sure to engage in drill section--it makes it so much fun when you have a great class like I had this semester.","Harvard is a great place to learn foreign languages!","Hopefully you know the drill by now. If you can bei shengci every week and get your homework done on a weekly basis, then you'll have no surprises here. As a side note, completing HBA for 120 makes this class substantially easier.","If you haven't been to HBA it's a little difficult, but still isn't much harder than 120.","The class is useful, but you have to make it so. And hour each day isn't enough for conversant Chinese - go to office hours, talk to the teachers, do the readings, put effort into the essays, and you'll come away with a lot.","This course is great!  It has been my favorite semester of Chinese so far and you will really start to feel like you can express your thoughts in Chinese.  Yan laoshi is very kind and patient and does an excellent job of making the course relevant.  Li laoshi is a badass.  She is the coolest.  Pray that you will have her.","the teachers are great, you learn a lot, the workload isn't too bad.","The many assignments can seem tedious, but it helps learn the language and makes you practice every day.","If you take 123xb before this, this will be easier and nicer than last year. But you definitely learn a lot still and have some fun too!","I loved this class. If you want to put in the work, it is so worth it!","I mean, if you like Chinese it's your only option. Possibly don't expect to enjoy it as much as first or second year...","I'd \"recommend this course with enthusiasm\" if you have a really good reason for learning advanced Chinese. Otherwise, it takes up a lot of time and energy.","Chinese 130a is a great course. It is more challenging than 120b. If you have been to China before and learned Chinese through being in China, it is a bit of a disappointment because the pedagogy is just different in comparison to learning in the natural environment. This was a tougher part to get used to. Be prepared to learn more characters than in years past but you will really see your Chinese improve if you put in the extra work.","It is a lot of work, but worth it.  Your language abilities will progress tremendously.  Try to keep your tones!","it's much easier than the heritage track","Third year is definitely more work than second year, but the movies and clips we watch or more fun.","130 is a lot more difficult than 120.","This class meets every day, so be prepared to work on Chinese every day of the week.  There is no down time, but that is the best way to actually improve in a language.","Third year is much harder than the previous two years.","Overall it was a good course! But I feel that my Chinese has not improved that much... it might also be because I took second year Chinese over the summer at HBA and improved my Chinese by a lot. So now that I am no longer immersed in the language... I feel that my learning speed has slowed down. Which it has. But it is still a good course.","The teachers in this course were particularly helpful and even assisted me with assignments for other courses that required Chinese.","If you are interested at all in furthering your Chinese skills, this is an excellent course to take. It makes the transition from colloquial to formal Chinese very smooth, and in addition, you get to learn about many interesting facets of Chinese culture, such as Beijing Opera. All the teachers are extremely nice, patient, and qualified, so definitely take it!","Chinese 130a is interesting and really delves deeper into the Chinese language than you may have been used to in high school, but be ready to devote a lot of study time to memorizing the characters and sentence patterns, as class meets every day.","Be prepared to work very hard, but the gains you make in your language skills will be concrete and rapid.","hard but you get out what you put in. worth it."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Definitely a step up memorization-wise from Chinese Ba\/b and the 120s, and I think you start learning more and more words that are more situation specific (i.e. you may not necessarily use them in daily conversation...) but as usual, you're surrounded by excellent teachers who'll definitely be there to help.","Section was wonderful, as the teaching staff was clearly very dedicated. However, the reading material for the course was at times uninteresting, and lectures did not necessarily provide new insight into the written materials.","Second year Chinese vocabulary at Harvard was pretty hard. The third year's vocabulary is not as hard, so do not give up!","The course is somewhat of a review of Chinese 120, with further vocabulary and grammatical structures.","Great course, but be prepared to spend a lot of time.","Do it...it's fun!","Chinese 130a was my favorite course this semester. The subject matter is interesting, and the teachers are some of the best instructors I have ever had. It is really not that much work.","Such a fun course! Great teachers!","I have heard that all of the language departments are strong at Harvard, and I am sure this is true. However, I have never seen students progress at a faster speed than in the Chinese language department. All of the faculty are wonderful, kind, and helpful. Each level of Chinese I have taken at Harvard has been excellent, and 130a was no exception. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to continue their study of Chinese language. It has helped me immensely.","Lots of work but everyone is super supportive! You'll be able to tell a difference by the time you're done!","This course in amazing! The formal\/classical Chinese can be difficult (chapter 8!) but the rest is fine. If you have taken HBA, this course shouldn't be too bad in terms of workload and difficulty.","This class is amazing! Chinese 120 does a good job of preparing you for Chinese 130, and I really think you will all actually be able to focus on the content of the class, instead of worrying about memorizing everything.","The Chinese 130a teachers are amazing and really want to make sure each student learns the material.  If you put in the time and do the weekly tingxies and homework assignments, they recognize that and the grading isn't too difficult.  If you're interested in taking your Chinese learning to the next level (with a particular emphasis on the difference between formal and informal in both speech and writing), then this course is for you.","You  will learn a lot of Chinese, more involved work is required","As all Chinese classes at Harvard, this course requires a lot of time. If you're willing to put in the work, though, it is very rewarding.","This course might be a lot of work, but you learn soooooo much, so I really recommend it as long as you are up to working a lot.","Yan Laoshi is amazing. Take this.","A great way to dramatically improve your Chinese with amazing, dedicated and super-friendly teachers.","Simply put, if you are interested in learning Chinese, Harvard has an amazing program for it.","This Chinese course is far from the stress overload you might expect from a course in such a difficult language. Still there's a lot of work--it's a well-rounded approach to the language that moves at a fast yet comfortable clip. After one year in of Chinese here (120), I came into this course expecting it to meet a high bar, and it definitely did. Great, hardworking section leaders and a great course head have me looking forward to 130b.","Yan laoshi is a beast. Great material. Useful vocab and grammar.","it is fun","Great way to cement the language proficiency you've developed with past years of Chinese study.","Great continuation of learning Chinese. It will be a bit easy after HBA, though, as there will be a lot of stuff you've already learned before. The teachers are awesome.","Taking Chinese is the best academic experience I've had at Harvard. It's extremely hard but extremely fun.  And you won't find a friendlier, more accessible teaching staff at Harvard.  Keep at it!","you will spend HOURS working for this, but you will learn a lot","Engage in lecture and section and your Chinese is guaranteed to improve!","Chinese is a fairly large amount of work, but the course professors are incredibly sweet and helpful. I was not a great fan of language classes in high school, but I am so glad I tried it out for at leas one semester in college - I am now planning to do a citation!","Take this class. It's so worth it to keep developing your language skills, and the teaching staff will literally do everything they can to help you.","The Chinese teachers are so enthusiastic, accessible and make learning this daunting language doable and fun. The class is run so well and you get constant feedback. Highly recommend."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It is a good class and I learned a lot, but it is very time-intensive and the vocabulary lists can be overwhelming.","The class is enjoyable if you have an intuitive understanding of Chinese, but like in any Chinese class you may struggle if you treat it as a memorization course.","This is a good Chinese course. You will absolutely improve throughout the course of the semester! Hu Laoshi is really great, as are all of the TFs.","You have to love Chinese, learn quickly, and be willing to put in a lot of time. The profs are wonderful.","The class is a good transition from Chinese 120. I definitely feel more comfortable with speaking and reading Chinese after taking this course, especially formal Chinese.","Fun course with very kind grading from the teachers. Be careful though, even if you've taken Chinese for two years already, this course may require some more preparation.","it's a well-administered class with a strong curriculum. do the work, and you'll find it very rewarding.","I feel like my improvement wasn't nearly as drastic as after 120a, but it's still a great course, and learning chengyu and suyu is difficult and a little weird, but great for tigao-ing your zhongwen shuiping.","You've already taken 2 years of Chinese so......take 130a too!! It's an awesome, fun, extremely well organized class during which you will learn a ton of Chinese. Finish up the last year of your citation (if that's what you're going for) and enjoy it while you do!","Hu laoshi's teaching style is a lot more repetition and rote-memorization based, but the course overall is very engaging and rewarding. The class is a lot tougher than 120 even just in the scope of the assignments, but the passionate teaching staff makes this course truly wonderful.","Good solid foundation on your Chinese. 140 might be unnecessary","This class is similar to all the other Chinese courses, but I actually found it more manageable. We didn't move outrageously fast through the material, and the tests were fair and straightforward. I really feel more confident in my Chinese now! Also Hu Laoshi is really laid back and a great teacher. The section leaders are also great.","Pros: The teachers are amazing. Besides being incredibly well organized, they are energetic, enthusiastic, and excited about the course material. They will correct you on tones, which is important. Exams and homework are fair, because the staff really does want everyone to learn Chinese. \r\nCons: Sometimes the class feels like reciting and memorizing grammar structures instead of making your own sentences. Also, you can get away with not saying a lot in section, which only hurts in the long run. There aren't as many opportunities to speak in class than there should be.","Be prepared to do a lot of work, but it's very rewarding and you gain a very solid basis!","If you're an incoming freshman, the beginning may be a little rocky until you fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Early on you'll frequently be pulling up vocab words in your head that aren't matching what many of your classmates have learned in the past two years. That goes away by the first midterm though, so just soldier on and your grade will be surprisingly fine given how quickly your Chinese will have improved.","This is the class you'll be excited to go to and forget where the time went when it ends! You'll laugh a lot and learn a lot! Good for the mind and soul! Take Chinese!!!! :)","This course is the logical next choice after 120b. It focuses a lot more on formal written Chinese which can become very frustrating at times - especially with all the cheng yu. However, it still has a good balance of spoken language.","This is a great class; it's a lot of work but it's also very manageable and enjoyable. The teaching staff is amazing and extremely helpful.","If you just stay on top of the regular work this course is not that hard and you will learn a lot. :)","The pace of the class is extremely fast. Be prepared to learn a lot, but also be prepared to put in a lot of time.","A solid third-year course in Chinese; there's a fair amount of review, but also a lot of new characters--some days the dictations were overwhelming! On the whole, though, it's very easy to do well in the course if you put in a little time every day.","The teachers are incredibly understanding and very helpful.","Be prepared to put in a lot of time and work, but it's very rewarding .","The text is pretty funny. The teaching fellows and head teacher are hilarious people and overall, I found it very enjoyable. I would say it is not as good as Ba but it is still good.","Great class. Requires a lot of work on your own, but really saw improvement in my Chinese this semester","Take this class if you're willing to work and it is important to you.","The staff is really great. They are all very talented, dedicated, and understanding. However, this course is deeply flawed and hard to recommend to anyone. It feels like a total waste of time to be learning such formal language, a lot of which is vocabulary that you will simply never use in conversation. Also, there needs to be more speaking opportunity. The focus is almost entirely on reading and writing, which is just not nearly as important in learning or using a new language - especially in Chinese, where it's unbearably rote. What's more, the actual in-class speaking opportunity is almost nonexistent, so there's pretty much no opportunity to practice the vocab and \"grammar\" being taught (not that you even would use it in conversation, since it's so formal and unnatural). Another fundamental flaw is that the people coming into this class are from all different levels, many of whom can hardly carry a Chinese conversation. If you're coming out of HBA, you'll be seriously frustrated and feel like you're wasting your time with the subject matter and getting nothing done. My Chinese level definitely regressed over the semester. Take 142 Conversational Chinese instead, unless for some reason you're absolutely intent on learning formal Chinese and focusing almost entirely on characters.","Hu Laoshi is one of the best teachers you will likely ever have.","Amazing class to take. As with all Chinese classes, it takes a tremendous amount of work. But the class is extremely fulfilling. Professor Hu and the TFs are all extremely enthusiastic and make it a fun time in Vanserg. Highly recommend taking the course to expand Chinese knowledge and development.","Chinese is always really challenging because of the daily workload. But the teaching staff is the best at Harvard and the class is extremely rewarding overall.","This is a great course. The Chinese department is incredibly dedicated and approachable and all of the teachers are wonderful! The course material is relevant and interesting. If you took 120 at HBA, it can be somewhat repetitive and slow-moving which is occasionally frustrating but it is still a good course.","A well taught class. Maybe it was just a result of the smaller class size, but I felt compared to 120a\/b this course was a bit better organized and more attentive to the individual. Be prepared for lots of testing.","It's not too difficult, work is balanced throughout the term - except for reading period - andyou learn useful things very well."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Lots of work, but well worth it. Keep on top of the work!","DO IT.","stay on top of your assignments","The vocabulary is pretty hard. But the course and instructors are fantastic. People who came straight to Chinese 130 rather than after Ba Bb 120a 120b seemed to struggle a little in the beginning because the teachers here focused a lot on tones in Ba Bb 120a 120b.","If you've already done 120, there's no reason not to take this class! The grammar is a bit more complicated and the texts are a bit more in-depth but all-in-all it's a very natural transition from 120. Take it!","This class is a great continuation of chinese studies","This class is great.  Boring but you learn Chinese.","Be prepared to work hard + learn a lot!","If you've taken Chinese before at Harvard, you know what you're in for - a fantastic class in basically every way. While harder than 120, it's not an unreasonable step-up - if you had a good grasp of the 120 material, the only thing you really have to work hard on and might present a challenge is speaking and listening skills.","Once again, the Chinese department at Harvard proves it is one of the best departments at the school. If you're taking 130, by now you should know exactly what to expect from Chinese at Harvard: the teachers are excellent, the assignments are difficult and plentiful but never overwhelming, and the tingxies are tingxies.","Chinese 130a is an incredible class. We learn so much new vocabulary and grammar in just a semester and develop an enriched understanding of the issues facing contemporary China.","This is a great course if you're looking to expand upon your Chinese speaking and reading skills. It has a similar format to Chinese 120 and consists of a lot of vocabulary and grammar memorization, but it is helpful if you want to pursue learning Mandarin. It is not an overly rigorous course and not the best if you're looking to only focus on oral skills.","Great course, especially drill section. Similar to the other Chinese courses before it, except Hu Laoshi is the bomb (and he helps you during dictations). It wasn't so hard for me once I got into a good routine, and I felt it was a nice break from doing readings or psets from other classes.","There's a fair amount of work to this class, but it is well rewarded: you will come out with a much better grasp of Chinese reading and writing. This course has been another great semester in Harvard's amazing Chinese language program; I have taken a Chinese class every semester I've been here, and it's always been one of my best-taught and favorite courses every semester.","You should be willing to put in consistent amount of work throughout the semester. As long as you stay on top of everything, this course won't be difficult at all.","It's a class that took a lot of my time but I was always happy to go to class and drill sections, which says a lot compared to most of my other classes.","Language is a skill you won't regret learning, and here you can learn it without it being a pain (you'll enjoy it!).","Chinese 130a is a very enjoyable and manageable class. It's not hard but you have to put time into studying for tests and tingxie. The teachers are great!","I love the laoshis! It was always such a lovely way to start the day, even if Vanserg is in the middle of nowhere.","The class will teach you the Chinese you want to know.  However, be warned: this class takes up an extraordinary amount of time (just like most language classes, but especially with Asian languages).  I took this course (and 120b) with a five class schedule, and it was absolute hell in terms of workload.  But the class is effective, so that made up for the pressure.  If you want to take 130 (or any Chinese class), don't load up on courses.","You need to put in consistent effort to make it worthwhile (which the teachers do a good job of making sure\/encouraging you do)","Chinese 130a is absolutely a worthwhile class! More so than ever before, it focuses on topics that are extremely relevant, interesting, timely, and even a little controversial. You'll learn to discuss issues like Chinese economic issues, pollution and ways to reduce it, marriage and dating, food safety, copyright infringement disputes, etc. The grammar points are very well taught and well structured. Of course, most importantly, the teaching staff of this class are all absolutely phenomenal, some of the most friendly, accessible, talented, and helpful teachers you'll find in the Chinese department!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"7.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"49","response rate":"93.88","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE 130a","course_id":"765","cat_num":"6724","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"18","5s":"25"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE 130a","course_id":"765","cat_num":"6724","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"26","4s":"15","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE 130a","course_id":"765","cat_num":"6724","1s":"0","2s":"24","3s":"10","4s":"4","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
