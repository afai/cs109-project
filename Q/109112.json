I hadn't considered the business of drug development something I would be interested in pursuing as a career, but after how much I enjoyed this class I might just have to change that. Well-designed course as well--perfect mix of exams, papers, projects, and problem sets (not too much of any one thing!). I felt like I learned something from each assignment and the final project gave me the chance to delve deep down into a topic I was interested in. Definitely a good pick!","This is perhaps one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is intellectually challenging but totally worth it. We learn some amazing things and hear from huge people in the industry. If you are curious about the pharmaceutical industry, TAKE THIS CLASS!","This class was very enjoyable and showed another side of the health sector that isn't emphasized as much.  The lectures from scientists and executives at various pharmaceutical companies were always interesting and very informative.  The course itself wasn't too difficult if you paid attention in lecture and did the section readings, but the midterm was a little tricky because there's only one problem set before it, so it's hard to know how exactly to prepare.  Aside from that though, the rest of the course was done well, and I recommend it for anyone with any interest in how drugs are developed and marketed.","It's a very interesting class and you get to hear from the leaders in drug discovery, but it's also a rather difficult class. The problem sets reach beyond what is covered in class and you don't get a lot of time on the exam.","This is a great course with leading professors. You'll enjoy it. The workload is not difficult to manage. If you're on the fence, take it.","The teaching staff are all very knowledgeable, and this course is definitely worth taking."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"12","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null}},"success":true}
