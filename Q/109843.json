The period was such an interesting time for the development of science and technology in the US and USSR, ensuring that you learn something new every lecture. Like most hist sci classes however, the class really boils down to just reading a new wikipedia page every week. If you want an easy A go ahead and take this course but if you are looking for something more substantive to round out your schedule and add to your Harvard experience, I'd give this one a pass.","one of the best courses I've taken at H","It is certainly worth taking, especially if you're interested in the historical context of science in an era of unprecedented growth. I wouldn't recommend it to those outside of the concentration.","If you're a histsci concentrator, I would highly recommend this course!!","Very good course.  You want to take it","A thorough survey to the Cold War history","This is an amazing class. Nuclear weapons, spies, and a lot of \"cool\" technology is a prominent feature of the course. The Cold War is just a really neat time period, and Dr. Baldwin does an amazing job.","Such an incredible course! Dr. B is so insightful and caring. She was always willing to meet me outside of her office hours and provided me with great, thorough feedback even on reading response papers. I'm not a history of science concentrator, but I found this course accessible and enjoyable. I don't know when\/if this course will be offered in the future, but you should definitely take this course (or any course taught by Dr. B) if you have the chance.","The lectures were the highlight of this course. I think the readings\/sections were weakest, but since it is a new course, can be ironed out in the future. The professor is an engaging lecturer, and although as it turns out, a lot of the science of the Cold War did not interest me (a lot about academia), the lectures were always very well done. Section was often lackluster in terms of discussion, and often the readings were dry and left little room for great or creative discussions.","Absolutely!","This an amazing course for any Harvard student. Professor Baldwin gives clear, organized lectures and the readings and assignments are pretty manageable. It's definitely not a pushover class as there are quite a few assignments, but the feedback is great and it's fairly graded. Also section is amazing. You'll come away with a deeper understanding of the Cold War and of science in general. Great class, highly recommend.","Loved everything about it! So interesting, great instructor, great materials and topics. Assignments are also interesting (the blog posts) and studying was more interesting than difficult and was almost enjoyable (first time I've said that about a class in awhile)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"24","response rate":"83.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 122v","course_id":"10989","cat_num":"80044","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"9","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 122v","course_id":"10989","cat_num":"80044","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"13","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 122v","course_id":"10989","cat_num":"80044","1s":"5","2s":"9","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
