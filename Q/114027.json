Plus, this class was pretty easy.","One of those very rare well-taught, well-organized, no bull-shit classes at Harvard where problem sets and exams are very fair.","Exams aren't as easy as people tell you they are.","If you need to learn basic statistics, this is the class to take.","This is a solid course that, if you stay on top of your material in, you will do well in.  More importantly, this course will teach you how to evaluate the statistics presented in the media in everyday situations with a discerning eye, thus making you a more educated citizen.","This class is great, whether you're interested in economics or medicine or whatever, the class is incredibly practical.","It's an easy class and you learn things that are useful for life!","Do the problem sets and make sure you stay up date with the material because it will help tremendously down the road.","Great class for statistics!","This class is HARD","This is a great class to take because it teaches you useful tools required in  academia. It makes you a better informed and more critical citizen of the world.","Take statistics only if you need it for a concentration or research.","The material is interesting, well-taught, and the professor cares.","I would still recommend this class to economics concentrators, over Stat 100. The professor is very knowledgeable and indeed, you learn much about Statistics.","it's not an easy course but it can be a rewarding learning experience. understand your limitations and if you think you're comfortable with math, take it.","This course may be tedious at times (hey, it's statistics), but Professor Stanley injects real world applications that make the statistics interesting and the outcomes the important part.","This class was a painless way of fulfilling the statistics requirements for most concentrations. The final individual project is a lot easier and less time consuming than the poster project for Stat 100.","Ken Stanley rocks.","As long as you keep up with the lecture notes and give yourself enough time for the problem sets, this class is very easy.","This class provides a solid grounding in statistics","The problem sets involve some work, but the course is superbly-taught.","Statistics is very boring, so most classes in it will be boring","Ken is a great teacher. It may be a harder course than Stat 100, but the professors really make the class!","If you have to take a Statistics course, this is a good choice. It's a little dry to recommend as an elective, but still. It's very good stuff to know, and feels very useful.","Very manageable class.

If you're like me, you won't have to work much, but you won't like it much either.","Stat 104 is the best of the intro Stat course because it has the best TFs. Lecture can be a bit dry and often confusing if you daze off, but you don't always have to go (or ever really) as the lecture slides (9 out of 10 times) are the lecture and are always available online. Section is optional but I feel that you could learn the course from section alone (If you go to Kevin Rader's section). It is however, a class you should take as many other classes include readings with mentions of statistical analysis which make much much much more sense after taking this class. Also the mid-term and final have a mean of a B....its not that hard. Especially if you are any sort of a math person take it, it will be easy. I mean, you get a cheat sheet on the midterm and final!","Great lectures. GO TO SECTIONS. don't expect too many examples with economic data.","Useful class for economics majors","Make sure you attend all the lectures, particularly if that is useful to your learning style. If you have a good section, attend. Don't be fooled by how easy the first few weeks are; the material becomes much more complex as time goes on.","It is very helpful in learning basic statistics, but the problem sets can become overwhelming at the end.","it's a really good first stats course","Go to lecture and the student network sessions.","Although it may seem boring, it's actually pretty useful and interesting.","You really get a great overview of statistical methods.","great class. Ken Stanley does an incredible job taking a boring topic and making it at least somewhat interesting. He knows his stuff and is always willing to help. no reading necessary, just a weekly problem set.","Really will prepare you to do statistics.","I took this for the Ec requirement, but it's definitely the most useful and practical math class I've taken.","Reasons to take this class:\r\n1. You learned statistics really well\r\n2. The class is pretty easy- since a lot of the smart people are in stat 110 it is really easy to beat the average compared to every other science\/ math class I've taken\r\n3. Tests are straight-forward. There are no frustrating surprises that you have not seen before like in most science\/ math classes.  Practice tests resemble the real test's format exactly, so you always know what to study.\r\n4. You can show up to any section you want no matter who you were assigned.  Although I was assigned a section leader that did not speak English, I attended another section that was AMAZING (Go to Kevin's section if he still teaches).  As a junior natural science concentrator, I would say Kevin was the best science or math section leader I have ever had.\r\n5. There is no calculus or other advanced math involved.  Calculus is scary.\r\n\r\nReasons not to take it:\r\n1. Weekly problem sets can seem long (3-5 hours) if you procrastinate (BUT, they teach you the material very well, so they should not be changed)\r\n2. If you can't do basic algebra you will have trouble.\r\n\r\nJust take it.  This class has the most practical use out of any class I have ever taken.","Simple, direct, and useful.  Hits a wide range of basic statistical techniques, and does so clearly.","Go to section. It is one of the most helpful parts of this class. Ignore the optional part of the sections and just go. If you haven't taken stat before they are almost absolutely necessary to understanding the material.","It's a good course. Start problem sets ahead of time.","some people like it... but if you havent taken stats before... it's really hard, and theres not that much support.","This class is very useful and teaches a variety of techniques and their applications. Probably one of the most practical classes you will take at Harvard. It's relatively painless, too, so there's really no reason not to take it.","this is one of the best classes and most useful classes I have taken at Harvard.","This is the rare class that is both very useful and very easy.","Interesting introductory course.  Good TF is key, because Professor Stanley's style is not for everybody.","Its a big class, but the professor is great the problem sets force you to learn the material. you can do well if you put in the time and if you're good at math (like if you've taken 21a) you are capable of getting an A. take it if you want a background in stats, which is pretty essential in many disciplines.","Its easy. I didn't find lecture or section that useful (I didn't attend too much) but I did learn statistics in a fairly low-pressure format that's good for non-mathy types.","This course gives valuable insight into the use and calculation of statistics, but for the passing interest it goes a little more in depth than necessary and seems to assume that everyone in the class is going to move on to do deeper statistical analyses.","This class is absolutely essential for anyone who wants to understand the world around them.  It allows you to analyze data yourself instead of taking the word of someone else.  It is also a great class for anyone who plans to do any type of research.","Anyone who is looking for an introduction to statistics, you'll get a very well-taught and thorough course here.  If you've had AP Stats in high school, you may consider skipping it though.","If you are looking for a great, straight-forward intro stats course, this is it.","An excellent introduction to statistics. Prof. Stanley is a great lecturer and very friendly and accessible outside of class. Try to get Dennis or Kevin for your TF.","Good, solid class. Useful and dependable.","The problem sets are tedious but you learn a lot and it's not difficult!! Some of the TFs are difficult to understand (in terms of English speaking skills) but mine was great!","This course was a great way to get an in depth introduction to statistics and their application","Stat 104 is a useful introductory course. Be sure to leave enough time to do all the problem sets early, ahead of time.","If this is your first experience with statistics, take the Stat 100 or Stat 101 class which covers much of the same information at a supposedly easier level.","Statistics is so useful and this class gives you the most useful bits that you can get and understand in one semester. If you only have one semester that you can dedicate to a stat course, take this one.","Not something you would want to take out of pure interest but definitely not a requirement that you need to dread either","Interesting, not too difficult, but lots of tedious busywork.","Although the problem sets are time-consuming, I really liked the professor and the application of statistics.","Its a lot of work, but its the best basic statistic class out there. Kenneth Stanley reminds me of a statistical Santa Claus.","If you don't understand something then get help early because the topics build upon each other.","Its deceptively difficult but very doable","The course was valuable, but time consuming.","This is a great way to become familiar with statistics.","A good option to take for a requirement, much more informative than stats 100","No one should leave harvard without taking one statistical course. Professor Stanley was great so I'd recommend 104 over other courses.","Good class, you probably have to take it for ec, it's not too bad.  Prof. and staff and helpful.","good intro to statistics, especially if you are interested in Economics.","It's boring but really useful.","I shopped Stat 101 and Stat 100 as well.  This was by far the best and had the most interesting professor.","The cheatsheets are amazing. Just find very relevant example\/homework problems. Formulas are not everything. Knowing how to use it is much more important. Pay attention in section and find a good one. Kevin is a great section leader and I've been told Nihar is as well. Just find one you like and hop around and you will learn almost everything there.","If it's a required course, take it. If you've done AP stat, find a more difficult course.","If you have to take statistics, this class is not that bad. The lectures are boring but you can learn everything you need to from the lecture notes!","Go to section! Though it's optional, it's amazingly helpful to understanding the material and doing the problem sets.  Lectures are less useful than section, but still present a lot of information.","Talk to the professor - he's great.","This course does exactly what it promises, and it does so well. Both Professor Stanley's lectures and Dennis' sections made it easy (and, sometimes, fun) to understand statistics. Anyone who works hard in this course can expect to leave it with a good grounding in statistical analysis that will probably serve them well for the rest of their life. That said, I would probably never recommend a statistics course to someone looking for a fun elective. The subject is incredibly useful, and the course is very well-taught, but it is not always terribly exciting to learn about all of this material.","First, I would like to say that the people who took this class were extremely rude. They were disrespectful to the professor, always getting up before lectures ended. I hope you do not do that if you take this class. The professor is quite good.\r\n\r\nThe course title is strangely deceiving. There is hardly any material related to economics in the course. It really should be called statistics for clinical research. All examples came from public health and medicine. That wasn't bad, all examples came from real data, but none of it had to do with economics.","I would recommend this only to people who are quantitatively-skilled. I took this for a core as an English concentrator and it was a little more involved than what would have been ideal for me. However, it teaches you useful skills and is very helpful if you have to do any kind of research in the future.","Don't take it unless you have to","A great math class (hard to find here at Harvard). Ken Stanley is extremely organized and makes the most amazing lecture notes. If you review those and go to lecture, the concepts in this class shouldn't be difficult to understand at all. :)","You have to have a basic understanding of statistics. This course is a great way to get that background. It's not too easy nor can you get behind on the work. This is harder than 100 but I think it is better. The main difference to think about is whether you want to do a personal report as your final project or a group project. I enjoyed it.","It is an interesting course with a significant workload.  Take this intro course if you really want to learn statistics.","This class is very straightforward and painless if you keep up with the material. Make sure you go to section and find a TF whose teaching style works for you, since this is best way to prepare for the problem sets.","This course is boring but well-oranized. (The course website is really hepful.)","I took this course to learn about statistics; I wish I had taken it pass fail.  Had I, I would have enjoyed it much more!","don't take it.","Extremely easy course, but nevertheless wish I had taken it before senior year. It does change the way you think about data in everyday life, and it would have informed my understanding of science had I had this course under my belt in say freshman year.","If you want to be a statistician, or are good at math, or could utilize this for your science concentration, definitely go for it. It will probably be painless for you. If you're a humanities person who wants to take it as a Core requirement or even as an elective, do not take this course. It is dry, difficult to comprehend the concepts, and in general not enjoyable.","I think it is the best of the Intro Stats options. If you need to fulfill this requirement, take this class. Statistics is also a really good thing to know.","Not very fun so take only if you are required to for a concentration\/secondary"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["If you're choosing between the intro Stats classes, definitely take 104.

If not, you won't enjoy it.","It might not necessarily be a class that you would LOVE to go to but it is a well-run class that teaches you many things about introductory statistics in an efficient and practical manner.","Lectures are engaging and informative, and the class does its best to provide students with autodidactive freedom. Two lectures times are offered. Should a student need to skip a lecture, detailed powerpoint handouts make review quite manageable. Section is not mandatory, and you may attend whichever section you like, so you are sure to find a good TF if you try.","If you need to take a statistics course for your concentration, take this one!  It is incredibly straightforward: problem sets and tests are predictable and fair.  The course gets a lot harder at the end, but it is still a simple and manageable course.","Very useful. Well designed class. Not super interesting material, but will come in very useful later.","This class is way too easy.  At first, I thought I could take this class for an easy A, but after a while I got frustrated by the busy work.  I feel like I wasted one of my 28 courses on this class, which I could have easily studied on my own in a couple of days and have come out with an equally if not better understanding of statistics.  Don't take this class if you're planning on getting your money's worth out of Harvard; take something else that you wouldn't be able to learn online.","even if you don't know what you want to study, take stat 104. It's not very difficult, the teaching staff is very friendly and helpful, the material presented is easy to understand, and it's so useful. one of the best classes i've taken","If you've taken AP Stats, you will find the beginning part of the course really, really easy, but don't get caught off guard later in the course. Start the MLR Report as early as you can, as it is extremely time consuming, and you will need breaks between long sessions of data manipulation and analysis.","This is a pretty easy class which gives you a strong background in statistics.","This is an awesome stat class.","Great class to take! Don't worry if you haven't taken Stats before.","If you've never taken AP Stat, it could be a challenge but doable!","This course is extremely well organized.

You can do well, but you will have to do the work consistently.","Invest yourself fully and you will be rewarded.","Statistics is something that you will need in all realms of life. Therefore, it should be pursued at a relatively advanced level and this class is the perfect introduction to statistics.","Know your own ability as far as stats are concerned.","1) Go to lecture. It's a lot harder to motivate yourself to watch videos. You can get through the class on slides and sections, but you will understand more if you go to lecture.\r\n2) Go to section. So helpful. I recommend Kevin Rader as a TF.\r\n3) It is a great class - it teaches you skills in analyzing data, thinking about data, thinking about other people's data, using certain software (Excel and Stata).\r\n4) This class does *not*: teach you everything about why things work (although it is more than simply plugging numbers in), teach you much about economics (although this may change as the instructor changes). So go into the class with that in mind.\r\n5) If you put solid work in, you will get solid results out. But do the work, really.\r\n6) Do not be scared of office hours!\r\n7) Do not wait until 12 p.m. Friday to work on a p-set due 4 p.m. Friday.

No previous knowledge of statistics or economics is necessary to take this course.","This course provides students with a solid toolkit with which to better understand statistics and data in society.","Statistics 104 are great, you get to learn A LOT about extremely usefull statistical concepts without relying too much on heay math, Kenneth Stanley is the best professor I've had in my life. This course allows you to become familiar with the publishing structure of scientific papers too.","Never touched the $130 textbook.","This class is a great introduction to statistics.","If you're going to take stats, this is the class to take. Well run, organized, not too hard. It's a great class.","It's a great way to learn statistics, and Professor Stanley is one of the nicest professors you will ever have - go to his office hours and he'll be more than happy to work through any problems you might have.","Stat 104 is a great intro stat course.  It doesn't require too much work, but if you don't do it, it would be easy to fall behind.","A good introduction to statistics, but the course content does not match with course title. There is nothing about economics in the course.","Doing well will take a decent amount of work. Not an elective course to take if you merely want an easy A, but if you spend a fair amount of time, you'll do well.","This class is pretty easy material-wise, but can be very time-consuming.","As someone who didn't take AP Stat in high school and is not a math person, this course was pretty accessible, but I had to work at it every day.  It was hard, but definitely worth it.  Professor Stanley is great!","The lectures are wonderful.","I took this course as an elective, and I found it to be very rewarding! Most people should learn statistics at some point and 104 is absolutely the way to go. The teaching staff is absolutely fantastic, and I can safely say that anyone who goes to lecture and does the homework will come out of the class feeling very satisfied, and will know that they have come out with whole lot more than they started with. Any student can tell that this course is one of the most well thought out and organized on campus. Ken Stanley does an unprecedented job with his lectures \/ lecture slides. Not to mention, the course is fairly easy!","You need no knowledge of anything going into the course. It starts from the very basic.","This is an extremely useful class. Don't goof off, and learn the concepts regularly, and you will do great.","Extremely useful in terms of applying knowledge to common experience.  Makes one a more informed consumer of information.","You will learn about major statistical tools.","Great professor and very well taught.","Extremely useful material, presented clearly and painlessly.  I feel like a much more literate and responsible scientist for having taken this class.  The flexible lecture schedule is great, and the expectations are always reasonable and clear.  Ken Stanley is a clear, kind, and underappreciated lecturer.  I felt that the lectures and notes were clear enough that I didn't need to go to section, so I was glad that they were offered without a strict attendance policy.  You'll know about every assignment well in advance, so it's easy to work ahead.","If you are not very meticulous, dont take this class.","The professor is really great! Lectures might get boring, but the lecture slides are fantastic and have everything you need to know to do well in the course. \r\n\r\nThe course is very clearly laid out, and you know exactly what is expected of you.

They truly have done a great job at getting in the fundamentals of statistics. And section is great. And don't save HW until Thur. evening.","Better than what I've heard of Stat 104, but if you can go straight to 111 perhaps not necessary.","Good general class to take, really helps you learn to evaluate studies critically.","Stat 104 is a very useful course that can be applied to virtually any discipline that a student will pursue at Harvard.","Prof. Stanley is a great lecturer and all of the information is on the website if you aren't able to make it to class.","You should definitely take this class if you want a practical (non-theoretical) statistics class. It's relevant to anyone who will be conducting quantitative-related research, or even to anyone who wants to understand the statistics used in papers. It's a low-stress but informative course, and Professor Stanley is a really great professor who cares about students (very approachable). The lecture slides are much more useful than the textbook.","Be ready to work hard.

Also, Professor Parzen gives pretty entertaining lectures that rarely take the full hour.","Gott love Professor Parzen and Kevin (the Head TF). Attend lectures because Prof Parzen is incredibly entertaining. Kevin's sections are very helpful, and his section materials come in handy for the midterm and final. P-sets are of reasonable lengths, not too difficult. Overall, a painless and enjoyable way to fulfill concentration requirement\/empirical reasoning\/elective! Also Stata is a very useful and applicable program to learn.","Good course if you're looking to get an introductory grasp of statistics, especially in relation to econ. Not too time-demanding, and professor made lectures enjoyable.","Stat 104 is a quick and painless way to get your statistics requirement out of the way. It doesn't seem to be a great course if you're deeply interested in the subject of statistics, but it's great if you're looking for a solid background in stats to apply to other fields. Also, Parzen is a great lecturer. He's not only funny and quirky, but somehow explains everything really clearly and has easy-to-follow lecture notes.","This is a wonderful, easy, and enjoyable introduction to useful statistics.","An extremely easy class especially if you've taken AP Stat.

Psets are fairly easy if you review the lecture slides. Exams are open note and open book--but they often require analysis that goes beyond what a closed book exam would require.","This is an excellent introductory course to Statistics. The downside is that the course is targeted at a very diverse audience, so it is simplified to some extent (more complex concepts are pretty much skimmed or ignored). Parzen is funny, dedicated, and generally amazing.

Professor Parzen makes lectures entertaining, and Kevin and Nihar are great TFs.","Take this class for two reasons: 1) The material is really helpful (regression analysis, etc.) and very applicable to all sorts of career paths.  And 2) Professor Parzen is amazing.  He teaches clearly and very well, and he makes class fun and funny.","This course is AMAZING. I'm not usually a quantitative person and I was slightly dreading the second part of my concentration math requirement but I loved this class- it was probably my favorite one this semester and Professor Parzen is probably one of the best professors I've had thus far at Harvard. He makes the subject material incredibly easy to understand and his easy-going nature and jokes make going to lecture truly fun. He also cares so much about his students and responds almost immediately to any emails no matter what. The TFs are also great- my TF was always willing to meet even during non-office hours and you can ask any of them for help. \r\nThe psets are completely stress-free (and teach you how to use STATA, which is really useful), and the midterm\/final are open book, open notes... it's definitely worth your time to take this!","If Parzen is teaching the class--take it.","That Michael makes the course material interesting and funny, the TA's are extremely knowledgeable and helpful, and that the pace of the course and the resources available to you makes it easy to stay on top of the work.","If you're looking for an easy course that teaches you applicable statistical tools - you'll love this class.

Take it with Parzen! Don't know how grades are going to come out but he seemed to give a rough estimate of 60% A\/A- to 40% B or lower. Very left skewed curve so be aware that a few points can be the difference between grades.","Professor Parzen is the man. When choosing TFs, consider Arman if he's still there. He was awesome. The course is pretty straight forward, not too much work. I would definitely recommend taking it.","This course is great if you want to learn about statistics and are interested in the subject, but you don't want to risk hurting your GPA for it -- the problem sets are reasonable and all the exams are open-book open-notes, so it relieves some stress and focuses you on actually understanding the material.","You do not need to attend section. Mike Parzen is the man. His lectures are engaging and hilarious.","This course is made very fun by Professor Parzen, but if you have a good background in math and statistics, it may be a waste of your time.

Take it if you can.","Easy, great professor, and just fun.","Very easy and straight-forward. Homeworks can be a little annoying though.","Make sure you stay on top of the problem sets.","Stat 104 is a relatively painless stat class.  The professor was really engaging this year and the material was interesting.","The professor is hilarious, the midterm and final are easy. Sign up for a section later in the week\/go to a later section after you've started the problem set and probably any questions you had will be explained. Project is kind of a pain but can be really fun if you make it. I thought this was going to be a boring, drudge math class but ended up enjoying going to lecture. Prof Parzen is awesome!","Take this over Stat 100! Prof Parzen is the funniest professor at Harvard but more importantly, a supportive and encouraging teacher who genuinely wants everyone to understand the material. It is painless and while the later problem sets are somewhat irritating (more mechanical Stata work than actual thinking) the course on the whole is terrific.","Statistics 104 is a great way to learn the basics of statistics.  It is an easy class, and the lecturer is engaging.  If you go to class and do the problem sets (which take about 3-4 hours), you will be well prepared for the class.  Material is easy and exams are open book.  Great if you're looking for an easy class to balance with a hard courseload.","Very painless introduction to statistics.","Good introduction to statistics, engaging lectures","very laid back, open book open note class, no commitment to a class- can attend different lectures at different times, down to earth professor and great TFs","This is a great class.  People might assume statistics is \"boring,\" but this class is very interesting.  Professor Parzen and Kevin Rader are the best professor and section leader, respectively, that I have had at Harvard.","This is an amazing class. Parzen is absolutely amazing. I thought it would be really boring, but this ended up being my favorite class this semester. Statistics is nothing to be scared off. Also, they teach you how to use Stata, which is great to put on your resume. Take this class!","The professor was amazing and turned a potentially boring class to an enjoyable experience. The lectures are quite entertaining and you do not realize you are learning. Take Parzen if you can.","Parzen is a great teacher, but it is taught mostly in lecture.","If you have to take a Statistics class make it 104.","This is an incredibly enjoyable way to learn about statistics. The material presented in this class is quite easy to understand and would make for a boring concentration requirement if not for the engagement of the professor and TFs. This course will demonstrate how statistics is not limited to pure mathematical analysis but can be crafted to suit any area, any idea, and any project that can benefit from data analysis.","BEST COURSE!!!  Fun (Prof. Parzen is amazing.  Makes you laugh and learn!!)  Not too involved with respect to work.  You come out of the class with some practical tools and understanding of basic statistics and regression.  Really useful and painless.  Great course.  Take it.  You won't regret it.","This is a very good introductory class. It goes quickly, but is easy and straightforward. Professor Parzen is a great lecturer and makes class very fun while remaining instructive!","Professor is funny and makes the class interesting. It isn't too hard but can be tricky at times (problem sets, etc).","Very easy class if you attend lecture. If not, its very easy to get behind and confused.","Good class - take it - it doesn't matter if you are going into econ or not","Parzen is entertaining and you'll learn a good amount.","Professor Parzen has great sense of humor and I look forward to going to his class. He is very efficient at going over 50 slides in 40 minutes (he spent the first ten minutes talking about 4lokos sometimes) so make sure you review the slides for homework. Get Kevin as your TF since he is amazing and can do crazy math in his head. The regression report was tedious but I felt accomplished. Amazing class overall. Take it!","One of the most useful classes at Harvard!!","Best introduction to statistics.","Stay on top of the work.  Even though the midterm and final are open-notes, open-book, you don't want to be wasting all your time flipping through lecture slides to find what you need.  If everything is well organized in your mind, the class is much more rewarding.","Professor is great, material is good and useful","make sure to pick a good tf","interesting introduction to stats, not too painful","Prof. Parzen is very funny!  The lecture notes are very helpful and will basically explain all the information you need to know, but it's worth it to go to lecture for the fun jokes.","Stay on top of the work load and you'll be more than fine. The problem sets aren't much like the exams so do the study guide problems which are closer. Also, Michael Parzen is the shit.","This course is very useful and also very easy. As long as you make the effort to think through the material, it really won't take you much time.","Prof. Parzen, besides being hilarious, runs a very streamlined and efficient class. The assignments and tests are quite easy, yet I still obtained plenty of applicable knowledge. However, if you did statistics in high school, then the class might seem a little superfluous.","easy, but not that interesting.","Professor Parzen is by far the most down-to-earth and humorous professor at Harvard.  Take this course if you want a breeze course that covers all the essential topics in statistics.","I think any class on statistics is useful to take, especially if you haven't taken it before (and especially if you're afraid of numbers). I chose Stat 104 rather than Stat 100 because I found the professor to be more entertaining, which I assumed meant I would be less likely to fall asleep during lecture and\/or miss class.  Parzen does joke around a lot during lecture, which I didn't mind because somehow we covered everything we needed anyway. Also, as a non-quantitatively minded person, I found the material sometimes difficult but ultimately doable.","Parzen is a great teacher!  He is very funny and you will get a good grade in his class!","Professor Parzen is a superb instructor. If you are looking for an enjoyable, clear, well-taught intro to statistics, take this class!","It is a well taught class but is fairly difficult if you have never taken Stat.","The class can be fun, but the overall structure of the course makes it hard to stay motivated throughout the semester.","Great introduction statistics course. You get a good grasp of basic statistic tools that are helpful in almost any field. Would recommend for any student. The professor was also hilarious and lectures were always enjoyable.","This is the kind of material that everyone will wish they were familiar with so I'll glad I took the class. It's fun.","Professor Parzen makes statistics entertaining! This class will help you finally understand the statistical language behind scientific papers. It's useful.","Phenomenal course. Prof. Parzen is the most engaging lecturer I have had here. The purpose of this course it to help you learn the material, not to test you on rote memorization. Nearly every TF is very knowledgeable and exceedingly helpful, something you don't find in most other classes. Prof. Parzen makes Statistics very manageable with his relevant and highly entertaining lectures.","Parzen is fabulously entertaining. The lectures make so much sense and are super useful. As long as you have a normal sized brain and know a thing or two about numbers, you will love this class.","If Parzen is still teaching this, take it. And then go to Nihar Shah's section. Awesome class.","This class is not very hard, and gives you a pretty solid introduction to statistics through an economic lens.  Professor Parzen is really funny and says a lot of things out of the blue, and makes the class more entertaining.  Lectures were fun to attend, and Professor Parzen was great about responding to emails and helping students outside of class.  If you're looking for a public health or biology focus, this class is not as relevant as it was under the previous professor.  It covers many topics pretty well and will teach you how to do regressions, hypothesis testing, probability, and other components of statistics well in addition to how to use the Stata statistics software.  The midterm and final are open-book, so don't worry too much about memorizing formulas.  Overall, this was a fun way to learn some statistics.","professor Parzen is one of the best professors at harvard!","This course is very interesting and applicable, but difficult and tedious. Also the lectures are not extremely helpful.","This course is neither boring nor difficult and teaches statistics well.","Do not take this course UNLESS you have taken AP Statistics in high school. Otherwise, you will find yourselves in a pool of students who are pretty much relearning the same material for the second year. You will never get the grade you want.","It teaches you a good skill set, but is far from engaging or fun. Take it if you want the skills it gives you, not because you think it will be interesting inherently.","This class provided a very good background to statistics, which was good because I had never had any exposure to statistics. To those who have taken AP statistics, however, the material may not be as edifying. I would definitely recommend taking the class, though, because Professor Parzen is an awesome, engaging lecturer, and I learned a lot from the class.","Take any class with Prof. Parzen!  You won't be disappointed.","The lectures are awesome and the TFs are very open to helping you out with homework assignments. This class is lots of fun!","Take this course if you need to fulfill a Gened. It is easy, fun, and also a great learning experience. Parzen is awesome. He will make you laugh. He will make statistics more interesting than will any other professor. Keep up with the material. While the printed slides are very helpful and the material seems fairly manageable, don't be too confident. The material is definitely manageable, but becomes more intricate as the class progresses. TAKE THE COURSE!","If you like Stats, this is a great intro class. The professor is great.","Interesting a simplistic introduction to statistics. Not mathematically intensive, but beneficial nonetheless.","Work on problem sets with other people as some assignments that require Stata can be very tedious. The exams are a piece of cake if you put a reasonable amount of work into learning everything they dish out. Not a hard course overall, and it doesn't take up a lot of time doing the assignments.","Definitely take it if Parzen is teaching. He makes class entertaining and explains the material well.","Although the course title targets economics concentrators specifically, I think every undergraduate can benefit for a statistics course like this one at some point in their academic careers.","you think you cool parzen","A pretty hard course, but well-organized.  Good lecturer and good TFs.  Problem sets can be quite time-consuming.","Take it because you learn a lot of stats and its relatively easy","Lecture is interesting, the subject material will confound you at first (human brains are not configured to think about probability) but eventually you will hit your stride.","This a great class!! Parzen is an amazing professor, and the class is not difficult. The exams were not bad, and the homeworks did not take long either. Though the exams are open book, I would recommend studying a little if you want to ace the exam. Overall, awesome awesome awesome!","It's actually useful. can't say that about many classes at Harvard.","This class is great and it will make you want to learn more about statistics.","If you want to learn statistics in a low-stress way, this class is for you. However, if you really want to learn real math, this is not the class for you. It's a nice introduction to basic statistics, but I feel you could get the same thing by reading the lecture slides and doing the homework without signing up for the class.","Dr. Parzen makes lectures painless,","Professor Parzen is amazing. His lectures are hilarious and class is enjoyable, yet you simultaneously learn so much. He focuses on making statistics practical rather than burdensome. The homework can be a bit tedious, but is not a hard class and definitely enjoyable.","The lecture notes are so good that you don't need to go to lecture to learn the material, but you will want to anyway. Parzen is hilarious and a great speaker.","It's a useful and easy class to take for credit. And stats is immensely useful for everything.","The course is really well taught and Parzen is a funny and engaging lecturer. Kevin Rader is also the greatest TF in the world. I learned a lot but it wasn't stressful at all.","It is a great course, but I fell behind when confused.","one of the most useful classes you can take at harvard - but if you have had a good grasp on AP stats, then maybe consider a higher-level course","Statistics is the future. This is an easy, fun, and helpful introduction. It crosses so many fields so take it even as an elective","Parzen is the best professor at Harvard. Not only incredibly smart but also a great teacher. Unlike many other professors, he is clear on course expectations, explains concepts very well, and truly wants his students to understand statistics and do well.","This was an extremely entertaining and useful course. I can't image another statistics course being this painless and enjoyable.","the professor is very funny, and lecture slides are well made.","The professor is great and you will have a great time in the class","Parzen is AMAZING.  probably the funniest and most engaging lecturer I've had here. plus he knows his stuff. workload is very manageable and the content is probably the most practical content covered here.  take it no matter what concentration you are. stats will be a prerequisite for good jobs down the line","It is as interesting as statistics can be. Professor Parzen is sweet.","Professor Parzen is awesome-- he makes himself SO available for asking him any questions and will respond to an email immediately.  He makes lecture enjoyable because he is very funny and keeps his audience.  I found section much more confusing.  The lecture notes are helpful, and the textbook was hardly ever used.","A great course. There's the perfect amount of \"comfort\" while still learning things effectively. A rather chill, but useful class where you'll do one problem set a week. The work is a perfect amount, the professor and TF's are engaging. The statistics is not super math-oriented, and its practical statistics that applies to everyday life. Highly recommended.","Professor Parzen is great.  Lectures are very productive in the middle and end of the course.  Make sure you go to lecture and try to go to section.","Lecture is hilarious! Make sure you understand the concepts.","Parzen is awesome. You will learn important concepts and have fun doing it.","This is a great stats class that teaches you skills that are relevant and practical. Prof. Parzen is hilarious and keeps class interesting. The only thing is that he zooms through lectures, making lectures more of a quick overview. You don't need any stats experience for this class; I had never taken AP Stats and I actually did better than people who had taken AP Stats."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This class is awesome!","This class is very easy and a solid introduction to statistics. Prof. Parzen is very humorous and keeps lecture interesting. As long as you have taken AP Stats, this class should be a breeze. The midterm is open book open note. As long as you do the problem sets and midterm study guides, you should be fine on exams.","As long as you put in the work, you'll be fine. Professor Parzen is really good!","Professor Parzen is awesome! This class teaches you useful information that you can use in real-life, but isn't too difficult (the problem sets are reasonable and the exams are open-notes!). Also, go to Professor Parzen's office hours--he is really nice and very willing to help with problem sets, the project, etc and is also just fun to talk to.","This is a very easy introduction to statistics. It's good if you want a flavor of what practical statistics are, how to analyze basic data sets, and how to use Excel and Stata. If you're looking for a theoretically interesting or rigorous course that will prepare you for future stat classes, however, you're probably better off taking 110 and 111 directly.","Take it, it'll do you good later on.","This class is pretty easy and Parzen is hilarious. There is not much work ( P-sets took me 3 to 4 hours a week) and if you study hard for the exams, you will do well. They post past exams on the website; take two or three and you will ace the exams. I don't see why you would take stat 100 over this class. It's dope.","Easy class that helps give a basic understanding of statistics for everyday use. Not much work and Professor Parzen is funny and entertaining.","Take this class - you'll learn a ton, it's lots of fun, and won't take over your life. Statistics is a great tool you can apply to pretty much any field, and is a really useful skill to have.","Parzen is fantastic!","parzen is a great lecturer who wants to make the material interesting and understandable to his students.","Professor Parzen is an extremely entertaining lecturer! And still gets through all the material.","it's  a good foundational ourse","This class was great.  The lectures and sections were all very informative and enjoyable.","This class is really easy but also teaches you the bare basics of statistics that everyone should know in order to read scientific papers and other published literature. I found myself understanding readings from all my other classes much better.","If you want an easy, but fulfilling introduction to statistics, this is the class! Take this over 100, if you're premed.","TAKE STAT 104 WITH PROFESSOR PARZEN. It is the absolute best, and you will soooo regret taking another course because you won't have them same amount of fun or same appreciation of statistics if you miss out on this one. \r\n\r\nDon't listen to what people say about 100 and 104 being different either - I have zero background in statistics and took this to fulfill the Gen-Ed, but it ended up being my favorite class this semester and wasn't that hard at all. It may be like, half an hour more of work per week on the problem set or something, but that's such a negligible amount in the long run because everything is made up for in the fun and amusing lectures! (Really, they're hilarious. He is a hilarious person.)","It's really, really easy, and you'll come out with a general knowledge of stat, but you'll feel unfulfilled.","If you have to take it, then do. Otherwise, probably don't bother.","Stats 100 or Stats 104?  Choose Stats 104.","This course is awesome! Professor Parzen is hilarious and really effective at teaching the most important \"takeaway\" concepts. Also, go to Kevin Rader's or Arman's sections. Both give excellent handouts and really help enforce the topics. The tests and homework were fair. I took AP stats so I found the course to be very easy, but it was also interesting because new topics not in AP stats were introduced. Stata is a bit tricky to use but not that bad.","Great overview of statistics for those who have not taken a stats course before.","Be advised: this is not an introduction to econometrics. This is an introduction to statistics for people without an interest in statistics beyond fulfilling business school prerequisites.","It's seriously, ridiculously easy. You don't learn very much. You should take Stat 110 instead if you actually want to learn something","Class is easy and Professor Parzen is a GREAT lecturer. Get Kevin Rader for a TF, and if you do, be grateful for it and go to his sections!! HE IS AWESOME!! He wasn't my TF but the help he gave me with my project was great.\r\n\r\nSome recommendations: go to lecture. They're posted online and you'll be tempted to skip but don't. If you just go to lecture, homework and the tests will BE SO EASY!!!! I didn't really go to section, but I bet if you did that too you'd be set for all of the tests and homework even more. Imagine that: 3 hours of lecture a week, 1 hour of section, and you're absolutely set on all the course material. That's really all it takes!!! So take advantage of it!!","Probably one of the most useful and fun classes that you will find at Harvard. Professor Parzen is amazing; he makes statistics really accessible and fun. I also really enjoyed all the lectures because it's hilarious to hear him rant about all kinds of crazy stuff. Sometimes the psets are kind of hard though, so you do need to put a fair amount of work. SERIOUSLY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!","This class is not too challenging since you can use your notes on the exams. If you want to go into the material more deeply I would attend section. If you want help or assistance, you have to seek it out. Professor Parzen clearly communicates the information in lecture and he is funny.","Overall excellent class. Great professor. Michael Parzen is extremely funny and I loved going to this class mostly everyday.","Go to lecture,  otherwise you're screwed.","Very easy class that provides a great intro to stat. Parzen is a great lecturer.","Stat 104 is a great introduction to the concepts and practice of statistical analysis, is helpful for a wide variety of fields, and can be taken in any year of college.","The professor is awesome.  He takes time out of his lecture every day to make his the course material applicable and enjoyable.","This is a good introductory stat class to take. There's definitely a finance slant to it, so if that rocks your boat, this is the class for you. The material is not too difficult and the workload is all right too.","This is a really easy class, especially if you have taken AP Statistics. Just stay on top of your psets, and theres really not much else to do.","EASIEST CLASS EVER TAKE THIS!!!  It's a breeze and you learn a decent amount.","Parzen is good, but the material is annoying.","Fun and informative","If you have taken AP statistics, you will have learned everything and more than this course except some regression types\/tests.","This is an awesome class! You need to take a class with Parzen before you graduate. If you're debating between this class and Stats 100, definitely go with 104. There really isn't that much more work and having Parzen as a professor more than makes up for a little added homework.","HILARIOUS!!!!!! Class is a party where you learn stuff. I even showed lecture videos to my roommate because Parzen is SO GOOD.","Parzen is a concise, informative, and very entertaining lecturer. The work-load is remarkably light, but you leave the class with plenty of very practical skills relating to statistical analysis.","This class teaches you valuable knowledge concerning applying statistical analyses to data while maintaining a fun learning environment that is not too grueling.","This is a very good class. I found myself excited to go to lecture because Professor Parzen is hilarious. The problem sets are a bit tedious, but are manageable.","super easy","If you want to take statistics (which you should to be effective in whatever you pursue), take this course. period.","This is an amazing class, and I do not say this lightly. Ok Stats is not the most interesting thing in the world, but it is really useful for econ\/business\/politics, so I would recommend you take at least one class in it, and this is it. \r\n\r\nStats 100 vs. Stats 104: well I haven't taken 100, but I can say stats 104 is definitively not stressful. I am pretty bad in Math by Harvard standards, but this class doesn't require much math knowledge at all. Instead, it requires you to think about data and make guesses out of it. Trust me, if you go to lecture, you will do really well in this class. \r\n\r\nProf: Prof Parzen is amazing. He makes lectures really fun, is super accessible outside of class and is really friendly. He has over 10 years of teaching experience, having taught at the B-School at U Chicago and the B-School at Emory. Basically, he knows his stuff. \r\n\r\nTFs: Sections are optional, but they can be pretty useful. There are a few really awesome TFs, so just ask your friends, and go to those sections. \r\n\r\nHomework: like a normal PSET class, a few hours a week (only 1 PSET per week due on Fridays) and pretty easy. \r\n\r\nMidterms\/Exam: Open notes, open book, calculator allowed, so its much more about if you know your stuff than if you can memorize all the formulas. Do a little formula sheet and it is pretty easy.","This is a great, painless intro to stats class.","Parzen rocks. Took this because I didn't know any stats, and now I know some stats, woo.","This class is not stressful at all. Lectures are entertaining to attend, and professor Parzen is a great professor!","Pay attention in lecture and make a study group immediately","I loved this class! Professor Parzen is incredibly funny and engaging and the lectures were very helpful. I loved that I could actually do the problem sets on my own without having to struggle through group sessions. It was a great intro to statistics for me. Definitely consider taking this class if you have any interest in statistics or if you just want a good class experience.","easy. parzens great but dont underestimate it. it gets harder towards the end of the semester.","This course was a great introduction to statistic, with enjouable lectures by professor Parzen. He's really funny and straightforward, and you'll never feel like you're being tricked. The tests and homework are straightforward, and there's always help available.","Take it. No matter what your concentration, take it. Best class you will EVER take","keep up with lectures, but it's a fantastic class and parzen is hysterical.","very fun course and easy. the professor is engaging and hilarious. It becomes very clear that this is an extremely useful class. You learn how to use stata which is also very useful and interesting. Great final project.","Great quantitative class\/introduction to stats.  Very painless!","you will have to learn the material on your own.","This class is great! Mike Parzen is a very entertaining lecturer, and even if I didn't always find his humor that funny or like his commentary, it always kept me awake and listening. Fun way to do math in college for those who aren't really \"math people.\" Came away from the class feeling like I didn't *really* understand statistics, but that I had learned some interesting concepts and had a little better understanding of the theory than I did before. Midterm and final are both open-note, so the stress level is low. Also, I never emailed him, but one of my friends in the class did and he would always get back to her right away (and even asked us to email him). Great teaching. Definitely take!","Stat104 is easy, fun (Professor Parzen is a very excellent and entertaining lecturer), and still manages to give you a solid introduction to statistics. You don't need to be an economics concentrator to take it. The applications to Econ are minimal, and don't require any previous instruction in Econ. Take this class!","Fun, interesting, useful.  This is probably the most useful math class you could ever take, and in addition is not so ridiculously difficult that you can't take anything else.","Great class","This class is so useful and incredibly easy with the great teaching of Parzen. He's the best!","How","It's an easy, especially if you've already taken statistics.","Parzon was great. Pretty relaxing. Problem sets a bit annoying.","Really easy. Really really easy. Parzen's pretty funny too","A great and fun way to learn stats basics. Parzen is hilarious and engaging","If you're looking for an intro to stat class that is manageable in terms of course load, take this. It makes statistics entertaining, and the head TF and professor are wonderful. Plus, it's a really easy class (open notes exams).","I would tell future students that this is a great and interesting class to take as it provides you with a knowledge of statistics that can be used in any concentration or field that you chose.","A very manageable class for anybody with any Stat background, I imagine it would also be fine without any background","It's awesome! Goes a bit quickly but the course website is very helpful in providing video recorded lecture and lecture notes.","It is very easy to fall behind because none of the teaching staff show any enthusiasm towards the course. Also, it is very easy to fall behind because lecture videos are posted online and because sections are optional. You will often find yourself learning the entire semester's material the week before the midterm and final.","this is a great course. prof parzen is one of the BEST professors at Harvard, hands down.","This material taught in this course is interesting, and this is a great way to fulfill the math requirement. Professor Parzen is also incredibly engaging.","This class was easy, but it does provide you with a basic knowledge to understand statistics.  Don't expect the class to challenge you, but Parzen is usually decently entertaining.","great intro stat class. Parzen is a great professor!!","Not bad, if you gotta do it.","Take this over Stat110. Seriously, if you want to take Stat110 ask yourself why when this class teaches you the practical basics of what you actually need to know for Economic research.","Professor Parzen's lectures are really interesting. He makes learning statistics fun and stress-free. Aim for a 100 on the midterm! Open book exams make this possible so make sure you don't fall behind your peers.","very easy class, open notes tests, and funny lectures (if you end up going), but not the most intellectually simulating class","Parzen is awesome. Good lectures, can be funny sometimes. Aside from the weekly homeworks, which could be quite time consuming, the class wasn't a lot of work. But Stats are super good to know.","This class is not only fun to take, but the material is also very practical.","Everyone says it so easy but that is totally not the case for all.","I actually did not mind going to this class, and most of the time it was pretty entertaining. Even with next to no background in stats this class was not to difficult. The assignments and exams are fair and there are really no surprises. Section helps with learning how to different types of problems, but you definitely don't have to go all the time to do well in the class. The knowledge gained in this class is actually very applicable to real world problems, especially for people interested in economics.","This class requires so little brainpower that it almost feels like a waste of time.","Literally the best Statistics course that has ever existed. Ever.","you learn a lot in this class, and the professor is an entertaining lecturer.","Easiest, best class taken at Harvard so far. Take it if Parzen teaches next year.","Really cool concepts I didn't think about before (such as how to formulate research hypotheses).","Great course. Lecture videos are online. Don't slip behind though","Really easy course, Professor Parzen is a hilarious lecture (but you don't need to go to lecture or section!!).","Enjoy a fun class, parzen is an o.g. and this is a great way to satisfy the M requirement for gen ed.","You are golden for the first part of the course if you have taken AP Statistics. Worth taking alone just to hear Prof Parzen's jokes during lecture.","Make sure you actually spend some time on the project.","You need to get a TF and if you are only doing this for the requirement I'd do more shopping for another course","It's rell easy.","A well put-together class with clearly organized lectures and involved but not overly time consuming problem sets.","Stat 104 is an easy but worthwhile course. If you are interested in a career in finance, it's great to understand how the calculations work and when they might not be applicable. It also shows you that some of the analytics we are accustomed to using to describe stocks are objective, rather than set in stone.","If you want to take an easy, introductory course of Statistics, definitely take this class! It's very low maintenance.","This class is really easy.  It gives you a nice introduction to statistics, but isn't very rigorous.","Best of the intro stat classes (100, 101, 104) and Parzen is one of the funnier professors around. Very application focused as opposed to math focused so good general overview of what to do with statistics but if you need a comprehensive stats intro","You won't get a deep understanding of basic stats, but it might be helpful if you're going into finance.","I would tell them that it is an easy intro to Stat course.","TAKE IT!","You will never be bored in this class.  Parzen is an awesome professor, and the course material is perfect for those who have never taken stats or those who want a refresher on their high school stats course.  It is very easy on the whole, but you will learn necessary skills, especially if you plan on taking econometrics.","This is going to be one of the easiest yet most useful class you are ever going to get.","this is a great, fun, easy course.","Parzen is the bomb.","Take this if you really need an \"intro\" course. It has a broad range of topics but won't feel particularly rigorous.","Very easy.  But, if you spend time on the subtleties, you will learn a lot.","The professor is hilarious. Good class to take if you have a heavy courseload and want a fun light fourth class that's still rewarding.","Fantastic introduction to statistics.  I thought I was going to bored to death by stats but found myself enjoying the material, especially the lectures.","You can get by in this course with minimal work, just go to section every once in a while to make sure you are generally on track.","This class is great. Very easy, but not boring, and applicable to a wide variety of fields.","This is a fantastic course for people who need\/want to take a Statistics course, but have never taken it and are worried about the difficulty. It's fairly easy, not in the sense that you can just skate by, but it's not difficult to keep up with or understand the course material. Professor Parzen is FANTASTIC, always keeping lectures extremely entertaining and engaging, while still explaining everything really well. And, if you don't like the TF you ended up with, that's okay, because you can just go to another TF's section (or not go to section at all!)!","This is a great class and gives a great introduction to statistics. Professor Parzen is a great teacher and explains things very well.","Stat 104 is a great class. It teaches you statistics in the most painless way possible. The professor and the TF are really only interested in getting you to learn the material, not to screw you over.","great class; take it.","This is an easy and great way to learn about stats.  The class isn't very constraining as you have lots of freedom in terms of sections.","You owe it to yourself to be acquainted with the tools and methods of statistics.","It was good. But since everyone does well, you need to do VERY well to stand out.","Parzen is a very entertaining lecturer, he seems to know the material well, and he is very open to questions. The course isn't incredibly exciting, but it's not all that difficult either.","Take this class instead of 100 if you're deciding between the two. Prof. Parzen is awesome.","Best class I've taken thus far at Harvard. Prof. Parzen makes the class interesting and positive. Lectures are relevant to not only economics but just life in general. TAKE THIS CLASS (for fun!)","This class is a good introduction to statistics, especially for those who did not take AP statistics. Those who did and scored well, need not take this class. The teaching staff members were great and generally relaxed about the subject matter. The problem sets are great. The exams are open book\/open note. You're very likely to get a good grade in this class. Professor Parzen is AMAZING and has a great sense of humor. He's very nice and personable and a great teacher.","This course is fun and interesting. Professor Parzen explains all of the material very clearly while making us laugh at the same time. The material is useful and not too dense. I really enjoyed this class as a whole.","Great class- pretty straightforward and very useful. And, of course, Parzen is the best.","This course is so easy! If you need to fulfill a stat requirement, take this class instead of Stat 100. Professor Parzen is absolutely hilarious, and this course is an easy A.","The workload is very manageable and the exams are very fair (all are open notes).  The professor is entertaining and enthusiastic, making otherwise dry material interesting.","its way easy, and easy to get by without doing any work. you wont get anything out of it though unless you actually do all the work.","Any student that wishes to learn the basics of statistics, which is extremely pertinent and useful, would benefit from this course. Professor Parzen is an awesome teacher, and it's a succinct introduction. However, it's easy to fall behind in the course because he's so lax, so just make sure to keep yourself up with the material","Solid, introductory statistics class. A good foundation for further study.","Parzen is HILARIOUS. You will love this class. However, if you have no statistics background, be prepared to put in some work to make sure you are remaining competitive with those who have a stats background.","The professor is great.","Parzen is awesome, very laid back course, easy A","One of the best classes I've taken at harvard, and definitely the most enjoyable.","Do the problem sets conscientiously.","This course is a great way to fulfill the math\/stats requirement for med school.  Parzen is a great lecturer, and the class is very straightforward.","Parzen gives the best lectures you will ever listen to in your life! A super combination of an extremely intelligent statistician and Russel Peters, his lectures are at once very informative and EXTREMELY amusing. He will also never ask you (on assignments or tests) to do anything that we haven't pinned down in section\/lecture.  Also, the tests are all open book which is great!","This class was fun and not too difficult","This class is a wonderfully taught intro to stats class... if Professor Parzen is teaching it, take it...","Parzen is both hilarious and engaging (his daily Red Bulls probably help).  Wait till he tells you his Yao Ming story.  The course provides all the materials you need to succeed, including optional section that is usually very helpful for psets.  Definitely the most fun way to fulfill an intro stat requirement at Harvard.","Good stress-free intro course","Parzen is an amazing teacher! Take this class, especially for thesis writers.  These techniques are applicable across economics, social science, and natural science fields.","Great professor! HW are hard work, but doable.","If you have taken stat before then it is a waste of time. Also, I do not feel like I got a ton out of the course.","Lectures with Professor Parzen are funny and he explains concepts in such a way that it hardly feels like you're learning. The TFs (especially Kevin) are knowledgeable and helpful. Homework is manageable, and the exams are fair (open note but still require studying).","Just because the tests are open notes doesn't me you don't have to study.","Stat teaches you basic skills in a very relaxed environment.","I thought this was a perfect introduction to statistics and is very useful.  It didn't go too deeply into the math but at the same time hit the topics that are essential to a good understanding of statistics.  And Professor Parzen is great!","Great professor with sense of humor","Very easy class with a fantastic professor. Minimal workload, but you actually do learn the stuff, and is a great introduction to statistics. Definitely important and good stuff to know.","Take this class if you want to learn basic, useful statistics without the excess stuff.","The course is not as easy as I was led to believe it would be and it easy to fall behind in the class as the lectures and sections are entirely optional. However, I would strongly suggest that you attend these as it saves time during exam time when you are trying to frantically review a lot of material. Otherwise, it is a solid course.","just teaches you how to use stata","Take this course! It is easy, but not in the sense that it teaches you fluffy and useless stuff like some of the gov courses I took here. I would say that the statistical methods (and software) are useful no matter what you want to do in the future.","Professor Parzen is an incredible teacher. I've never had a Professor who made me laugh so much. Very useful, pretty easy and enjoyable class. Take it","Awesome course.  Professor is great.  Do not be worried about taking this instead of 100- it is not difficult even without any stat background.  Totally worth taking 104","You learn a lot of useful stuff about using Stata \/ the basics of statistics and it's completely painless. There is a ton of support and reading material to make sure you understand what's going on.","This class, with a moderately light workload and fair exams, would really balance your courseload if you are taking 2 or 3 really hard courses. I felt like I learned so much as well without having to do any of the busy work.","I loved this class - Parzen is an entertaining lecturer, and the assignments are not too hard.","Parzen is hilarious and it's a fun 4th class that will let you learn some statistics without much pain. No memorization, which is the best. You actually have to understand things to answer questions, but you don't have to fill your brain with silly formulas that you'll never learn again. The concepts are the most important.","DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE FOR GEN ED!!!","Parzen is great. The class is extremely easy.","This class can easily be a fifth class. You don't need to go to class because its all on the website, but you should because Prof Parzen is hilarious. The first 10 minutes of lecture are almost always a mini stand up comedy routine.","This course is extremely straightforward.  Lectures are entertaining -- Parzen is hilarious!  The lecture notes are very clear (meaning you don't need to go to lecture when you don't feel like it).  You need to put in a bit of work for the psets, the projects, and the tests, but everything is completely doable.  If you're going to do intro stats, take 104!","Easy class","great class, parzen is excellent lecturer and teaches stats very well","Michael Parzen is a hilariously funny man--I definitely went to lectures just to hear his jokes.  It's the perfect fifth class!","Make sure to attend lecture, section and read the notes!","Go to section - its helpful to review the material and great to form a relationship with your TF when you need help with the more difficult material.","If you aren't confident in your math, don't let that dissuade you from taking this class.  Professor Parzen explains things in a very straightforward way, and the material itself is very clear.  This class gave me confidence in the analytical side of my brain for the first time in six years because everything is very straightforward and Professor Parzen doesn't purposefully try to trip you up on the tests.  Also, lectures are really fun!  I sat in on a Stat 104 lecture in the fall semester before I was even taking the class and I thought that Professor Parzen was such an entertaining lecturer that I wanted to take it in the spring.","Tests are open notebook...interpret as you will.","the class is not difficult, but make sure you study for the midterm\/final-- there is a lot of material to cover, and the hardest part is remembering what to apply to what kind of problem. as a hist\/lit\/humanities person, i found it manageable. go to section. even if you think your tf isnt very good. i didn't, and i regret it... overall, an interesting class, and parzen is a great lecturer. as someone who does not usually think quantitatively, it was fascinating to see how data can be manipulated to essentially predict the future. so cool.","A great course. Parzen's lectures make the class very enjoyable, the teaching staff is qualified and relaxed, and all in all the course teaches very useful skills in a very stress-free manner.","The lectures are somewhat entertaining because Professor Parzen is great, but the class is what you make of it... you don't need to attend lecture or section, so it's easy to do well without going. Definitely take this course over Stat 100 because the lectures aren't as boring and it's not difficult.","Parzen is a great lecturer and teacher.  Explains concepts very clearly.  No over-complication.  Straightforward material, but very practical and important.  Finally a class that will come in handy in the real world!"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This class will not require very much time. Great for every student at Harvard--including pre-vets and pre-meds.","Manageable workload, Parzen is a champ, just work hard for the midterm, project and final and your money.","You need to know stat, and this is a good class to learn it.","This class provides you with the essentials of Statistics in a non-stressful atmosphere. Highly recommended.","At the end of the semester, I was glad that I had taken the class, though the actual process was pretty difficult.","This class is really straightforward. You learn basic stats, the exams are open book, the problem sets are fair, and Parzen is hilarious!","It provides you with a general understanding of a great deal of statistical concepts and if you are concerned with grades, dont be, becuase the work is straightforward and simple.","Useful intro to stats. If you have to choose one of the intro courses, choose this one because Prof. Parzen is quite entertaining and not dry at all.","So many pluses for and intro stat class: open note\/book exam**, optional section attendance, a variety of office hour times, Parzen is a very entertaining lecturer, lecture note print-outs provided, and lectures online. \r\n**Don't be fooled, still make a cheat sheet and do plenty of practice exams\/practice problems","good for learning how to use Stata, which you might need for future internships\/jobs.","Good introduction to statistics.","HIGHLY RECOMMEND.","If you want to learn the basics of statistics, this is a great place to do so.","Don't underestimate this course!  It's awesome, though - can teach you a lot about the world and life.","Honestly, it's a completely low-stress way to learn about statistics and what you can do with it. Problem sets were interesting because you actually learned to use Stata if you did it on your own time and tried to figure things out - which then made the exams fairly painless. I actually learned a lot of information about the various topics in statistics applied to economics in this class (especially since I never took a stats class before) and now want to study it more deeply. Also, Parzen's a boss.","This course is very practical - it teaches you how to look at data and make inferences from it.  It's also not too difficult.  The Professor and teaching fellows are aware that many are taking the course either to prepare for a career in finance\/consulting or to gain general knowledge, so there is not too much of an emphasis on theory and a much greater emphasis on applications","Stat 104 is a great intro class. You learn important stuff - statistics is needed for almost every walk of life. Also, Parzen is a hilarious guy and it's a pretty easy class.","Great intro stat course with very entertaining lectures that hold your attention. Very manageable workload","This is one of the best classes at Harvard","It's easy. The lectures are hilarious, but if you're pinched for time, you can still do very well by skipping the lecture and just skimming the lecture slides when you're doing the problem sets.","A good intro to regression. Allows you to understand how polls work, to analyze statistical studies for yourself, and will come in handy if you write a thesis.","A great intro statistics class - very straight-forward, well-run, and interesting. The economics examples are applicable to life in our economy, and professor Parzen is the man - fearless, hilarious, and great at what he does.","If you have a background in AP Statistics, this class will be pretty easy. That said, the problem sets are VERY tedious and bothersome. But, the professor is awesome (:","If you're not a math person, it is a lot of work -- but it's definitely doable.","Great teacher.","This class is an awesome way to introduce yourself to basic concepts. Although it is marketed as being econ-focused, it really isn't, and if you're deciding between this and Stat 101, choose 104. Professor Parzen is an awesome guys and gives awesome lectures. The class is really well structured and rather quite enjoyable. Best class I have taken in 4 semesters at Harvard.","Fun and easy class that allows you to learn extremely useful\/applicable stats concepts in a non intensive setting!","This was a fun, straight-forward course! Stat 104 is a great way to fulfill your statistics requirement, and have fun and learn valuable things while doing so.","This class was great for anyone wanting an introduction to statistics. Don't let the fact that it is supposedly meant for economics turn you off either - anyone can take it.","Easy and useful.","Study hard.","Stay on top of the material, stay engaged with the examples, and you'll be fine.  Don't blow off the final project.","I wouldn't recommend this class if you took AP stats in high school. You'll be repeating a lot of the same material. However, if you did take stats in high school, don't just assume you won't need to go to class. That's what I did this year and as a result, I am stuck trying to cram for the test with things I didn't learn.","The class is fine and easy, and a great class if you need to learn intro stats.","Do not be deceived by the high grades that this course gives out.  ~50% of the class comes in with prior statistics experience, and if you have no experience with stat then you will have to work hard in this class (although depending on your math background the topics may come more or less easily for you).  Parzen is hilarious but not an excellent explainer of topics, which can lead to a sense of confusion and meaninglessness in the week-to-week assignments.  The course is well organized though with realistic expectations (open note exams --woohoo!) so it is a good option if you just want an introduction to what Stat is or if you want to knock out your EMR Gen Ed.","Good class, take with friends","Good for Gen Ed requirement.","Take it it's so easy!","Easy, not great.","First half of course is pretty much AP Stat. Parzen's a great (and hilarious) lecturer, and the homework\/exams are all pretty much on the easy side. If you need an easier class for your schedule, this is it :)","Prof. Parzen is a super cool professor. Just sit in on the first lecture during shopping period, and you will be convinced. He is very interesting, funny, and engaging. He makes want to learn more about statistics. The course teaches you a ton of useful tools as well.","I had never taken a stats class before and thought it would be a shame to graduate college without doing so.  People told me stat 104 was good so I shopped it. And... it was amazing!!! The class is really well-executed.  Parzen is hilarious so class is like going to SNL.  2 sections of it makes it really easy to schedule.  It is well-organized.  The lecture slides are great.  Exams are open book so it's really just testing if you understand the material (which is what an exam should do).  Really a stellar class.  I never thought I would actually enjoy a math class!","Stat 104 is truly a wonderful class in all aspects possible. (1) The teaching staff are great; Prof. Parzen especially is an incredibly effective lecturer who is at the same time fantastically hilarious and makes lectures a pleasure to attend (2) the homework assignments aren't that bad at all and the final project towards the end of the year is really cool; something that I would say is on par with CS50 final project coolness minus the allnighters. The exams for the class were also pretty easy (3) The course material is super useful and this explains itself during lecture (4) absolutely painless.","Fantastic course. Professor Parzen is the funniest lecturer ever and is able to effectively teach the material as well. Stat 104 was the one lecture I looked forward to attending each time, despite being filmed. The things you learn are super applicable to many things later on in life. You will notice things about statistics and ads that are presented.","Easy intro stat c;ass. Go to lecture, it'll pay off in the long run","This class is definitely one to take if you want a GPA booster. But even so, the class is very rewarding. Although it is easy you do learn a lot of useful skills that will help you understand many concepts that relate to statistics. The open-note midterm and final policy is also great for taking the pressure off exams and just focusing on learning the material for the sake of learning.","Even though this class is pretty easy, if you stay on top of the concepts, it'll make it so much easier for the midterm and the final.","Mike is hilarious. The material isn't too difficult to understand. Overall? It's a true gem of a course.","Stat 104 with Parzen is fantastic- my favourite course this semester. Lectures are funny and efficient and students are provided with every opportunity to succeed. Also, learning STATA is a great tool for future research.","Great course. Really fun and easy. If you've taken AP Stats, it's pretty easy, but it's nice to learn Stata, which is super useful and pretty cool.","This class is basically a review of AP Stats with some new stuff at the end. It's very easy for anyone who has background in Statistics. All the tests are open note and grading is fair, so even if you don't have any Stats experience, this class should still be manageable.","Great course! You will learn great skill, and the staff is really helpful. The course is designed to be college student friendly with two identical lectures each day, lecture videos, course notes, and help session later.","Very easy class, good introduction to statistics.","Statistics is a useful class and really gives you a good foundation for understanding statistical analyses you read in research papers. It also makes you question the statistics presented to you on the news.","My absolute favorite class this semester. Probably one of the easiest classes at Harvard, particularly if you took AP Stats in high school...you don't really learn any new material until the very end of the course. A great way to ease into your freshman year. Professor Parzen was also my favorite professor; he's incredibly entertaining in lecture, and he actually tries to get to know the students in a pretty big class. Take 104 over 100 or 101 no matter what you plan on going into, because the material is all pretty much the same across the intro stats classes. Get Kevin as your TF! And go to section!","Professor Parzen is fun.","Great class. Low Stress. Applicable to a lot of future endeavors.  Take it.","This is a great class. Take it.","Very easy class, minimal work required, don't even have to go to class or section! That said, you learn a lot about statistics. Don't take it if you want a strong foundation in statistics, this is better to take as a class that gives you a decent amount of understanding statistics, but not much. Also, it lets you learn Stata, which is a very useful skill and worth putting on your resume. Recommend w\/ enthusiasm.","This class literally had me change my major to statistics. The department is amazing and the lectures are incredibly interesting. Parzen is hilarious and makes the course simple and fun.","So easy, yet so applicable.  Probably one of my favorite classes at Harvard","An easy course. Just keep up by doing the problem sets.","Useful and painless course","Professor Parzen is an amazing professor. If you are an economics concentrator or are just interested in statistics, TAKE THIS COURSE!","Prof. Parzen is the man. Open notes makes it really easy, and it is great material to learn. Definitely recommend to anyone.","Class does not take particularly much time per week and gives a good overview of statistics with a focus on regression.","Good class.","Good basic knowledge. Parzen is great.","Take this class if you have an intro stat requirement","Absolutely the best stat class you can take. Parzen is the man! It's super convenient and painless; lectures are available online and the teaching staff is extremely supportive. I'm a math idiot, but I enjoyed this class, learned, and did fine.","I recommend taking Stat 104, not necessarily because it's \"easy,\" but because it's a really useful class. You'll actually know what it means when something's \"statistically significant\" in all sorts of research reports across all disciplines! One warning - Stat 104 is indeed a no-stress class, but open-notes exams do not mean that you can walk into the exam room having never attended lecture and armed only with the lectures notes. Problem sets can be done in a night, but the project can get more complicated than you would expect. Professor Parzen is super entertaining, and you'll actually learn a ton. Don't take the alternative \"stat for humanities concentrators\" (i.e. Stat 100)if you're scared of Stat 104 being too \"math-y.\" It's not. Anyone can do it!","It's an easy class, but I think it's useful stuff.","It's a fun way to take care of both Gen Ed and Concentration requirements.","This is sort of a perfect course - easy, very low time commitment, super fun\/hilarious professor, and useful material that you can imagine helping you later on in other classes and in the real world. Also useful to have basic knowledge of how to use Stata.","Pretty chill class, not a lot of work.","Lecture is beyond unnecessary","If you are looking for a math course that has real world applications and won't kill you with problem sets, take this class!!! Funny professor, great resources, and useful information. Cant beat that trifecta!!","Very straightforward, but it helps to keep up with the class, especially if you have limited statistics background.","Even if you have no stats, take it.  It's very easy, lectures are pretty clear (especially with Parzen, who is a great lecturer and hilarious), and the teaching staff is enormous meaning you'll probably find at least one person whose teaching method clicks with you.  Personally, I found I'd already learned most of the material except for the regression analysis stuff towards the end from various other classes.","If you have to take an intro stats class and can take 104 instead of 100, do it. Professor Parzen was amazing, and really made statistics interesting.","Parzen is the man.  This class is easy, informative, and helpful.","Didn't go to class, read the notes and did the p-sets in 3 hours. final exam is as easy as the midterm","BEST LECTURER EVER!","This is the greatest class of all-time!","Professor Parzen is hilarious. This is a great intro stat course.","Stat 104 is a great class if taught by Parzen. He's funny and the material is easy. It's easy to let this class slip, so be careful not to forget about it, because the open book\/open note format does make it easy to waste time.","If you want to fulfill the math general education requirement with a laid-back class this would definitely be one of your best options. The professor is great, the material is nothing too difficult, and the weekly homework assignment does not take too long. Moreover, if you don't like going to class every day, take this class because lecture videos and notes are posted online.","You don't have to go to lecture, as long as you read the book and the lecture slides carefully.","This is a good intro to statistics for people who want to be exposed but don't have a very strong interest in math.  It doesn't require much work and is well structured.","Great class that is very straightforward. No surprises on the exams. Parzen is also a fabulous lecturer. Take it!","Its a great class, lectures are hilarious.","it's harder than Parzen makes it out to be! don't get lulled into a false sense of security.","Parzen is the great! He is hilarious in lecture and his slides are super informative (and he prints them out and gives them to you). The workload is super manageable. I entered this class with little interest in stats and now want to take more!","This class is interesting and fun. However, don't underestimate the final. They have ended many a harvard career.","Stat 104 was a fantastic introduction to statistics. I never felt confused because the teaching is so straightforward and gets to the most important points. I feel confident applying what I learned to other fields and I'm sure it would be a good class to have moving on to higher level statistics. Parzen is an amazing professor and made lectures worth going to. The project is harder than it seems at first, but doable.","Great stuff","Enjoyable class, partially because the material is straightforward, but mostly because of the professor. Professor Parzen and Kevin Radar are both great. Take the class!","If you are gonna take statistics, Stat 104 is definitely the way to go. Parzen is hilarious and you will do well on the exams just by doing the very easy problem sets. I learned stats without even realizing it!","Stat 104 is a painless and fun way to get a basic introduction to stat\/fulfill a stat requirement.  Parzen is hilarious, all the lectures are online, and the exams are pretty easy.","Very easy course - great to take your senior year. The workload is not only very straight forward, but very useful. I feel like I learned a lot without having to put in too much effort.","It is an amazing class that is very fun and insightful.","A must for economics concentrators or secondaries.  Prof Parzen is a great lecturer and the teaching staff is very helpful and accessible.  Parzen makes the material very applicable to the business and the economy (and some politics) and he always has some really cool real world cases.  The problem sets are straight forward, nothing tricky but it would help to get in a study group so that you don't make stupid mistakes like typing something into Stata incorrectly and interpreting the wrong numbers.  The open note\/book policy on the midterm and final made them very stress-free, and the curve can never hurt you, so don't worry about everyone getting 90+ on the midterm.  Make sure you do your own survey for the group project because you get to learn some interesting things about your peers.  When choosing among Stat 100, 101, and 104, take this one.  No contest.","This is a very easy course if you took AP Statistics in high school.  Take it if you need a refresher... otherwise, this is a great course to begin with for Stat.  Parzen is hysterical and you won't have too much difficulty.","Very useful, but you have to be self-motivated to do well.","Very easy and a good way to learn basic statistics.","This course is fairly easy, and prepares you for the \"real\" world.","It's a good class for people who want have a general understanding of statistics is while not going too deep into it.","PARZEN IS AWESOME.","Prof Parzen is the man. Take this class if you are interested in finance. It beats all the economics classes you take hands-down.","If you need to take statistics, take 104.","This is one of the best classes at Harvard. Actually, though. Professor Parzen is hilarious, the teaching staff are helpful, the material is interesting, and I exited the final exam thinking: 1) I did well on that and 2) I learned a lot from this class. It's useful stuff to know, and is presented in an appealing and useful way. Take it.","Fun course! Professor Parzen is SOO great. Take this class just to see him lecture. It's also painless.","This is one of the greatest courses at harvard.  Parzen is the best professor.  If Parzen is not administering the course then I would not recommend the course.  Parzen does an amazing job of luring you into every single lecture.  He makes the course extremely fun and teaches it very effectively.  The head TF made some of the problem sets kind of difficult, but if you work with other students, you will learn from each other.  The midterm and final are both open book open note.  I enjoyed this course so much that I will be taking stat 107 as an elective even though I have already fulfilled my requirements.  I am only taking stat 107 because Parzen is the professor.  With parzen as professor, this course is an absolute gem.  TAKE IT!!","Easy, fun, AND I learned something.","Good intro.  Takes it nice and slow.  In the end covers the very basic concepts.","It's very easy and useful, a class that everyone should take.","Great time, super easy, fun professor","I initially decided to take Statistics 104 since it fulfills requirements for several concentrations. Little did I know that it would be one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard because it covers a ton of statistical material in an enjoyable way. Dr. Parzen is an amazing, humorous, and engaging lecturer who makes statistics easy to understand and applicable to a variety of real-life situations. Additionally, the class is exceptionally well-run, and the teaching staff makes every effort to help students succeed. For instance, Dr. Parzen and the TFs always scheduled extra office hours and review sessions before exams, and numerous study guides and practice tests were made available to students. The problem sets and exams in the course were also very fair and relatively straightforward. The only negative part of the class was the final multiple regression project, which was a bit time-consuming.","how engaging and personable prof. parzen is. he makes you want to come to lecture.","If you want to know how to use simple statistics practically, this is a relatively easy and enjoyable class for it. If you want to understand statistics on a mathematical level or begin to see complex situations in the world statistically, this is not what you're looking for.","This was an awesome class! I learned a lot of statistics and Parzon and Kevin are great! The workload is very manageable and help is always available.","Useful and easy course","Parzen is funny, you learn good skills, the examples he shows are funny and relevant, and you come out of the class knowing a lot about statistics.","This course was engaging and interesting.  Parzen is a hilarious professor.  The course material could be dry in other classes - statistics is notoriously painful - but the skill of Professor Parzen and his TFs makes it exciting.","Absolutely take it. An intro to stats that will help in many concentrations with very little stress.","This is an incredible course. I was very apprehensive about taking this class because I am more focused on social sciences. To my surprise, I enjoyed the course and gained so many skills from it. First off, Professor Parzen is INCREDIBLE. Not only is he a funny, engaging, and effective lecturer; he is also a genuinely nice guy who cares a lot about his students. Professor Parzen makes himself so available and will help you out in any way he can. Being able to go to whatever section you want (or none at all- not advised) is great (Kevin is an awesome TF- very kind and extremely good at explaining material). If you have any interest in statistics you'll love this class; I had no interest in statistics, and still really enjoyed this class.","easy, but make sure to go to lectures\/keep up on work. you don't want to teach yourself the whole class at the end of the semester.","this class is relatively pretty easy, low key, easy to keep up with (assigned problem sets every week), moves at a good pace. The material you learn is very practical!!","Really helpful to understanding stats, this coming from a person who had no stats background at all.","relatively easy.","Parzen's lectures are the best way to gain some basic statistics knowledge. He makes even the driest material entertaining and fun.","idk","Parzen is the best lecturer ever.","The class is fun, but don't let yourself blow it off because it seems easy.  You still need to know your stuff when it comes to exams, so keep up in this class.","The lectures are useful and funny, and the course as a whole is interesting.","Professor Parzen gives great lectures. I would recommend going to section and keeping up with the textbook readings. Great class.","This class is easy. But don't fall into the trap of not trying.","This course is easy.  Don't be afraid to take it as a fifth class.","This is a great introductory Statistics course to take. Unless you have to take Stat 110, I would definitely advise taking 104 with Parzen. You'll save yourself hours of homework per week, and you'll have a ton of fun.","Go to Paren's office hours and get to know him! He's such an interesting and hilarious person. Also, he explained things and made them so simple for me afterward.","This class is awesome. Pr. Parzen is very funny and approachable. The TFs are helpful and supportive. Learning stats is easy and fun with them-even if sometimes the psets take a long time.","Although Stat 104 does give a great introduction to statistics and does teach you how to read statistics, it requires you follow a template. It is not a particularly rigorous course academically, but I do feel I've learnt the basics.","This class might be too easy if you did AP Stat in the past.  Still, the basic introduction to Stata software is useful.","Great class; Parzen is the man; Required in Ec, though it's a good class even if it's just an elective.","This is a great class.","It is very little work but gives a good understanding of statistics.  Parzen is hilarious and also very accessible. I learned a lot of useful skills without having to dedicate much time per week.","Easy but surprisingly annoying.  Psets take a while to do.  The final project took much longer than expected because coordinating group papers sucks.  The midterm and final are open book open note, but don't underestimate them.  I think the midterm was just timed wrong for me because I found that I wasn't prepared, even with the book.  Definitely actually prepare for the tests and make a cheatsheet with all the important stuff on it so that you're not flipping through 200 pages of notes trying to find a formula.\r\nParzen is a very funny guy and often takes digressions.  Class often doesn't take the full hour.","hahahahahahah you're taking Stat.","probably the best intro stat class at Harvard! (from talking to ones taking 100, etc.)","This is hands down the best stats class out there. If you are even thinking about taking any stats at all, make it be this one.","You get what you put in. A lot of students don't go to class or section (optional) and still get good grades, others do it all and learn a lot more. All in all, the class is very relaxed and is a great introduction to stats for math people or non-mathy peopel.","textbook optional, lecture optional, section optional. Great class if you want an easy A, also great introduction to statistics- I definitely learned a lot about the basics of statistical analysis that has helped me to interpret studies in other classes.","This course is suited even for those without any background in math or statistic. Don't be intimidated by the length of the first couple of assignments. After the first 2 p-sets, the workload generally decreases to about 2 hours per week. It is a perfect course for some one who wants to fulfill their Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed requirement.","DO NOT WAIT TO WATCH THE LECTURES! Try to keep up with the work.","Lectures are funny and often end like ten minutes early- score!","It's a good 5th class.","Useful and interesting class. Exams were not too bad and lectures are very helpful and on video. Parzen is a very good lecturer.","This is a great introduction to statistics. The class is very well taught.","A great introduction to statistics.  The teaching staff really does their best to help you learn and succeed in the course.  Entertaining lectures.","Not as easy as everyone says if you have never taken stats before.","If you're looking for an easy way to fulfill a math credit, this is it. Professor Parzen teaches in an engaging and fun way. Lectures aren't mandatory and neither are sections, but I would recommend keeping up with lecture videos if you don't go to lecture because otherwise it would be easy to fall behind. You can get an A in this class without going to lecture or section once if you study.","Stat 104 is a great class. If you have taken AP Statistics, the first half of the class is a breeze, although there are applications to economics that are useful for anyone interested in stocks or finance. The midterm and final were very fair, and Parzen is the best. He is the most hilarious and laid back lecturer ever, yet he still manages to get through all the material and teach it very clearly. This is definitely not a mathy class, that's reserved for 110. But 104 is still a great introduction regardless of whether you want to continue on in statistics or not. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!","Easy and gives you a background of how to apply the concepts, but don't look for anything particularly stimulating here.","This courser is amazing. If you need or want to take  a basic statistics course, take Statistics 104. Professor Parzen is both hilarious and helpful; he returns emails amazingly quickly!","This class is great to get a basic understanding of statistics, especially as it relates to business and economics. Professor Parzen is really funny and makes the class fun to attend.","This class is a fairly enjoyable introduction to statistics. Prof. Parzen is very funny, and the lectures typically go by pretty fast, with a good combination of information and random tangents. Even if you've taken statistics before, you will likely still learn more about the applications of statistics, particularly with modeling.","do the psets in full, since they help on the exams a lot","It's the most straightforward class you'll take during your time at Harvard.","This was an amazing course. It was enjoyable to attend class, the material was very useful for life (and interesting), and the exams were very easy and straightforward. It's a perfect class.","BEST STATS CLASS YOU CAN TAKE AT HARVARD.","This class is amazing. I loved Professor Parzen and my TF Kevin Rader...go to his section if you can. Take this course if you are interested in learning how to analyze data critically and how to use statistics to understand data. Also, don't leave the final project for the last minute!","Great class, easy, Parzen is an awesome professor, one of the best I have encountered yet at Harvard. Take the class!","this is course is so fantastic, especially if you need to fulfill the empirical mathematical reasoning gen ed.. open notes midterm and final - enough said. but really parzen is fantastic. try to get into the smaller lecture. i definitely recommend this for people that have taken ap stats in high school but even if you haven't it's a great course.. thinking i might concentrate in stats after taking this!","Stat 104 is great. Parzen is really enjoyable. The class is NOT easy because you do have to put some time into doing the psets. But, overall, you learn a lot of applicable things that will help you in your vocational career.","This class is as good as everyone says. Parzen really is an amazing teacher. He's hilarious and also teaches really well. You learn a ton but don't really realize it... which kicks ass.","This is a GREAT class. It is well-organized, the TFs are always around to help you, Professor Parzen is one of the funniest and most entertaining professors I've ever had, and extremely manageable. They make the course easy for those who study and pay attention, but you still finish the course with a strong grasp on the material.","If you want an easy class, take this.  Professor Parzen is incredible.  I'll likely be taking a course taught by him next semester just because he's teaching it.  I don't think there will ever be as great of a course as Stat 104.","The class is much harder than the Q report says, but you learn a lot.","Good class, great professor","Fantastic lectures and a very fun project! Parzen is the man! Tests are easy. Take this class.","A good class but a lot of material","Get a TI-89 before taking the class. It is extremely helpful and vastly superior to the 83. Also, take it with friends so you can do the project together.","Fun and easy introduction to statistics; an easy way to fulfill the math gened for humanities people.","This is a wonderful way to affirm your own ability to do math! Also a good way to get a math requirement out of the way.","This course is very easy. Its the best statistics course there exists at Harvard. That being said, if you don't have to take statistics, don't take this course for the sake of taking a fun course. Lectures move slowly and are recorded. Finally, homework is a lot less stressful if started before the day it is due.","Parzen is awesome. one of the only classes where you can be excited going to lecture","Excellent introductory course with a friendly professor who can talk to pretty much anyone and connect about statistics principles.","Keep on top of your work cause it is easy to fall behind.","Everyone and their mothers will tell you it's the easiest thing in the world.  I didn't find it THAT easy and since so many people do super well it's very easy to underperform.  Parzen is a boss, though, and I'm very glad I learned what I did.","Parzen is a pleasure. Pretty easy class, with straight forward problem sets, no required reading, and optional sections.","Everyone NEED to know a little bit of Statistics, and Stat 104 is the answer for the newcomer.","Easy, straightforward intro stat class; great professor","It's not too hard and Parzen is hilarious! TFs are very available for help, Kevin Rader especially.","This class is great!  Professor Parzen is hilarious and will keep you entertained, Kevin Rader is phenomenal as head TF and I highly recommend going to his section is you can because he's a great teacher.  None of the exams or psets are too hard, and you will be able to do them if you pay attention.  Good intro stat class for sure, and you're bound to make lots of friends in this class or know lots of people taking it!","This is a fairly laid back class, just make sure you prepare for tests","take it, it's easy."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Easy, but at least watch the lectures unless you have already taken Stat in the past.","This class is a great introduction to quantitative finance. Many of its problem set questions and lecture examples are geared toward the financial world.","overall fairly easy class- psets only take 2 hours max Parzen is a really engaging lecturer and teaches EVERYTHING you need to know for the psets- section is optional and completely unnecessary- the midterm was surprisingly hard- beware they are making this class a bit harder due to the past years' easiness but exams and midterms are still open notes which is amazing","The material in this class is really useful and applicable to many different fields. If you have a strong foundation in calculus, however, you may prefer a statistics class that includes that material, like Stat 110.","Really fun, chill but you also learn a lot. Prof. Parzen is really fun too.","GO TO CLASS AND SECTION. this class is made out to be really relaxed and easy. but statistics really aren't. class and section are optional but they shouldn't be. unless you're a complete math genius with extensive stat background, if you don't go to class, it will be much much harder.","It's easy to get lost.","If you aren't math-minded, this class is not necessarily as easy as everyone says it is.","If you took any other stat in your life, this is probably just a big review.","A great class that is informative and easy to follow. Provides a look at a section of math that is both applicable and interesting.","Take this class. Parzen is an amazing professor and he makes the subject matter fun. I am an english\/history type person and I still found this course exciting and worth attending. Section is optional, too, which makes this class easy to fit into a schedule.","The course is easy, but make sure you don't take that for granted and ignore it.  It's only easy if you take it seriously and actually work.  That being said, if you do keep up with it, it will work out great!","the class is very manageable. i personally didn't attend lecture much toward the second half of the semester and i still managed to learn things by the end. however, i do not recommend this approach. this class is easy if you do all the required elements, like doing the p.sets weekly and not half-assing them and then going to either lecture or section somewhat regularly. if you dont put in the (very small amount of) time required for the class, it will suddenly become another difficult class you have to cram for before the midterm and final, right when all your other classes are requiring the same thing of you. so, definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a stat or math requirement, but with the cautionary advice of not getting too lax about it just because its not a difficult class.","dont take it unless you are interested in statistics.  its not an easy A","Parzen is really cool. Definitely talk to Parzen if you are worried about your grade. Andy, Kevin, and Robb are great TFs. Easy psets. Tests are fine if you just do practice tests at least twice and talk to your TF about the best strategy to answer a question.","Though people may say this is a fairly straightforward introductory course, it is important that you put the effort to prepare for the exams. The exams do not try to trick you, so make use of the past exams.","This class is not too hard, especially if you're a math person. Professor Parzen is by far the funniest professor I have ever had, and I always tried to go to lecture because he is so amusing.","This class is a good practical overview of statistics, but not for people who want a more theoretical approach.","This class is pretty straightforward\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlectures that cover all of the material, problems sets that require a few hours of work a week and are much easier when done in groups, and midterms\/exams that are open-book and very similar to previous tests. Section is optional, but definitely helpful if you are having trouble. Some people were frustrated that Professor Parzen made the class sound a lot easier than they thought it was, so try not to get overconfident. On the flip side, keep in mind that if you have a strong background in statistics, this class will either be a fun, easy review or could be replaced by a more difficult stat class that might be more worthwhile.","Professor Parzen has the lectures down to a science, but he also spends much of the class off-handedly dismissing the material for how easy it is. This is not necessarily the case for those who do not have a statistics background or struggle with math. Parzen makes a point of saying that the course is not a math course, but if that is true, the exams are definitely math exams.","Very easy way to get rid of your math Gen Ed and a good introduction to Stats. I wish I would have taken this class in sophomore or freshmen year so that I could have learned how interesting Stats could be earlier. Very well organized and the army of TFs are always extremely helpful for exams.","it is important to be statistically literate, and stat 104 is a fun and easy way to become just that. take this course. parzen is one of the bets professors at harvard and the class has a very moderate workload and grading curve.","if you aren't a computer person, sometimes getting used to Stata can take some time.","You will learn a lot and its very easy. This has its pitfalls though, it sometimes is easy to neglect and the work will catch up with you.","If you were bad at math in high school, or are a humanities senior and haven't done math in three years, think before taking this course. You might be better off with a lower level stats course to fulfill your Gen Ed requirement. Professor Parzen's awesome, and a really great teacher, but sometimes trying to follow everything when you might be struggling to remember some algebra is almost impossible.","Go to class! You can definitely learn with ease. However, not going to class and briefly glancing at the lecture slides will prove to not be enough when exam studying time comes. Nevertheless, you have time to rage? That is something that I regret. Rageeee!","This is both a fun class and one in which you will learn a lot.","It is a great, fairly easy class that is useful.","Here is what you need to be successful: (1) Attend lecture (believe me, it beats trying to catch up the night before every pest (2) Go to section - also, find a good TF's section to go to (I've heard Adam is great) (3) Do all the practice problems and past exam questions - you'll be set for the midterm and final","Parzen is the man. People will take this saying it a very easy class, and if you attend lecture and put the work in, it will be. But if you don't do the work, then it can obviously not be easy. The material is very useful to know, and the class is somewhat easy.","It's very easy and the professor is amazing and hilarious. It's also just a very useful topic and one that can be used in any field or concentration.","It's a good way to fulfill a gen ed and is pretty useful. Just know that as someone who does not do anything math related (I'm a social studies concentrator and haven't taken math since high school) I did find some of it pretty difficult. It's totally manageable, especially if you go to class\/section, but if you're like me and are not naturally inclined to quantitative work, try not to slack off and to take the class seriously.","Professor is hilarious.","Parzen is hilarious and a great guy.","This is a great intro course that is not super demanding.","Stat 104 is a great class to take if you're interested at all in statistics.  Professor Parzen is a great lecturer, and the material is actually quite interesting.  The course is also easy if you are willing to put some time into it (e.g. actually watch lectures and think about problem sets).","It is hard and requires work.","This class is more difficult than it seems.","Stat 104 is largely as advertised. Problem sets took anywhere from 45 minutes to 4 hours, but nowhere as much as other classes. The material is straightforward, but not simplistic. If you have never taken statistics before, it will still take some outside effort to understand well. Go to lecture!","This class is how much you want it to be. Since all exams are open notes, how much material you absorb depends solely on you.","I think this class will end up being one of the most applicable that I take at Harvard. It gets a reputation for being easy, and it certainly is easy, but not unnecessarily so. I am glad to have taken it because I feel like everything that I learned will be useful. Also, Parzen is the man.","It is a good class for learning the principles of statistics.","Although section is optional, I highly recommend it. It will help you really understand the course material because lecture alone won't do it.","Stat 104 is a great, straightforward intro statistics class. If you've never taken a statistics class before, definitely take it. If you have, it's probably not worth it. It's a low-key class; problem sets are long enough for you to learn the material, but not excessively long. Parzen makes this course what it is, and he's a great professor. When you go to his lectures, you feel like you're watching a stand-up comedy routine and learning statistics at the same time. If you put in the work, you won't have to worry about your grade, and you'll understand all of the basics of statistics by the end of the course.","This is a good class to get you through the basics of stats. If you want an in depth look at the field of statistics, this probably isn't the class for you, but if you want a low key class that teaches you the stats you need for economics for example, take this class and enjoy it!","Make sure you do the practice tests.","The class was more difficult for me because I had not taken AP stat.","Take this class. You learn useful information for any field of study and Professor Parzen is absolutely hilarious.","Okay class but not very stimulating.","Solid stat course, but don't underestimate the exams.","The stuff you learn from Parzen can be applied in any field, humanities or otherwise. Even now, filling out this Q-score, I'm considering how many different ways I can analyze the data regression. It's like a low-key CS50 in that regard; ever-useful, ever-fun, with a superstar professor who should really be more famous than he is. I'm a fan.","This is a great introductory course to Statistics. Prof. Parzen is very enthusiastic and makes going to lecture fun. You only have one problem set a week, and those are fairly straight forward. Although it is not required, going to section is helpful because the TF basically lines out how to do problems similar to those on the problem sets. Besides weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final exam, there is one final project that's worth 20% of your final grade. You can do it basically on any topic so the work becomes interesting. Overall, this is a simple Statistics course and is a good way to knock out a Gen Ed.","Take it!  If you are looking for an intro to stat class this is the best one.","It's extremely well taught and you will learn a lot no matter what you're major. Even for pre-meds, its a great class to take to fulfill the stat requirement.","This is an easy intro class to statistics perfect for someone with no prior knowledge on statistics or economics.","It seems easier than it is - put the work in and it will be rewarding","This is a great class. All lectures are videotaped and exams are open book\/notes. Parzen is a wonderful lecturer, which makes it enjoyable to go to class. Sections go over material from psets. That being said, make sure to keep up with the psets and materials because the midterm can catch up to you rather quickly","This class is not as easy as people say it is. It fulfills a lot of requirements, but I wouldn't recommend it if it's not necessary.","Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you can coast in this course. Keep up with the coursework.","Doing well in stat 104 is not, as some may say, as easy as doing nothing.  However, you will absolutely do well if you do the psets yourself, study for the exams, and work hard on the final project.  The course is not trying to trick or surprise you in terms of difficulty- in other words, you will get exactly what you put into it.","Professor Parzen makes coming to lecture a fun experience, not a task. This is a fantastic way to satisfy the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed while also opening your eyes to the world of statistics, which can be very difficult from traditional math. The workload is more than manageable, and through section, office hours, and simply attending lecture, you should be able to do well in this class. Professor Parzen understands that this is a Gen Ed, and it is clear that he really wants everyone to do well! His sense of humor makes lecture enjoyable, and he really seems invested in everyone's understanding of the material. Take this class if you're look for a moderate Gen Ed that will not take a lot of time and is enjoyable.","This is an easy math class.","This class is really great. Open note and book tests and an awesome project at the end. Definitely take it.","Stat 104 is not as easy as students make it out to be. You still need to study and put effort into the class to do well in it.","Very applicable material. Quite easy.","This is an easy class, but is very boring and disorganized.","Stat 104 is a great class - much easier if you have a prior stat background.","Parzen is very funny and sometimes self-deprecating. The course is run really well. As long as you keep up with lectures, be it in person or through watching the videos, you shouldn't have a problem.","take this class if you're thinking about consulting or finance. this is literally what a summer analyst does, so roll up your sleeves and get on Stata. #plugnchug","Awesome class.","This class is a fairly easy start to a career path into business, statistics, and economics. Lectures and sections are not mandatory, and all the needed information is online. Only the basic, easiest information is tested on tests. Projects are fun and flexible. The staff is very knowledgable, but one needs to go out to them if not they get nothing - nothing is mandatory! Very interesting class though, teaches you the basics of statistical analysis and inference, similar to what would be taught in an AP STATS class, but with the addition of learning to use STATA, a statistical program useful in some careers, and with learning of finance topics such as portfolios and beta. EXTREMELY INTERESTING. Professor Parzen is hilarious, though lectures are recorded but not required, you should stil go to his lectures to enjoy.","A good class to take if you have never taken statistics before. I learned a lot, and some people say lectures are unnecessary but honestly that was because they've probably taken stat before. if you have 0 experience, this is the class for you.","This class is relatively easy most of the time, but DO NOT slack off when exams come around! The exams this year seemed more difficult than the homework problems (and past exams), so make sure you understand the material going into them.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this course was really helpful. As someone with ZERO statistics background, I now feel significantly more confident in my ability to look at data and extract useful information from it. If you're trying to fulfill the math requirement, this isn't a bad choice at all. I took it as an elective just because I didn't know any statistics.","It's a great introduction to statistics.  Be careful to keep up with the material; it'll make your life so much easier when it comes to exams and the final project.","Don't take this class if you're looking for a course that is intellectually stimulating or challenging. However, do take this course if you need to fulfill a concentration requirement or want to gain a solid foundation in statistical analysis. Professor Parzen is engaging and entertaining. The workload varies (depending on your background in statistics) but is definitely on the lighter side. If you do the homework, you will be more than prepared for the exams.","Parzen is great, class is very well run, but the only way this can be considered an \"easy\" course is if you have significant experience in Statistics. However by the end of the class, I feel legitimately confident in my statistics skills and understanding","It's helpful if you know some stat ahead of time!","It was a great intro to stats class that is fun and not difficult.  You learn some pretty neat stuff.","Stat 104 is a very well organized introductory statistics course. It provides you with essential skills that are useful in just about any field you enter.","Parzen is awesome, he is worth taking a class with. The class is fairly straightforward, no surprises really. The vast majority of people who take this take it because they have to.","If you have never taken statistics before, this class is the one for you! It was a great introduction to the subject. Professor Parzen is hilarious and the course really sets you up for success. A lot of students will tell you that this class is easy. While it was one of the easier classes I have taken at Harvard, it still certainly requires that you put in the necessary time and at least watch all the lecture videos. \r\nI was nervous about choosing which stat class I should take to fulfill my requirement for social studies. I am so glad I chose stat 104 and would definitely recommend it to any students in the social sciences. I learned so much useful information about statistics and was never stressed out about the class.","Stay on top of the work and go to section. You don't learn how to solve the psets in lecture. you learn it in section.","Take it for sure! Parzen is a great professor. The course isn't that hard, and the stuff you learn is very applicable. Parzen makes lecture fun.","If you need to fulfill a math requirement, or are at all interested in statistics, this is a great course to take before you graduate from Harvard. Don't be fooled by the \"it's an easy A\" mantra that you may hear about this course.  You have to stay on top of the material, if you don't you'll get lost quick!","Stat 104 was a great class for me to take freshman fall. It was a pretty low workload but still a really interesting class. The group project at the end was also a good way to explore real world applications of what we had previously learned in lecture. If you are considering taking an intro stat class and are interested in economics, definitely take Stat 104!","Definitely by the course packs. Seriously, they're very useful because you can use them to (1) take notes in class (2) refer to when you do your homework and (3) bring to the open-book tests.","Great class! Learn a lot about statistics. Not math heavy but class is worthwhile to take. Lectures are entertaining yet informative.","Relatively straightforward introduction to Stat. Parzen has very clear expectations so you will do well in the course if you stay up on the work.","Stat 104 is a good way to get a math gen ed if you are not a math person. You do learn a lot and stat is important. Although many people had described this class to me as very easy- it is not. Be aware that you are going to have to study very hard for the midterm and the final and the final project can be time consuming.","Everyone says the class is ridiculously easy.  I think the class material actually covers some rather decently difficult things.  Parzen just tries to make the class as accessible as possible, with tons of online resources and open book exams.  The class is only easy because Parzen is such an excellent teacher.  After the course, you will be better able to understand and interact with statistical data in academic papers and news stories.","Just take it. You know you want to. It's like a breath of fresh air. A breath of calming, relaxing, not-a-care-in-the-world fresh air.","take it","Do not let the constant talk about how \"easy\" this course may be fool you into complacency. Yes it is open book and open notes, and yes it is not the most difficult class on campus, but if you take the exams lightly and try to depend more that just a little bit on your notes during exams, you will do poorly on them.","The class is a good overview of some concepts in statistics, but I honestly think that there are other courses where you can learn much more. Unless this is a concentration requirement, you should probably take advantage of the vast resources of this school and take a more worthwhile class where you'll learn much more.","It's easy if you put in the right amount of work. You may want to skip lecture and treat everything as a joke, but if you do, you will be in trouble when the tests come around.","If you are a gov concentrator take Gov 50 - Stat 104 while fun is not worth the extra time and energy and is not that applicable.","Stat 104 is easy and the lectures are fun. Even if you're nervous about taking a problem-set or math-oriented class, the amount of support in this class is great.","It is an excellent class that is very relevant with the world. Parzen makes the class so interesting. It however was not a very good introduction to Spanish.","not as easy as people say it is; concepts are hard if you've never taken any stats, but workload is low and very manageable.","Easy if you have time for it, very similar to AP Stat in high school.","This is a great intro to Stat. Professor Parzen is hilarious, and the course is very manageable if you stay on top of your work. That being said, make sure you do the work, because if this is your first exposure to Stat it's very easy to fall behind!","Great class! Take it!","It's important to take because understanding statistics matters.  But there are some problems with this class.  For example, Professor Parzen essentially encourages people not to take this class seriously by making tests open note, browsing twitter during lectures, and giving out extra credit assignments like \"tell a joke related to statistics.\"","Although this course is not the most difficult class in the world it is definitely not a class that should be looked past.","Stay ahead of your work even if it seems easy.","When studying, make sure to use the breadth of study materials available and focus on doing practice problems.  Doing problems helps more than straight studying.","Be ready to know the material and apply it on a variety of questions.","Good class for stats intro. Lecture is a pleasure to attend because Parzen is clear and in good humor. Stay regular with your work and this will be a smooth class to do well in. Take advantage of help sessions for homework, etc--they are very available and helpful.","Great class. A little on the easier side, but very reasonable.","This a great class that is designed to help students succeed. Professor Parzen is super fun and always makes the lectures worth attending. Even if you can't make a lecture, you can see watch it online. The exams are very straightforward, the final project is fun, and sections are not mandatory. Overall, this is a great class that is not made to trick students, and you really do learn a lot about an essential field of study.","It is as easy as people make it out to be. I don't think I needed a curve for an A, but don't expect to get it from not working. Do every Pset","An amazing class.  Professor Parzen is great!  He makes lectures fun.  Very entertaining and you learn a lot.","Its not as easy as people say...","This is not an easy course, even if people say it is. Be ready to work.","Good intro to stat. Pick a good group for your project. Put in work - don't just think that it's an easy course because people tell you it's an easy course. It's easy if you treat it as a normal course at Harvard but you can't just coast through the entire semester. Not gonna happen pal.","Professor Parzen is a superstar.","If you would like a deep, thorough knowledge of statistical theory, this may not be the right course (although it will set you up for 110 very well, which will probably provide you with everything you need in that department). However, for those looking to take an EMR course that is engaging and rather light at the same time, this is a great option. Don't bother buying the textbook--just buy both sets of the course notes and annotate them along with Professor Parzen (who is hilarious by the way). A low pressure, good course overall!","Parzen=the man","Great class! Low workload, entertaining professor, and very relevant and useful material. Fair exams, too. Take it!","The professor and the TFs all want you to succeed -- I learned a lot of valuable information from this class","A very informative course. Go to class because Parzen is a great teacher and is pretty funny. Do the homework and be able to understand it and you will be fine.","Don't be too into Parzen's \"this is so easy\" attitude, and do the work. Sure, its easy for him--hes a professional statistician. This is intro stat. Lets be real.","This class is really easy. If you put in minimal work on the problem sets and preparing for the exams you will do fine. However I don't feel like I really learned statistics as well as I had hoped.","Parzen is the man. He's hilarious. The class is very manageable, and the workload is light - one problem set a week, which doesn't take very long, granted that you understand the material from the last week's lectures. Lectures are all taped so most people don't go. The project is actually quite fun and feels rewarding when you successfully run your own regression. I would definitely recommend the course. Plus all tests are open notes - just make sure you either have a great formula sheet or know what to look for.","This class requires you to apply the information you learn in lecture. You need to put the work in, but if you do, the class is well worth it.","Take it. Easiest, most painless way to learn basic statistics. You don't need any stat background to do well in the course.","If you would like a basic foundation in statistics with also a little intuition for how stocks work, this is a great class for you.  You will not walk away with a thorough understanding at all of the proofs for the statistical tools you will learn, though you will learn when and how to apply them.  It all depends on the rigor you want.  The teaching and lecture materials are great, and there is a lot of help offered outside of class as well.","If you are not a math and science person, this class is a good way to fulfill your Empirical & Mathematical Reasoning requirement. Professor Parzen is good at explaining material and making difficult concepts easy to understand, and he is funny and entertaining. Lecture can get a bit boring at times, but generally, it is laid back and serves as a necessary piece to getting through the class. Lectures are posted online, which is extremely helpful, and sections are optional, though I found them very helpful in gaining a better understanding of concepts. Workload is by no means overwhelming, with a 4-10 question problem set each week, 2 exams, and 1 project. This was not my favorite class, and I did not necessarily love it, but it is not difficult, it is a good way of fulfilling a math requirement, and Parzen does his best to make material interesting.","This class is presented as a very easy course. If you take it seriously and go to section, lecture, etc. it is definitely not difficult, but students often neglect all work until right before the midterm\/final rendering the class more stressful than it needs to be.","Parazen is the best.","This course is easy, but not easy if you don't put any time into, which was me case. Do the psets on your own and then you'll be fine. But don't think you can't do anything to get an A.","Although you may want to take Stat 104 for its reputation as an 'easy' course, I would reinforce that this class is much more than that. The knowledge you gain about data analysis is interesting and applicable to most fields of study.","lol it's stat 104. just do the work and take it fairly seriously (ie: spend *some* time studying for midterm and final, and do the project) and you'll be fine.","Stat 104 is generally considered the \"easy A class\", but I would caution future students about this. Stat 104 will only be an easy A class for you if you have an AP stats background or you are naturally gifted at statistics. For me, it definitely wasn't an easy class. In comparison to the other math and stat classes at Harvard, yes it's easier, but it is not an easy course in general.","Great for an intro stat class.","This is a really fun class. Parzen is a great lecturer. However, it is challenging, especially if you have never taken stat before. Tons of people take this class who haven taken AP stat as a way to get an easy A. Ignore them. They are wasting thier own time (and money). If you want to learn somthing new, try it!","A class that teaches you the very basics of statistics. It is a good introduction to stats and is not difficult.","great class. don't take it lightly. yes it is one of the easier harvard courses but you still have to study for it!","This is a very easy course...if you do all of the work. Parzen is generous but consider carefully before taking this as a 5th class.","It is practical, engaging, and overall, one of the better classes that the College offers.","This class is not hard unless you make it hard. A lot of people just copy psets and don't take it seriously. As a result they get nothing out of the class except for a bad grade. Take it semi-seriously, do your work yourself, and you will get a good grade and learn something.","A low-key class to satisfy your math requirement, though until I started going to section, I didn't feel engaged enough to actually absorb much. Even though it's easy not to, I would recommend going to section.","Because this class doesn't have a heavy work load and still counts as a gen ed, take this course during a semester where you have other intense classes.","A great, easy introduction to statistics! Take it! Professor Parzen is hilarious and his lectures could very well be the highlight of your day!","Certainly not an easy course, but one of the few courses on campus where the Professor actually cares about his students and wants to help them.","Take this if you are looking for an easy 5th class. I wouldn't take this because you are worried about your workload, only take it if you are genuinely interested in the material. Also, if you took AP Statistics (no matter how little you feel you learned), I wouldn't take STAT104. Take a more advanced course. That said, Parzen is awesome and super funny, and half your class will probably take this course (which is nice for homework and the project). I found section the most helpful component, so even though it is optional definitely go.","This class is probably necessary for you if you're considering it. If not, and you're just looking to be introduced to statistics, you should take it; there is not a heavy workload (though it wasn't a laughing matter, at least for me...), Professor Parzen makes the lectures enjoyable and interesting, and the material is necessary for a firm foundation in statistics.","Absolute gem. Every student at Harvard should take advantage of this class. Parzen is a great teacher and hilarious in lectures.","Parzen is  a god! You learn a lot while at the same time, laughing through every lecture!","It is NOT an easy class if you didn't take statistics in high school; don't listen to people who say that it is. I'm not necessarily bad at math, but it was often very difficult to finish the psets based on what you learned in lecture alone. Work in groups with people who have that statistics background. (Parzen is an AWESOME lecturer, though; he makes otherwise boring topics really funny. You'll look forward to going to lecture.)","This class is a great class and you should most definitely take it! Parzen is a great and entertaining professor, and his lecture notes are very clear. Make sure to put effort into the class, because many of those who didn't care suffered. If you put the time in and make sure to study for the midterm and final, you'll do great!","Don't underestimate this class! Just because a lot of your friends have taken it and the midterm and final are open notes doesn't mean you can skip lecture and assume you'll understand everything. Parzen sets you up for success- if you do what you need to, you'll be fine.","Stat 104 is a good introduction to basic stats, and Prof. Parzen is an engaging lecturer who manages to keep dry material relatively interesting.","Easy A, and does teach you some basic statistics concepts, but it's not that fun or interesting.","Midterm is surprisingly difficult if you don't study.  People say this is the easiest class ever, but you do need to put a little bit of effort in.","The Best Class ever. This class is very easy. Also, you learn how to use STATA and have a grasp on integrating statistics with STATA.","Take the course, the homework is straight forward and it is quite interesting.","go to class\/watch the lectures, and this class is totally manageable. also, parzen is the man.","I loved Stats 104.  The lectures are always funny, and not too long since they are only an hour.  Its really easy to just go to lecture and sit and listen and you feel like you absorb the information, but since lecture isn't required its not a big deal if you can't make it and watching it online works find.  The course load is totally do-able and fair. Section is awesome, even though its not mandatory I highly recommend going, it makes exams and psets much easier!","A good course to fulfill a math course if math isn't your thing--the \"optional\" feel of sections and lectures can make a lot of the information pile up before the midterm and final, so make sure you don't fall behind.","great class. take it.","Not as easy as most say if you're not good at math.","Lectures are engaging but not necessary. Material is well organized and well taught. Parzen is funny as hell. Although the pace of this course trends towards glacial, I do feel like I've learned statistics. But don't take STAT104 if you have any background in the subject.","Make sure you continue to attend or watch lectures through the semester.  It can be tempting to slack off, but attending lecture really helps in the long run.","This is a very interesting course that does not take up a ton of time. I highly recommend it!","This is a nice course that introduces you to statistics- you might not want to take it if you were exposed to statistics before. But, for people who have not taken a statistics course before this course is ideal and it is a very straightforward course.","This class was great! Parzen is interesting in lecture and the homework is extremely easy if you go to a good section. The exams are very fair...just make sure that you do study because a lot of people tend to overestimate their knowledge based on how they do the homework, neglect to study for the midterm, and bomb it.","This is a fantastic course, with plenty of real-world applications. Parzen is a fantastic lecturer, adding humor to the material. It is highly recommended that you attend both lecture AND section, but you will not suffer greatly if you miss one on occasion. The problem sets are fair, and manageable, the exams are more difficult than you would expect, but still manageable, and the final project can be a lot of fun - but take it seriously. There is ample help available, but only if students seek it out. Tom was an incredible TF, and made the material straightforward. Overall, a solid class that teaches relevant skills. It is very possible to get an A in this course with a little work.","It's a great way to fulfill your math reasoning requirement and actually very useful and applicable to other studies.","Very painless class, enthusiastic teaching staff, and overall I feel like I learned a lot!","Not the bird course it once was, study for your midterm and final y'all.","Stat 104 is a great class to balance out a difficult schedule. It's not overly time consuming and Parzen is very entertaining. Make it a point to go to lecture and pay attention though and it will make doing the homeworks a lot easier. Don't be fooled into a false sense of confidence before the exams either, as they can be trickier than people will tell you.","I would only recommend if you desperately need an easy class to balance your schedule or if you are required to take a stats course! However, Parzen is really funny and the project can be fun if you are creative.","Parzen is the man and this may be the best and most relevant class offered at Harvard; should be bigger than Ec 10","Stat 104 is a good, relatively easy yet informative statistics course. It's a good way to take care of a Gen Ed requirement, and it teaches you some interesting things that are relevant to more areas that you would first suspect. Professor Parzen also has a great sense of humor, and the course as a whole is kept really low key and low stress.","Easy, entertaining course. Definitely take to fulfill statistics requirement. Also, I found section (which was optional but I went to most weeks) to be incredibly helpful in terms of understanding how to do the homework and apply what was presented and lecture.","By far the best way to fulfill a stat requirement-Parzen really helps you learn. While it's not painful, I would advise against taking it as a \"fifth class\", since the problem sets can be time consuming.","It's boring and tedious, especially for those who are not mathematically inclined.  It's also not nearly as easy as people say it is.  Professor Parzen does try to keep the lectures spicy, but there's only so much he can do.","Every one of my friends recommended this course to me because it is an \"easy course\". However, I did not find the course easy at all. I went to section every single week, went to almost every lecture, and I did all of the homeworks on my own but I still struggled with the material. Make sure that you go to lecture! And do not go into this course thinking that it will be an \"easy A\" because unless you are really good at statistics and problem solving, you will have to work to get a good grade. However, the day to day workload is rather light which is nice.","This class teaches you indispensable skills for many concentrations, Parzen is a great professor, and the class is not a strain at all.","Stat 104 exceeded my applications. What we learned was relevant and quite helpful, and the class as a whole was well-organized.","They held my hand the whole time... Which made it somewhat embarrassing when I didn't ace the midterm.","Don't put this class off. Do the homework, study for the exams, and do well on the project. If you forget about this class because you've heard it's an easy A, it will come back and bite you in the behind.","It's a really straightforward class and a painless way to learn one of the most useful skills there is to know. I would recommend this course to every student at Harvard.","Useful without being too difficult. Great to balance out an otherwise difficult course load!","everything that you hear is true about this class.","This is the most useful, well-taught, engaging, and practical course that I have taken at Harvard so far. Professor Parzen is a fantastic teacher. Lectures are engaging. Homeworks are useful. The final project allows you to apply your knowledge. And all the material that you learn applies to the real world. The TF's are fantastic too. Take it!","This is a great class. It isn't stressful and provides you with a basic knowledge of statistics (which can be very useful in the sciences)","It's not hard, it's not that interesting, and you are better off taking something else.","so so so so so so easy\/","It's not too difficult of a class if you pay attention and do the homework, but you will only gain a small understanding of statistics.","You learn very applicable concepts, but don't come into it thinking it is a blow-off!","Stat 104 lives up to its reputation as a manageable, low workload class. The class does teach valuable skills but it's not a huge amount of work. Parzen is really funny and approachable and teaches well. All of the lecture slides and past exams are on the website so it's very easy to study for exams, and you also technically don't have to buy a book or anything. Section is optional but I found it useful to go to review problems similar to those on psets. The class is graded very generously and it's a low workload. That being said, it still takes some work so don't assume that it's a piece of cake and not study or do any work because then you'll just end up getting a bad grade in an easy class. Overall it's a great course to get the basics of statistics, fulfill a requirement, level out the semester with a light workload class, and learn useful skills.","Great and painless introduction to statistics.","It's hyped to be an easy class, but isn't necessarily as easy as everyone says it is if you have not had previous stat experience.","Stat 104 is a great class that teaches you the basics of statistics. It's an easy way to pick up your EMR credit and a good introduction into the world of statistics. The work is very manageable, and Professor Parzen is an awesome lecturer.","so so easy!! parzen is hilarious. and stats is useful or something","IT'S GREAT TAKE IT.","Great course, good information to know, great professor, easy to catch up if you miss anything","If you've taken stats before, definitely take this class. If you haven't, watch out for the midterm.","Just because it's \"easy\" doesn't mean you should slack off. Definitely study the practice exams when you're studying for the midterm and final.","study hard for the midterm and final and do a good job on your project and you will be fine","This course is simply excellent: fair, enjoyable, interesting, and applicable to life beyond college. Professor Parzen is an exciting, knowledgeable, and kind professor. He takes what could be dry material and transforms it into interesting, contextualized lectures that everyone enjoys. The workload for the course is fair and is never too much. The course is adequately challenging while letting students demonstrate their mastery of the material. Moreover, this course endows students with statistical concepts and tools, such as familiarity with Stata, that are essential for success in any career. This is a quintessential college course that everyone should take, and I am very glad I did.","Fairly painless way to fufill a gen-ed.  Section is usually a more efficient use of your time than lecture.","It is an easy class when you don't slack off. Go to lecture even though there will be about 20 people at most in lecture by the middle of the semester.","This class helped me to think about the world from a completely different perspective. I constantly find myself asking if something is significant or how I could possibly make a model to predict different things that happen around me.","Good as intro to statistics. Do not underestimate it, or it will get you.","Very easy class but the basic skills you will learn are also quite useful later on so try to actual remember what you're learning even if it is not necessary for the exams (which are open book and open notes). Definitely take it if you have room and are at all interested","Stat 104 is a great way to learn about basic statistics and fulfill a gen ed or concentration requirement.  Parzen is hilarious, the information is presented in an easy-to-learn fashion, and the course is relatively easy.","A painless way to fulfill a Statistics requirement; workload was very manageable.","This course is relatively laid back and interesting.","Don't be concerned if you have no previous statistics experience. The slides have everything you need to know and are a great reference. Problem sets are good practice. Stata is a great tool to learn how to use.","This is a pretty laid-back class, and you learn quite a bit too. I would recommend this class.","Use the Study Guide made by Professor Parzen. Everything you'll ever need is in there.","This class is very great. The lectures are amazing, the lecture videos online are very helpful, the lecture slides are very straightforward, and the teaching staff is excellent.","Don't be fooled by the people who say this class is a joke. It's not. It takes a lot of work, and if you're not a math-brained person it can be difficult. GO TO SECTION. It helps immensely. Also be sure to study hard for the midterm, a lot of people didn't study and it ended up hurting them a lot. Parzen is a very entertaining professor.","TAKE STAT 104 IF YOU WANT AN EASY A AND WANT TO ENJOY COMING TO CLASS :)","Great course. Parzen is the man!","It's not an intense course--nor is it reputed to be--but you can definitely learn the basics from Stat 104.","This class is an informative, yet not too difficult introduction to statistics (particularly to statistics as it can be applied to economics). Parzen is a hilarious, knowledgeable and easily accessible lecturer. Make sure you go to lecture -- sections are not necessary if you can't make it. Also, you must must must have a great study guide for the midterm and final. The exams rely on you being able to locate your notes quickly and being able to translate that efficiently into an answer fast, so if you are disorganized you will get crushed. Also, don't procrastinate on the project - the sooner you start it, the better. Take advantage of TF and Parzen's OH to help guide you.","Thanks to this class I was able to statistically prove how much the eagles suck. Thanks Stat 104!","Great class. Easy if you keep up with the material. Parzen is super cool.","It was an easy, fun class that can be used to balance out more difficult courses.","Easiest class I've taken so far!","GO TO CLASS. GO TO SECTION. The class is only easy if you go to class!!!!","it is great","Fairly easy, low-expectation class that has a reputation for being easy. That being said, the material is taught well and if taken seriously is a good intro to statistics.","Everyone will tell you that this class is a piece of cake. Compared to other classes at Harvard, yes, this is a relatively easier class, BUT for those of you who have NOT taken a statistics course in high school, be aware that you will have to put in a little more time into the class than other students who have already taken statistics in high school.","It seemed like the purpose of this course was to learn how to use the computer program Stata. If you don't want to learn that or just have a desire to learn Stats in general, don't take this course.","This class was my favorite this semester. Professor Parzen is great and it was easy to get help when needed.","You can afford to be relaxed about this course, but don't blow it off or you may find that you will fall behind.","Great course--learn a ton of real-world applicable concepts and skills without the BS memorization that accompanies many college-level math classes. Well-taught, reasonable in terms of time commitment and difficulty.","This course is almost trivial. I took it to balance out some other very workload-intensive courses, but would not have otherwise. I had never taken statistics prior to this course and had no trouble understanding the concepts. This is not to say I didn't learn anything--multiple regression, which you cover late in the course, is a useful subject and Prof. Parzen gives many real-life examples. If you have more time or the interest in statistics, I would recommend looking at Stat 110","This course is not a joke as some people falsely claim. It is an excellent introduction to statistics.","Even though the exams are open-book, take the time to study and go over ideas. And go to Professor Parzen's office hours - he is very helpful, takes the time to help, and is just a great guy!","Not as easy as you think or have been told, especially if you've never taken statistics.","This class is great if you put in the work. Go to section!","This class is pretty easy, as long as you go to lecture and try to understand the material. Definitely go to section because its really helpful, especially if Amy is still a TF!","This a solid class with fantastic instruction. Take it!","For the open-notes midterm and final, it will be helpful to take notes beforehand instead of just having all the lecture slides.\r\nThis class is not too hard.","People say this course is easy -- it is only easy if you put the time required into it.  I had never taken any sort of statistics course before (high school or college) so I found that I had a lot to learn.  Also, the exams are open note, but you WILL run out of time if you do not know the material.","This course is, as advertised, not the most rigorous of stat\/math classes available at Harvard. However, it's definitely not a total blow-off class either.","The class taught me a lot about how to use stats but did not really teach me much about why the methods we used actually work.","It's simple and not too difficult. Take it","Stat 104 is what it is rumored to be. Easy and yet informative. Go to lecture and stay up to speed with the class. Lectures are fun, and nothing is worse than making a straightforward class difficult because you ditch class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Stat 104 is definitely not a hard course. It teaches a lot of concepts at a basic levels ad you really won't see any problems that will throw you off at first glance. With that said, however, I would not say that it is a useless course because, if you have not seen stats before, it will definitely teach you useful skills. Take it!","Great course. Lots of support. Easy to catch on with no prior statistics background.","This can be an easy fourth of fifth class for someone who needs to take statistics for an ec, gov, or life sciences\/pre med concentration. Very introductory, in the sense that cool things are covered but you don't go into great depth.  Even though it's easy, you should still dedicate yourself to psets and understanding the concepts.  Do the practice finals religiously and you'll do well.  Don't take this class for granted, even though it will probably be your least difficult class.","Parzen is hilarious and the course is very manageable in terms of the work. There is only one pset a week and office hours are very useful.","One of the most valuable and painless classes you will ever take at Harvard.","It is not as easy as everyone says it is if you don't have any sort of background in Stats. That said, its still pretty easy and you don't have to go to lectures or sections. Buy the course packets because you will use them during the exams. (i used the study guide the least though). Do the Past Exams and you'll be set for the Final.","I originally took this course, still thinking that I wanted to be an economics concentrator. By about a month into the second semester, I knew that I'd definitely be pursuing the humanities instead (not because of stat 104, just in general). However, I'm able to get Stat 104 credit for my global health secondary, so it all worked out.  I wouldn't let not being an econ person scare you away from taking this course.  Having had no experience with statistics whatsoever, it was a well-paced introduction.  The psets can feel a bit repetitive, but they're only once a week, so it's not too bad. I really found going to section useful, because once in a while something would be mentioned that didn't come up in lecture, plus you work through sample problems that are very similar to the psets.","Don't take this class because it's 'easy' - take it because it's well-taught and made accessible to anyone, not just math concentrators, through a combination of respectful teaching and well-planned lessons.","This class is pretty easy- I learned alot. You just have to stay on top of everything week by week (aka do the problem sets).","This class is awesome.  Professor Parzen is hilarious (ever email he sent us made me chuckle) and the class is soooo easy.  I loved learning how to use Stata and understand the applications that I could make with what I learned.  Some people might say it's hard, but that's probably cause they didn't ever go to lecture or section.  Just go to lecture, copy his notes on your own copy of the lecture slides, and do the practice tests before the midterm\/final, and you'll be totally fine.  Open notes for the tests are great.","This is a great course to take to learn about statistical analysis","This is a great class that isn't too difficult. The curve is generous and lectures and sections are optional (with the lectures taped) so you wont have to spend a lot of your time on this class. You learn a lot of interesting and useful things about statistics. I would definitely recommend this class.","This class is great and you can do well without going to section or lecture. However I would go to lecture once in a while because Parzen is amazing! The project is really lowkey but you learn a lot. One of my favorite classes I've ever taken. I think everyone should take Stat 104.","The class is not super easy, but its worth your time, and if you do go to lecture, Parzen's pretty funny.","Easy if you have taken stats, but keep up with the lectures if you haven't!","You don't need any background in stat for this class, but if you haven't taken any statistics before (like me), go in expecting that everyone else has taken AP stat. Most of the other students have preparation with the material, so just expect it to be a bit harder for you, and you'll adjust accordingly and do well. Parzen's lectures are entertaining and very helpful, so try to go. And section is also very helpful (I had Andy, the head TF). Be sure to check over psets with friends, because while they're not too tough, if you make a bunch of silly numerical errors, it adds up and it's pretty easy to check over. Lastly, take advantage of the course materials that Parzen and others have developed. The study guide booklet has extra questions based on topics, so if you have weaknesses, you can easily target them. Take a bunch of practice exams before the midterm and final. Oh, and going in to Parzen's office hours if you ever have questions (I did this before the exams) is very helpful because he can tell you what exactly you need to know or not know to do well. He is upfront and cares about the students.","It is very fair and interesting.","Very fair class. Fairly straightforward, but very useful material as well.","A straightforward course, but be sure to understand the p-sets and concepts before the midterm and final.  Don't put off the final project either, it's an easy way to get points.","I've never taken a statistics class before, but I still found this class to be incredibly easy. Go to lecture and section, even though these may seem like optional components to the course. Section pretty much goes over how to do the homework. Homework problems are easy and can be done independently. If you are struggling in the course, the study support network is fantastic. The class is so large that the TFs are constantly holding office hours.","Go to lecture!","Minimal work; but be warned, if you sit back and absorb nothing for the entire class (which is really easy to do), the exams are terrifying.","super easy, fifth class workload","This is a great intro to statistics.","STAT 104 is a very good class that is streamlined to make the material as accessible for you as possible!","This class is not very much work and Parzen is hilarious. It is an overview of statistics and teaches you how to analyze data sets, but does not go much into why those analysis methods work. Do the practice tests and get a good group for the final project. And if he's still teaching, go to Enzo's sections and get his study guides.","The psets can get a little tedious and repetitive and the exams are quite challenging.","Section is a gem. Go to section!!!","Very good class. Useful tools to learn with Stata and such. Parzen is a boss.","easy. just show up to class and pay attention. it's actually pretty interesting and applicable","This class was amazing!","Very solid introduction to statistics, and Parzen is just too funny.","Study hard and do your best.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the final project, making your own survey and collecting sufficient data is likely to give you some weird results","This course is a good introduction to statistics. If you took AP Stats in high school, it will be a piece of cake, but if you didn't, be prepared to watch lectures online\/actually go to class, which the majority of people don't do. Psets are only due once a week, and are usually pretty easy, and the final and midterm are open book-open notes. The final project is where you actually apply everything you learned, and if you have a good group and a good project, it can be a really rewarding experience.","it is a good intro to statistics. Learning stata is a good thing to put on a resume. And its a pretty easy class if you just put in a little time.","You cannot justify using a Harvard credit for this course unless you're taking at least 5 classes. This course is an absolute joke. The exams are open book, open note, open everything, but they're still curved so that a C is an A-. If you do decide to take this course, watch the lectures online on 2x speed so it seems like the material is being covered at a reasonable pace. Far easier than AP Stat and somewhat of an embarrassment for a Harvard course.","Not too hard and very interesting knowledge","This is a flawlessly run course. Lectures that are perfectly paced in person or on videos uploaded right away, sections and office hours whenever students decide it would be helpful to their own learning to attend them, frequent communication and incredibly personalized help from the exuberant professor, a clear and helpful class website -- it doesn't get better than this if you're looking for a class that lets you choose how you learn rather than forcing material down your throat, and still comes out teaching you quite a lot.","This course is super doable, and Parzen is hilarious. If you have any reason to know just a little bit about statistics, take this course.","Even though the exams are open-note, open-book, make sure to study still. Also, go to lectures.","Go to section-- it will make your life extremely easy.","Really easy.","Statistics 104 is a large and interesting lecture course with a low-stress atmosphere, but be sure not to take the material too lightly. Study consistently, even if you took AP Statistics in high school, because the exams will be tough if you are not prepared.  The final project can be fun and rewarding, particularly if you work with your friends.  Take this class in order to gain practical skills in statistical analysis that will serve you well in internships, employment, and everyday common sense!","Stay on top of your work -- it's easy not to go to class, but the tests are hard if you get behind on the material.","It is a good class and if you go to class and take notes and do your p sets, it should be easy when the test comes.  This class was also fun.","Fun class, especially if you take it with a group of friends. Is manageable and the staff give you everything you need to do well - they truly want you to succeed in this class. Make sure to apply yourself on the psets instead of relying on other people to explain everything to you, otherwise you won't learn the material.","Great class","This is a course that's useful for those who may have taken AP Statistics, but the large class size makes it difficult to learn at times.","Homework takes slightly longer than expected, but the support structure in this class is incredible. There are always office hours, Prof. Parzen is accommodating, the tests aren't too bad, and you'll learn quite a bit. Should be a requirement for all to get a basic understanding of how the numbers we see\/read throughout the day are obtained.","Parzen was hilarious--his jokes alone almost make the class worth taking.  Also, all the lectures were taped, the sections were optional, and the PSETs were completely manageable (there's a reason this is known as one of the easiest classes at Harvard).  However, don't try learn all the material before the night of the exam, even if it's open note.  Or maybe you can, but if that's what you're going to do, I wish you luck.","Do the work, go to section and you will do great","This course is a great start to statistics.","If you have taken AP stats, you have basically already taken this course.","go to class do homework","it's no longer as easy as it once was","You will love it!","This class is not as easy as everyone makes it out to be.  Granted that I'm not the most comfortable in math\/science classes, but I do think that this is a difficult class.  The class concepts are not as easy to grasp...","This is a good fourth class if you are taking three moderate to difficult other classes. That is how I used it and I was very grateful for it, being able to fulfil requirements and learn intro Statistics while not wreaking too much stress on the already Harvardian weekly schedule. Also a lot of fun with a funny lecturer who made me come to lecture even when I didn't really need to go to learn the concepts.","You should take Stat 104 for either of two reasons: 1) You have never been exposed to basic Statistics before, but are interesting in having some knowledge of it or 2) You have been exposed to Statistics, but you want a review combined with a course that is relatively easy\/low stress when you have other difficult classes to worry about. However, you should know that in the case of 2), the course is quite easy and trivial and will not provide challenge and\/or excitement.","Statistics using a lot of Stata, rather than doing work by hand.","It's an easy class. But the material and lectures are so boring that it makes the course painful.","Great intro to stat course, no background in stat necessary.","go to class- it makes it way easier to learn the material and it isnt that bad","The class is very fulfilling if you put the effort into it. If you do not, then you will not learn much. With that said, you can get through the course with simply using STATA (the computer program stat104 uses), but to REALLY understand the material, you must review the slides and connect the conceptual things to the homework. Professor Parzen goes through lecture and topics very very fast, so you must put in extra time if you want the most out of the class.","Easy af","Lecture was entertaining and to the point. Dr. Parzen is bawss. Also, the course really is as easy as it's made out to be. I wouldn't say it's a problem when I can habitually start a pset due at 4 on Friday at 3 on that same Friday, but they clearly could move faster and cover more material. I had never taken a stats course before, never attended section, and I'm not especially good with numbers, but the psets were absurdly easy and I got nearly all 5s out of 5 without much effort. Having said all that, I definitely learned a lot of practical and interesting statistics stuff. Basically, take this course if you're interested in getting started with stats and\/or want an easy course.","Great course. Great material. A little slow.","This class is great. The lectures are entertaining, the material is very easy and relevant. You won't spend much time on your work for this class.","This class is really what you make of it. You can get through the class doing the psets last minute, but you may not come away with a real understanding of what the various aspects of the course are about. Don't take the course for granted, because you can really take away a lot from it and get a solid knowledge of basic statistics that can help you in the future. Overall the class isn't terribly difficult, but don't underestimate it! Just because the midterm and final are open note doesn't mean you can get away without studying and being unprepared. If you do bring notes in (and you should), make sure to consolidate and organize them beforehand. Also Parzen is hilarious and a good lecturer, and the TFs are good overall.","hard even though people say its easy, long psets","Take this class! A very low-stress but useful class that gives a solid foundation in statistics, though not very representative of what the actual field of statistics is like.","Really solid, not too difficult intro to Stat. Parzen's entertaining as a lecturer, and you can do perfectly well without going to lecture much. You'll be happy you took it.","I found the sections for this course very helpful, especially when doing the homework. Lecture teaches the concepts, but sections teaches you to apply the concepts. Also, take advantage of offices hours. This class is very manageable if you don't get behind on lectures.","Hardest part is sifting through all the tangential slides for useful concepts\/equations (just took the final\u00e2\u20ac\u201cstill can't tell you what a standard deviation is, exactly...). Homework is mind-numbingly tedious. But Parzen is hilarious, and the class probably is the best intro to stats\/Stata here.","Great class, interesting material.","This class is not a joke. You need to do a very good job on the problem sets to get full credit. The midterm and final are hard. The midterm mostly because you will not have enough time if you do not know how to do each question immediately. That said, the skills learned in this class are so relevant and necessary no matter what you plan to do with your life, I think it should be required of all undergraduates.","This class is very interesting if you haven't learned stat and very manageable. The TFs are great, very well-prepared, so I would recommend going to section even if it is optional, they help with the psets. Also, go to lecture! It really make the course that much better because you enjoy Parzen's jokes, if you have a tough semester ahead of you, I recommend taking up stat as a class because it doesn't require too much work.","Review concepts regularly","Stat 104 with Parzen is a great class for anyone. Take it for any reason.","Parzen is great and helpful; take the course, you gain a skill set you need-- especially true for humanities concentrators","Very good class -- put in some work, pay attention, and you will do well. Parzen is a great lecturer and you do learn a lot of applicable skills.","I think anyone learning stat across any concentration to all go to STAT 104.  You get so much support and feedback with endless practice exams and studyguides to look at.","Class is pretty good\/easy but you need to put work in on your own to get a good grade. The TFs know the material but don't know the class so they don't all know what exactly you need to know and not know.","Take this class.","Take if you are interested in stats and want to take more stats, but aren't comfortable skipping it and going straight to a harder stat class.","I'm an English major and wanted some stat experience. This was a really great class - I learned a lot and it wasn't too difficult!","Statistics is becoming the way of the world. Everyone needs to take this course! You learn a lot and it is actually an enjoyable experience.","This course is very straight-forward.","People need to stop saying this course is easy; it's straightforward. It's not difficult either though, it just requires time invested into it. Just watch the lectures online and you'll do fine.","Be disciplined and don't safe everything for the last minute... because it's easy to do that","Everyone (ok, almost everyone) will most probably tell you this is one of the easiest Harvard classes. Unless you have some background in Statistics don't believe them at once! If seriously, some background would be really useful. If you don't have it, don't worry! Just be ready it may not always be a piece of cake. But definitely this IS one of the most rewarding Harvard classes; you learn a lot, I mean, a lot!","This is a great class. Professor Parzen is really a great teacher and so funny, kind, helpful, and intelligent. It gives a great basis for statistics and doesn't require too much work, but it is still very applicable to the real world and gives a lot of really great information.","Very easy class. Great to take senior spring. I did not attend a single lecture, and I believe I was easily able to do well.","This is a great class","fun. take it","Take this if you've never taken stats before and don't want to learn real, rigorous stats in any way.  Basically, if you're actually interested in stats, don't take this.","If you need to take a statistics course or a math course whether for a concentration or ten-ed requirement, take this class!! Though it does require effort and work and time (don't listen to the reviews that say this class is no work, is a joke, etc, it's not!) it is extremely manageable and with the right work it is easy enough to get an A. As far as math\/stats classes go this is also one of the most straightforward ones. Professor Parzen is hilarious and the TFs are also great (try to section into Sebastian's or Enzo's!!!) and they all have ample office hours to help with any questions you may have.","Don't underestimate the course. It's fairly straightforward and homeworks and exams are not that hard but you will still have to put in some effort. Prof. Parzen is great at delivering the material, even though we spent half of every lecture talking about random stuff. \r\nSection attendance is REALLY voluntary, I haven't been to my section once, but I've gone to other TF's sections a few times before the midterm\/final. The professor and TF's provide a lot of OH, and although they tend to get a bit overcrowded before exams, it's a great opportunity to learn. Overall, I'd say take the course if you want a laid back introduction to Stats or if you're considering taking more stat courses in the future and want to see if you will like it (I'm definitely taking Stat 110 next year).","Don't completely blow this class off or you will be sorry at the final","It is really manageable and useful.","homework can sometimes be a little tricky if you don't go to class.","Go to Section! It makes the PSETs so much easier!","i would recoment it bc (i) others enjoyed it, even though I didn't, and (ii) it's important stuff to learn","Easy as long as you stay on top of the lectures and psets!","Not a rewarding course","Take this class to fulfill the math requirement while also learning some very useful aspects of stat that will be applicable regardless of what you decide to concentrate in.","The level of difficulty of this class is inversely related to the strength of your basic algebra skills. Know your linear equations and be comfortable with using certain algebraic formulas that appear. Also be good with percents\/decimals\/fractions, and with reading questions carefully (lots of places to slip up on the exams.)\r\nThe course is rumored to have its curriculum revamped very soon (fall 2013, maybe), ie., made more challenging; carefully consider your basic math (stuff before pre-calc) skills\/background when choosing your stats course (and math courses in general).","If you've never taken statistics before, this class is not as easy as some people may claim. Be sure to give yourself enough time for the problem sets (there can be some tricky problems) and the final project (which takes more time than you might guess).","This class is amazing. It is a great introductory class and a staple freshmen course to take. I highly recommend it whether or not you need statistics for your concentration.","This class is fairly easy!","Such a great class! Parzen is hilarious and wants to see his students to do well.","Amazing course. Really helps people understand the basics behind statistics.","Gives you a great understanding of basic statistics! And it's really not too hard for something so valuable and interesting","It's a good, not-so-difficult class, but you do learn a good amount of knowledge, so it is worth it if you don't have much knowledge of Stat.","Go to section.","All the materials you could need are available.  Office hours like 24\/7.  Applicable material. great.","I didn't find stat 104 as easy as everyone else seemed to. A lot of the people that take this course have already taken AP stat, so of course they find it very easy. If you're like me and you're not very math\/logic minded AND you haven't taken AP stat, don't think that it will be a piece of cake. Also, the psets don't take very long, but they also don't really prepare you for exams so make sure you actually study for those.","This course is the perfect blend of easy and informative.  Although a lot of people view it as a throwaway class, and I certainly did when I signed up, by the time I took the final I was actually pretty impressed with how much I'd learned.  Parzen is really entertaining in lecture, and even though I'm sure actually going to lecture isn't necessary I went because it was a nice break in my day.  I didn't buy any of the course packs and just took handwritten notes, and these were perfectly sufficient.  The psets are super painless--a couple hours one night per week at most, and they're so mindless that you can listen to music or do something else while you're doing them.  If you need to balance a couple hard classes, this course is perfect for that.","This is a great class to fulfill a basic statistic requirement. Parzen is engaging and very funny. You can learn everything you need to understand the material in lecture, so section isn't necessary, but if you want to go to section or office hours they are very convenient.","If you took AP Stat don't bother.\r\nUnless you need to for concentration requirement.\r\nParzen is the man and all, but the class itself is pretty useless - I didn't learn anything that I didn't learn in (and remember 4 years later) in AP Stat in high school.","Stat 104 will prepare you for just about anything. It is extremely manageable if you are organized, and Parzen is hilarious.","You learn a lot. It's easy. What else can you ask for in a class?","Parzen is fun and though he communicates a \"don't care\" attitude, he really does care and makes an effort to make a connection with students. I found that I didn't learn anything in lecture but did most of my learning through psets and studying for exams, which seems a bit of a waste of 3 hours every week. Sections may depend on how good your TF is, but you are free to go to other TF's sections. Overall, I'm really glad I took this course. An intro statistics class is very valuable for getting a sense of how relevant, useful and important it is in all career fields.","take","Dr. Parzen is actually a wonderful teacher of statistics, and in addition to joking around and having fun with the class, he is extremely helpful in office hours and outside of class. I would really recommend this course to anyone who is even remotely interested in statistics; it will definitely make you even more excited about statistics.","Wonderful course; intuitive and pretty manageable","Parzen is an enthusiastic lecturer. There is a lot to be gained from the class. It's not as easy as everyone says, but definitely straightforward.","Definitely take this class- Parzen is awesome and you will not mind attending\/watching lecture because he jokes around with the class and keeps stat entertaining.","This class is great. Interesting content and great teaching staff.","You'll learn a lot and it won't be too difficult\/too much of a struggle","It's a good course to get requirements done: it fulfills a Gen Ed and a lot of concentrations have a Stat requirement. With that said, it's not exactly the course to take if you actually want a good introduction to statistics (110 is probably better). Stat 104 is really straightforward and doesn't ask much of the student.","This class is quite easy, but you do learn quite a bit.","A super fun way to get a basic introduction to stat. I feel like I learned a lot of really useful information and I'm going to remember it. Plus Parzen is a great lecturer, and you don't have to go to section.","This class was great. Lecture was incredibly entertaining and informative. I actually really liked learning and applying the material. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this class. GO TO LECTURE.","this class is possibly one of the most convenient classes you'll take at Harvard. the material is presented clearly, Parzen's lectures are pretty funny, and the lectures are posted online the same day, so you can watch them in the evenings if you prefer. as far as fulfilling requirements goes, this class is relatively harmless.","If you like p-sets and not having to do much else, this is the class for you","I think that it is great class to take. It gives you a nice basic understanding on how to interpret  statistical models which is needed and appreciated.","This stuff will change the way you think. You can't say that about a lot of classes, but you will be a more useful person if you understand how to use and explain statistics. Take it.","This is the most straight forward course I have taken so far. The material is well-explained and Parzen does a great job connecting it to real world problems. Overall the course is very flexible to any student's learning techniques and schedule.","Just take it if you need an extra class.","Be prepared to learn on your own. There is not much teaching going on in this class.","This is an easy class and one that should be taken with friends becayse of the group projects","This class is the best way to learn statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is enjoyable and teaches you the material effectively.","Solid, relatively easy course. You will get a good overview of basic statistics.","Great class covering very useful material for future work.","Although people say it is an easy course, do not underestimate it. Take time to review and study.","This was the best large lecture course I've taken at Harvard. If you are willing to show up and ask for it, the teaching staff if there to give you help. But do not underestimate this course from the first few lectures! Some of it is really simple, and some of it takes a while to wrap your head around conceptually. Make sure to put in the time to review the concepts frequently, or the course can really get out of control quickly. The homework does not help you do this, so you have to take the time to read notes, review lecture slides, etc. If you do, it all comes together-- I did poorly on the midterm because I underestimated it, but when I started taking it seriously it was fine.","Willam Chen's sections are fantastic! And Professor Parzen's a great lecturer. This class really grew on me in the end. :)","This class is easier than AP Stat, but it's actually pretty interesting. Learning to use Stata is fun and useful, and Parzen is probably one of the best teachers you'll ever get the opportunity to learn from.","Make sure to keep up with all of the homework assignments and lectures; if you miss a lecture, make sure you rewatch it as soon as you can.","This class is not very difficult, but if you are struggling, there are a number of resources available for help. Parzen is a funny lecturer and makes a lot of jokes, but he knows what he is talking about. Overall, the lectures were worthwhile.","A great class to get introduced to basic statistics!","Just pay attention during lecture (or when watching online) and this course will be a breeze. I'm horrible at math, stat 104 will likely be my online math course at Harvard, and I found this course to be very manageable and accessible.","I highly enjoyed this class. Parzen was hilarious, and his humor made me want to come to class again and again. This course basically provides no pressure. You don't have to go to section, and the homework is pretty simple. The exams are also all open-book (but you still need to study!). As long as you put in a reasonable amount of work, you should be able to do very well in this course.","It's great!","This is a good class that meets a gen-ed and is low-stress.","Don't underestimate the midterm, but the rest of the course is what you've heard about it.","This is a great course and I would definitely recommend it.","parzen's humour and belittling of almost everything are the spoonful of sugar that make stats go down with less resistance.  well organized, psets took me all night though.","When people say Stat 104 is easy, what they actually mean is that lectures are lighthearted and psets will take significantly less time than most for other classes. You will still fail if you don't take things seriously, so don't underestimate the course due to its reputation- it's still a real course and requires you to stay on top of the material.","Take it! It'll be pretty painless!","This class is enjoyable.","Take the class! It's no work if you just watch the lectures online (saves you like 30 minutes) and go to section. Section is VERY helpful. The tests are open book, the psets aren't hard, and the material is useful so just take it. And parzen is hilarious so that helps too.","It is a great class if you want a broad overview to Statistics and different tests that can be used in order to determine relationships between different variables. It's great that it's taught at a difficulty level such that it is accessible to people of may different quantitative-levels.","This class is very straightforward - no tricks or surprises. You learn the fundamentals of statistics and apply it to some economical concepts.","This is generally a very easy class. However, if quantitative stuff is not your thing make sure you prepare for the midterm and the final exam. The problems you'll find are very different from the psets. Also, if you feel you need to go to section to better understand the material, make sure to find a great TF by trying different sections at the beginning of the year and asking around. Get good partners for the project.","This class is useful to learn Stata but don't expect to be too intellectually stimulating.","make sure you go to lecture, office hours and sections and this will be the least stressful class you ever took at harvard","Gem.","Take this course. I am not kidding take this course. It is a must take at Harvard.","Go to lecture and take many notes and go to section","This course doesn't take too much time, but will still teach you quite a bit about statistics and the basic statistical concepts you see in the news. If you haven't taken statistics, this class will prove very useful in the future as you encounter some of these concepts every day.","Enjoyable lectures, organized curriculum, and reasonable demands. Definitely a worthwhile experience.","Very well taught class which teaches basic statistical analysis skills which are largely applicable to many different fields.","Yes","This class is really easy. You don't have to (aren't expected to) go to lecture or section. The material teaches itself.","This is the best class you can choose for that blank spot on your study card.","Great class to take to round out the end of your freshman year. Very manageable workload. Extremely easy exams.","Statistics 104 is the great course ever made. It is a blessing. It is a gift. I am a person who hates math, who is terrified of math, who sits at home and night and has nightmares about math coming to eat me. And yet, Statistics 104 was a fantastic course that taught me everything I needed to know to feel smart and comfortable with statistics. Professor Parzen understands people like me (and possibly you) who are scared of math. He gets it, and the course is designed to help every person learn the material. You'd have to try to not learn it. I loved this class so much, and was very grateful to it for teaching me the skills that I failed to acquire in typical math courses. While doing a problem set, I was able to clarify for myself something that I had not understood in lecture, which I view as the greatest accomplishment of a pset. I could go on praising this class forever, but basically, if you need a stat class (or a gened in math)  take this course. You won't regret it. Not possible.","Stat 104 is your foundational statistics class. It does a good job of teaching you the basics of statistics, no prior knowledge needed.","If you care about statistics you should probably take a more difficult statistics class.","You actually use the stuff that you learn in class!","I would tell them to go to sections because they really do help a lot!!","Take it! Parzen is awesome, and it's really easy.","Great intro to stat","Should probably be a required course for all undergraduates. That said, it needs a greater emphasis on conceptual\/mathematical understandings, rather than plug-and-chug. The pre-consulting or pre-finance emphasis was particularly irritating.","The course is very easy, fulfills all sorts of pre-med or concentration requirements, and is bound to have some friends in it. Take it. You may very well fall in love with stat. Once you learn how to manipulate Stata, problem sets almost become fun. Lecture doesn't feel like lecture - despite the large lecture hall, it feels very intimate. Parzen is extremely engaging and charming, so lecture feels like a conversation in which you happen to be learning some things.","I really enjoyed this course and learning Stata was fun!","This class is very simple and easy, but you'll learn a lot.","Relatively easy course where you learn a fair amount.","If you are an economics concentrator, you have to take it. It's not a stressful class but it can be annoying because the professor doesn't really take it seriously so it's hard to take it seriously yourself until you don't understand the problem set, then you take it seriously.","This class is probably the best introduction to statistics at Harvard.","Great course, will teach you the fundamental skills to analyze and interpret all types of data.","Take it to fill a requirement and as an easy fourth class. Seriously don't pair it with too many other kind of easy classes and definitely not with a freshman seminar. You'll be bored out fo your mind.","This is a great course to sample statistics. I think it does a good job of introducing the subject and immersing you in it.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you don't wanna waste your time.","Great into to stat.  Proves a course does not have to be extremely challenging to be extremely helpful.  I learned a ton and I loved that the course focused on concrete applications to the real world.  Also, this course is an incredibly well-oiled machine - extremely well run which made being in the class a pleasure.","Take the class. Easy A\/A-.","It's a chill 5th class, but it's really not all that rigorous. What you put in is what you'll get out.","This course is great","Great introduction to statistics in regard to the financial world. Parzen's lectures are hilarious and reason enough to take this class. The psets and exams are very straight-forward, but be warned, you do have to put some time into this class. While if you put the work in it's relatively easy to come out with a good grade, don't expect as many do to coast the whole semester and do well.","This class is great. Even if you don't need stat 104 for anything, take it as a fifth class.","It's a great class that teaches you a lot more than you think. If you work hard and do the homeworks, you will have a great grasp on the material.","The exams are pretty hard, so try to understand the material as you go along.","Although lecture is optional, if you don't attend make sure you keep up on watching videos and don't fall behind or your understanding will suffer and problem sets will be much more difficult.","This class is a good introduction to statistics.  Parzen is an awesome lecturer and there is TONS of support for students who are struggling (sections, office hours, and study networks basically all day Wednesday & Thursday before psets are due Friday).  I took the class as a senior humanities concentrator for my EMR gened and found it enjoyable and not too difficult.","All you need to do to succeed in this class is watch the lectures at 2x speed on your computer, do the psets, and study for a few hours for the exams and it'll be a breeze.","Take only if you are actually interested in statistics.","Statistics is useful! It requires time but it's worth it.","Take it! Professor is awesome and my TF was great.","Although the course has a reputation for being \"easy,\" you still need to put in effort to do well in the class. Attend lectures and sections as much as possible, complete all of the psets, study for the exams, and put in a lot of time into the project.","The fact that this class was supposed to be \"easy\" made me do everything at the minimum level and at the last minute, and detracted from my experience. Yeah, I probably got an A without trying very hard, but I missed out on a lot of learning by skipping lecture and section. You get what you give, and since Parzen and the TFs are actually very friendly and knowledgeable it's just a good idea to put more into the class, because it's useful stuff that's worth learning well.","It's an entertaining and informative class","This class has changed a lot in the last few years. The school told the professor to make it harder, so he made the psets really long and tedious and repetitive (literally asking the same question 3 times but you still have to do the calculations for each one). The assignments ended up overlapping with a lot of my other work, though going into the class I thought the psets would be easy like last year so I didn't anticipate this being a problem. The midterm was easy if you studied, but the professor kind of lied about what would be on the final and it ended up being deceptively hard.","Favorite course of Freshman year!","This class was satisfying in the way that you felt like you really understood and got to use what you learned in the problem sets and exams. There was nothing tricky or hard - it was straightforward and generally fun.","This is one of the best classes at Harvard by far. Parzen keeps lectures very enjoyable and the course material is very very helpful no matter what you are studying. The teaching staff really want the students to excel and this keeps the class very low pressure but still effective.","Parzen is a good lecturer.  Easy class but you learn a lot and become a better problem solver and critical thinker. Good class!","If you do all the work and watch the lectures you'll be fine!","awesome","Don't wait until the last minute to do the final project","Many people will tell you how easy this class is, and it's true that it is straightforward, BUT be careful not to think it's so easy that you need not spend ANY time on it! Many people got caught up in the idea that they didn't need to study at all because the exams are open book and they can just look all the answers up. As you can imagine, they did very poorly. This is not meant to scare you... the material IS straightforward but, like anything, if you don't go to class and spend literally no time learning it, it will not feel so straightforward. If you do the work (which really isn't very much) and go to class\/section, you will do very well in this class.","Maybe I'm just terrible at math, but I didn't find this course as easy as everyone had said it would be. I was expected a real gut, and it wasn't that. But I still learned a good deal, and despite some obvious flaws in the course, it's worth taking.","Do all of the psets and the old exams.","The material is straightforward but you need to stay on top of the work. It's pretty simple. Just psets, a midterm, a final project, and a final. Great class. Go to section\/office houses for questions.","Although this class has a reputation for being easy, don't blow off classes or homework. Also, make sure you are prepared for the midterm and final, which you might be tempted not to do since they are open-book. However, just having the notes in front of you isn't enough, you should already be familiar with how to do the calculations.","It's pretty easy, but you do have to care a little bit.  Compile a formula chart and know when to utilize them.","Keep up with the lectures. Regression analysis towards the end of the course can be really fun!","This is a great course.","The grading is much harder than expected be wary.","this is an easy class if you're math geared. if not, it requires patience and a lot of work (especially on psets). however, Parzen and the TFs all want us to do well!","Very straightforward course with a hilarious but effective professor.","Fantastic, but don't underestimate workload based on what you hear from other students. It still requires attention and focus consistently","It was a waste of time, but a good 4th filler class if you need one","not the most interesting class, and very easy to fall behind in. However good grades seem to be frequently just given out with the large grading scale.","This class was honestly a waste of my time. Parzen was an excellent lecturer and was extremely available outside of class - however, the structure and aim of the course was terrible.  All I learned was the right codes to plug into Stata to get the results necessary. Attendance to class was useless and unnecessary. I really wouldn't recommend.","Great class! Learned a lot Professor Parzen is funny too!","TAKE IT. SO WORTH IT.","Don't think twice, perfect fifth class.","Take this class seriously. Although it may not seem very difficult from lectures, problem sets, and sections, the exams will be challenging if you don't put time into learning the material.","Don't be worried about your math skills - this is truly not a math course. There are some people in this class who probably took statistics AP when they were in high school, and this is going to be easy for them. But if you're not one of those people, you can still excel. If you go to class and section, you will never feel lost or like the material is beyond you.","I liked this course. I would have loved it if I were a freshman. But I am a senior who is just so jaded and ready to leave. I'm so tired of people giving me BS midterms and making me feel bad about myself. But I liked this course and professor Parzen. I was just ready to GTFO.","Fantastic class, not stressful but high informative. Be ready to ask your TF questions as soon as you're confused because concepts carry through. Also take the final project seriously, it's bigger than it looks.","Prof. Parzen is an entertaining and gripping lecturer. Course is stimulating and interesting.","This class is a good introduction to statistics and it isn't very difficult at all. Keep in mind though that it isn't exactly an accurate representation of what stat concentrators study in the future!","The material is useful and you will learn it; however, you could teach yourself all of the material in a short amount of time. The class is super easy, though.","good easy gen ed\/math class","Stat 104 is an amazing class! Stats is relevant to almost every field you could go into, because it's crucial for research. Professor Parzen makes it enjoyable, and you walk away learning a lot. Take the class, you won't regret it!","This is a really good gen ed or math requirement, but remember that even though exams are open-book, you do need to know the material fairly well. Also keep in mind that there is a final project that you can't wait until the last minute to do. I highly recommend taking this course as an into to stat, and this is coming from a person who had never taken stat before.","Just because it's senior spring...doesn't mean you shouldn't engage with this class. That being said...I wish I had went to more lectures because Parzen is a great lecturer and Parzen in 3x isn't quite as fun. x","Even though it's supposed to be an easy intro course and people say to take it if you don't like math, take this class with a grain of salt. I took AP Stats in high school and I found myself drawing on that knowledge a little too often. The class goes to fast through difficult concepts and if I didn't have prior exposure to these ideas I would have fallen behind so hard. One good thing about the course though is the large number of resources available! Sections and study networks almost every hour every day, lots of one on one help is available and that's great.","Very straightforward class. The professor makes lectures really fun.","Everyone should take this class. The material itself is invaluable and necessary to understand other fields, especially economics and biology, and implications thereof more clearly. However, the class as a whole is very clear and manageable (coming from someone who is NOT math-oriented or quantitatively minded). Take it! It's fun.","This class was very easy. Professor Parzen does a good job of communicating topics, but he goes off on tangents a great deal; with most professors, this can be fun, but I for one did not enjoy the professor's lectures a great deal. Know your Stata commands, and when to use each formula!","Minimal work load (psets took less than an hour\/week), lecture was amusing, section is optional.","Good course!  Not too much work and very informative","This class will provide you with a solid background in statistics, and the lectures are pretty entertaining, considering the material.","Always watch the lecture videos if you don't go to lecture.  You need them.","Take it","Parzen can sometimes dismiss things as being easy, but there's a difference between straightforward and easy. Although problems on the midterm are straightforward, they're not easy and do require studying. Typically people take stat 104 as an easy buffer class, but be prepared to not have enough time on the midterm and exam, which do have surprisingly low averages.","Study for it, it is not a joke","TAKE IT YO!!","Go to the lectures and pay attention, they are really helpful","Though the class isn't too difficult, it does exactly what it sets out to do in that it covers the fundamentals of statistics, and covers them well.","If you dont stay up on the material, it is hard to cram at the end.","Parzen is the man","This class is easy on the condition you actually take the time to understand the material.  While it may be considered a joke class, the mean on the midterm was lower for a reason.  If you do your psets early and go to office hours you'll learn so much more.  Lecture is completely optional and I know many people do not go to section--but you really do learn from the psets.","This class is definitely not as easy as its reputation makes it seem. I have a strong math background (although I have never done stats), and there were parts I found difficult. Psets are not too bad, and you can usually finish the night before if necessary. Open note\/book midterm helps a bit. The project can be tough; pick good partners (not really specific about how it is graded). The class itself is pretty good. Parzen is a fun professor, but sometimes it can get old. The class is really big, so it is almost like a show. Still, it is interesting and you should take it to learn about stats. Much of the stuff you learn is relevant to jobs later in life.","Definitely the best option for an intro stat class! If you have the choice, take it! It's pretty unlikely that you'll find another prof on this campus willing to organize a sledding trip on blizzard days...","Great class.","I took AP Stat in high school and found the course very manageable. Parzen's clear and straightforward, there is SO much help available, great course.","This class is a gem - but only if you stay on top of the work!! Make sure you take advantage of study networks. TF's hold office hours to help you with homework, and it's seriously the best and easiest way to get your homework done really fast and to understand the material.","It's not really an engaging class, becomes perfunctory after a while. Work is generally easy and there is little motivation to go above and beyond with anything.","Relatively easy, Parzen is funny as heck!","This is a great class that will teach you basic statistics that everyone should know. It will also teach you how to use Stata, which is incredibly useful. The class is also easy, so it's not a source of stress during your semester.","Even though lectures were essentially optional, I went to every single one because Parzen was such an entertaining lecturer!","Don't take this as a joke class! It requires actual thought and engagement to do well so don't go into it assuming you can put zero effort in!","This is a relatively easy class which you can get a lot out of. People tend to slack off, but if you keep up week-to-week it is actually very helpful. Some of my friends want to get secondaries in Stat after taking this course.","Don't take the class if you like personal connection or are not a \"math person\" This course is not as easy as it is billed to be. The overwhelming size was intimidating and made the material less accessible than it could have been. That said, Parzen is very funny, and if you are good at working entirely independently, you should do decently.","Stat 104 has gotten harder over the years, so expect to put in a fair amount of work, especially into the problem sets which took a lot of time.","Excellent! Reasonable and you will get something out of it.","Parzen is entertaining and approachable. He explains the material very clearly.","This class has a modest to light workload, but make sure to not save the project until the end.","Going through the practice tests is very helpful for the preparation of the exams. In general, it is a really easy class.","The class isn't particularly difficult but you need to focus and do the work or you will be very behind.","It's not at easy as everyone says, unless you took AP Stat. Study and do your p-sets, and you'll be fine.","This is a very good introduction to statistics! You should be able to understand almost all of the materials without any difficulty, so take this course when you have an overloaded semester. If you have taken AP Statistics, I do not recommend your taking this course because it would repeat a lot of what you have learned and you could spend your time learning Stat 110, which I heard is excellent.","I absolutely loved this class. Professor Parzen generates great enthusiasm for the class and it is not too difficult. Psets are time consuming but good to make sure you are keeping up to date with what is going on in the class. There are so many resources for homework help\/exam prep. I am SO glad I took this class. One of my favorites at Harvard so far!","This is a fun, easy class. You don't have to even go to understand the material. Look at the slides and do the homework. I'd still recommend going to class, though, because Parzen is hilarious.","This class is straight forward, and Professor Parzen is a good teacher and is very nice. You should definitely buy all the course books.","Even though this class is easy, don't underestimate it.","A very interesting and practical class but one that is getting more challenging each semester.","The class provides an introduction to statistics with a minimal workload, open-note tests, optional sections, and an entertaining lecturer.","This class is super easy and super useful! You'll find that what you learn overlaps with any other science\/social science class you'll ever take. TAKE THIS CLASS!","I liked how i knew it will apply to everyday life in the near future.","Wonderful class and fantastic professor.","Harder than people tell you it is going to be, but still worth taking!","I enjoyed this class - Parzen is an entertaining lecturer and the exams are straightforward and aren't meant to trick students. This class introduced me to a lot of useful information in a way that involved little work. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in statistics or simply interested in how we quantify and understand things.","Get started on the problem sets early.","This class is fantastic! Well organized, dedicated teaching staff, homework that actually helps and teaches, exams that are actually fair. For such a big class the statistics department really knows what they're doing in giving every student the best experience of intro stat.","This class moves very slowly, so it isn't a big deal if you fall behind. Parzen is funny, but psets can be very tedious. Good as a 5th class.","This class is not easy like everyone says it is. It's a lot of work and the tests are actually really difficult. Don't take this as an easy class.","Take this class!  It's painless if you put in the time and effort.  Everything is straightforward--unlike most Harvard courses, you won't see anything on the problem sets or exams that you haven't seen in lecture or section.  That being said, go to lecture AND section!  It will make a huge difference in your understanding and performance.","It is not \"easy\" like so many people claim. If you enter with this mentality, you will find yourself struggling to catch up later in the course.","An easier route with less math would be stats 100, but this is doable. I would say that for midterm\/finals, take the exams...dont emphasize homework.","If you take this class seriously and really try to understand what is being taught (instead of blindly applying formulas that you memorize), it isn't really an \"easy\" course - in a sense, its as challenging as you want it to be.","This is a great, low-stress opportunity to learn basic principles of statistics. The content very closely parallels the AP Statistics curriculum","The material and problem set is very manageable and useful. Make sure you study for the exams though, purchasing old exams is always a great idea","This class covers a lot of statistical concepts and I felt that I learned a lot and had the bonus of being entertained by Parzen in class which helped me pay better attention.","Be sure to do your pset thoroughly and practice problems before exams!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["frat 104 no more","It was definitely not one of my stressful classes this semester. I breezed through most of the problem sets. With this set, don't completely blow it off because there are concepts that are rather difficult to understand.","Lectures are both informative and entertaining, as Professor Parzen is knowledgable and good at explaining the concepts in a way that's easy to understand.","Parzen is the man. Pay attention in lecture, re-read the powerpoint slides after the lecture, and prepare in advance for exams through practice. This is a very easygoing and manageable course, but do not mess up your learning through poor time management.","A useful introduction to stat","The class was harder than I anticipated and the project was as hard as a final.","Go to all the lectures, as they are very helpful.","Great way to fill the statistics requiremenet. Friendly staff and reasonable assignments.","The Q guide from previous years is not representative of the current class. This new class is much harder. It is a different course.","Come to lecture, listen, ask questions if you have them. Don't worry too much about section, just do your homework, and study for exams. It's very straightforward. Not necessarily easy material, but the structure of the class is simple. You don't even need your textbook.","for pre-meds looking for a stat class: you're better off taking a chance with the life sci stat. this class is currently in an unstable state due to recent changes in structure, so it might not be the easy grade you expected.","They have a lot to figure out in terms of the new format. The material is relatively easy but Parzen skims over it really fast. Also, the midterms were a LOT harder than the exam prep materials and took lot of people by surprise. Some questions were really out of left field and unfair.","This class teaches you very important material. I'm very happy I learned to use Stata how to run regressions. This class is generally pretty simple if you've taken AP Statistics beforehand. Most of the material is the same, so you can pretty much go over the lectures and get the hang of it.","Relaxed class; the problem sets aren't bad. Choose a strong section to attend, and you'll be well prepared for assessments and psets.","Definitely an enjoyable course as Parsen is really funny and makes lectures entertaining, but it is definitely not as easy as it once used to be.","Longer psets, a second midterm, and clicker questions are annoying, but the class is still easy.","Go to section!!!","I took this class with very little Ec background and found myself lost in the business terms that are never explained. I still have little idea what a stock portfolio is, even though I know now how to make predictions about it. Also, if you're looking for an easy gen ed, do not raise your hopes up. This class is getting harder and harder with every term. But Parzen is a rock star and makes the process as painless as possible.","While I had no anticipation of enjoying a statistics course, this course ended up falling short of my expectations. I do not think the material was taught in a way that allowed students to effectively absorb the most important material. I would not tell future students to avoid this class, but they should seriously consider the other stat courses Harvard offers.","This is a great way to learn statistics with interesting applications! Don't be scared off by the economics portion if you are a science-person.","Stat 104 lives up to its reputation as being a super chill class; however, this semester was definitely much harder than previous semesters. Clickers were now required, the midterms were slightly harder, and the psets had WAY more problems. However, still highly recommended.","It's not as easy as you think.","go to section","Harder than its former reputation but a good class nonetheless, especially for a concentration requirement.","the exams are terrible, MATH TESTS SHOULD NEVER BE MULTIPLE CHOICE BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T GET PARTIAL CREDIT.  THEY ARE NOT GOOD INDICATORS OF YOUR GRADE!","It's useful, interesting material that is very manageable! Good way to balance your schedule!","Stat104 is a great intro to statistics.","watch lecture videos use the cs50 app to double speed and you can bang them out in half an hour","This course was significantly more difficult this year than what others made it out to be in the past.  However, Parzen is still an awesome human\/lecturer, and it is great to have even basic statistical knowledge for any field you enter, so definitely consider taking it.","Stat 104 has gotten harder compared to previous semesters, but it is still a very manageable class.  The material is very practical and Parzen is a fantastic lecturer.  I would definitely take this course.","The class is actually very enjoyable because of Parzen's lectures.  He's really engaging and good at relating material to real problems.  Very manageable workload and useful for lots of other classes.","I decided to take this course after interning at a biotech company over the summer and realizing how important a basic knowledge of statistics is in the pharmaceutical industry. I absolutely loved this course. Parzen is hilarious and light-hearted, which makes lectures pleasurable to attend\/watch. Problem sets are slightly more difficult than anything else in the course, but are objectively not all that difficult. You always know what's expected of you. There are so many practice problems made available to you for the exam preparation. This course was great and I really feel like I've come out of it with a working knowledge of statistics and a new set of skills.","Take this.  Everyone should know the fundamentals of statistics to at least the extent taught in this class.  Also, Parzen is a fantastic and fun lecturer, so enjoy the opportunity while you have it.","Parzen is the shit and the class is as fun as stats can be. Take it!","Great intro stat class for any prospective ec concentrator.","This class is not as easy as it was in the past. There is a good amount of work involved. On the bright side, Michael Parzen is the best. Seriously, if I ever have a daughter, I would want her to marry a man like Parzen. A strong man with a sense of humor who signs his emails with simply 1 letter \"M.\" Anyway, the class is ok.","This class is important regardless of what career field one plans to enter","Stat 104 is a great course. You come out learning how to analyze and interpret data, which is very useful for life in general. Also, you acquire stata skills, which are very practical in some careers.","Very good intro to stat.","This class requires hard work and can be challenging at times.  There is so much help available and you should take advantage of it.  Although I did not understand everything along the way, the pieces  that we had been learning throughout the course came together in the end.","Harder than previous years. Not quite a gem anymore.","This is harder than you expect. Get started on your homework earlier in the week. Go to lecture! I think its easier than trying to re-watch lecture videos and teaching yourself. Also take advantage of office hours with the TFs and especially Professor Parzen. They are all incredibly willing to help and approachable. I never went to the sessions they had to do homework each week but that might have been useful. So basically take advantage of the resources they provide you....and not just the week of the final.","learning how to use stata was helpful.","This class is notorious for being easy, but it was also sort of painful if you weren't at least somewhat interested in the material. It was a really good introduction to statistics for econ majors, although I thought it was also useful for me as a premed","Stat 104 is an intro stat class that gives you skills that can be used after college and that still manages to be interesting.","Parzen is awesome.","This is painless.  The flexible section schedule and the minimal psets really help.","My favorite class this semester...and I am a science major.  It was a refreshing course where things made sense, Prof Parzen is hysterical, the problem sets are straight-foward, and you actually learn a lot.  If you haven't take STAT and want a nice class to add to your schedule, it is a definite.  It still requires work and understanding though.","Parzen is hilarious! Also, you get as much out of this course as you put in. At first, this may seem like a blowoff course, but if you keep putting off the work, it will bite you on the butt.","Definitely got more difficult, don't take it as a joke","If you like economics and have never taken statistics, this is a great class. That said, it is easy to anonymously watch lectures from your dorm room and get through p-sets by randomly plugging in commands, so the class is what you put into it. Try to get to know Parzen too--very few people seem to, but he is a great guy.","Entertaining lectures and a wonderful support staff to help you out when you need it. You may feel like you aren't learning much as the class is going on, but you will definitely realize by the end how much you have learned and how valuable that knowledge is (things like p-values, confidence intervals, and chi square come up all the time in life).","If you need to take Stat, take this one.  It is fairly easy material but Parzen is great and really kept me focused on the lectures.  Also his slides have everything you need to know.  There are no tricks or things like that.","Ok class, and a good introduction to basic stat. Does not suck. Lectures can actually be kind of fun sometimes. Sometimes the p-sets are too long and not too useful.","If you have any interest at all in statistics or any fields related to it, you need to take this class. It can also be an easy way to fulfill the Empirical Reasoning gen ed. The problem sets are for the most part painless and you'll find that you actually have a little fun messing with the data on your computer. Definitely a class every kid at Harvard should take at some point in their career.","Stat 104 got a bit harder this year than in previous years, but really, not that much. Just expect to spend a good 5 or so hours on the problem sets, as opposed to the one or two it used to in past years. If you're comfortable with math, you'll totally be fine. Parzen is an awesome instructor, and there's a great support network for helping understand the material. I took this class as an elective, since stats are useful in any field and never took AP Stat. I considered 110, and other 100 series stats courses, but ended up taking 104 since I wanted to learn pure stats and not that much probability (which is what you'll get out of 110). I talked to Parzen during reading week and he helped me make my choice. I'm glad I chose 104. Great course.","Good grade-booster. Teaches good material and Parzen is hilarious.","That they should go to section as often as they can.","Take this class if you are interested in Statistics and need like a basic intro. It's not very tough, and is a great class.","It will get better than our year since we were the first year he made things seriously harder. Difficulty aside, the fundamentals of statistics are absolutely necessary in modern life, so take this course.","Be aware that they made it harder this year. It wasn't hard, some of it was more annoying than hard and a lot of it still wasn't too difficult. There were things on the psets I could not have gotten myself, but going into office hours or study networks got me to understand everything. The teaching staff was really helpful and it was a manageable class overall.","Easy course. I would recommend Stat 110 if you are comfortable with math and want something that's not plug and chug. The exams were seriously based on whether or not you wrote the right things in your cheat sheets.","Used to be a lot easier in the past.  Exams are tricky and the p-sets are long.  If you put the work in it's easy to do well but not a gem.","Go to lecture but more importantly go to section.","The psets are really manageable. Lecture is fun too. Professor Parzen is a great teacher and entertainer so you can't complain too much. I don't really see a reason to take other equivalents (pre-meds - Stat 101?) over this. Take it for Professor Parzen and the great network of friend-support you'll have since so many people take this.","Great for Stat!","Stat 104 isn't super easy, but it can be aced with a little bit of hard work, and it's worth it to get the skill set,","Parzen is extremely humorous and makes the class interesting.","If you don't like your TF go to another one's section; thank me later.\r\n\r\nAlso Parzen rocks","A relatively painless way to satisfy your concentration's statistics requirement, and pretty enjoyable too if you sit back and look for the interesting concepts.","This class provides a very solid basic understanding of statistical analysis.  In a world where we are now accumulating more and more data, it is critical to have methods to be able to properly analyze it.  It is a fairly straightforward class, although be warned that it is not as easy as it had been in previous years.","I thought the class was disorganized and confusing. Most pool say this class is a joke class but I am much more apprehensive to say that. It was hard for me and despite doing well on all the problem sets I found the exams to be difficult.","Pay attention in lectures.","PARZEN IS THE MAN!!! Nuff said.","Take it! You need to know this stuff for the real world, and Parzen does an amazing job of presenting the information in a way that learning it would be a relatively painless process for you.","A lot harder than previous years but still not hard.","Go to section! It may be optional but I wish I had gone. Also, the class may seem easy but the tests can catch you by surprise so make sure to study!","Lots of psets but do-able and resources are available to help.","Very easy if you took AP Stat!","Awesome Course","Class is fun! But a little boring.","do NOT trust the q guide for this course prior to this semester. this class used to be open book for exams, 1 midterm, easy psets, a group final project. not so anymore, it changed quite a bit this semester. you now get a study sheet for exams, there are 2 midterms (which were not easy), the project is done in 1\/2 people, and psets can take you up to 10 hours if you do not know what you are doing... its not super hard but there are definitely easier geneds out there. i would take it but do not write it off as a class you can do minimal work for and still get away with an A","This class's material has not gotten harder, but rather the way you are assessed has. This is still an easy class in terms of how much time you need to invest, but do not necessarily bank on an easy A.","Stay on top of lectures don't fall behind.","This is simply an intro statistics class. For those with no experience whatsoever, and who aren't math geniuses, don't be shy or think you have to take 100. I would recommend 104 because they're not much different, and you might as well. This class is not as easy as everyone says though. Weekly Problem Sets can be long, tedious, and tricky. Tests are graded on the curve, so it is easy to goof up and not get a high score. But, all in all, I would recommend the class.","This class has definitely gotten more difficult. It is not hard, but it does take some time. Do not take it as a fifth course or with three other very difficult courses. Be prepared to actually learn.","Take this course! It's relatively easy and the knowledge is valuable for many other math-based classes.","This class is a great introduction to statistics. It challenges one just enough to engage one's mind but not enough to stop one from doing well if one puts in the effort. Parzen's teaching is quite good and very funny. The TFs are all responsive and helpful. The problem sets are interesting and not too time-consuming. It's simply a very well-constructed class all around.","Parzen is a great prof, and the class has really good support if you are struggling with the material. Lectures are online and sections are optional, but do not fall behind otherwise it might make a very manageable course a hassle.","The course is unnecessarily difficult - should be more straightforward but Parzen's lectures are superfluous and the exams are not indicative of our work.","If you haven't taken statistics before, this is a great introduction. If you have some experience with statistics and are looking for more of a challenge, maybe think about doing 110.","I would only recommend if you need to take for course credit. It will only really teach you how to use STATA and it is not a blow-off class. It requires a lot of work and concentration.","It's really good for someone who wants to understand stats but has very little background in the subject. It wasn't too hard, and was a good introduction to a lot of important concepts. Prof. Parzen is a good lecturer and I liked the laid-back, jokey atmosphere of the classes.","Parzen is an amazing Professor!!! He makes lectures worthwhile! He is always available.","Don't underestimate this course. It gets an easy reputation but Parzen has received some flak for making the course too easy and the new version isn't quite the cake walk it used to be.","This class is just a chore. It is not a bad class and you learn many useful skills, but it is not fun or exciting.","THIS CLASS IS NOT EASY; DON'T BE FOOLED! Despite this, the class does appear to be easy, but not because the content is easy but rather because there are so many practice exams and questions ( Parzen literally prepares study guides for exams and provides them for us; we're talking hundreds of questions for practice. If you take time to do ALL the questions,  by the time you sit the exam\/midterm, you've done so much practice that you can do the questions with your eyes closed. If you take this class, take it seriously otherwise you will actually fail it. I can't tell you how many of my friends were under the impression that they could just walk into the Stat 104 midterms without studying really super hard for it; let's just say things were not as they thought. Go to office hours, get to know Parzen ( he is so awesome and so funny! ). I LOVED THIS CLASS AND IF I COULD TAKE IT AGAIN, I DEFINITELY WOULD. I am definitely taking another class taught by Parzen.","This course is awesome. The professor is very funny and interesting. Lectures are always fun. Also the professor always repeats what he teaches multiple times in the lecture and even after so it's actually quite hard to forget concepts from class. Also, there's a lot of outside class help for the course. Its amazing","Unless you are concentrating in econ, and don't have much of a choice, take a different stats course.","This class is really hard and not interesting at all.","Make sure not to sip behind in the beginning because material piles on very quickly and you will fall behind. The structure of the class makes it difficult to catch up.","A basic knowledge of statistics is beneficial for anyone, regardless of concentration. Stat 104 provides a very thorough treatment of fundamental statistical concepts, ad gives you the background to assess the validity of data and statistics you hear about in every day life. Parzen is a fantastically engaging lecturer, and is great at keeping the class enthused and interested in the curriculum. The class is also very manageable in terms of course load and exams.","Stat 104 is a solid introductory course and Parzen keeps it interesting.","Take this class if you want to learn statistics in a relatively lowkey class.","Understanding problem sets is crucial.","it's not the same gem it once was, but if you put in a moderate amount of time and effort it won't be too bad","A lot of people told me this was would be a super easy class that you can just cruise through. However, apparently, they made it harder this year, and it will most likely stay this way for the future years. Therefore, I would say, beware because this is not the easiest class. The problem sets can be tedious and annoying, and the exams are okay to hard in terms of difficulty. Parzen will say the exams are like past ones and that the level of difficulty is similar to the study guide, but they're not. Regardless, overall, this was a decent course and is not overwhelmingly difficult.","Lecture: engaging and goes by fast each time, make sure to take your own notes, it'll help to make your cheat sheets later, and follow along on your computer on the lecture slides or print them out\r\nSectIon: moderately helpful if you have a good TF\r\nHomework: takes a good while, but not unreasonable, do it a bit at a time as you learn the material throughout the week\r\nExams: not hard, but there is hardly any curve so it is rather difficult to do well (A) on them, sometimes it's a crapshoot and a matter of luck no matter how hard you prepare\r\nProject: surprisingly difficult, but fair, good recap of regression, and he gives you explicit directions and there are plenty of resources to help you\r\n\r\nOverall: really great class for an introduction to statistics, but be prepared to work for an A","It's become a lot harder than it was in the past.","Great intro course and interesting!","Yes, this class got much harder. Which is fine and all, but for me it proved a constant burden. As a humanities student, I went into this class knowing full well that I would need to study 2x as hard as most others to achieve the same grade. However, I was very disappointed that despite how much I studied for each exam and thought that I knew the material, there would inevitably be questions catered to math-focused students, thus making a \"better\" curve. LISTEN humanities people- just don't take this class. Parzen is wonderful and supportive and \"gets\" students more than your typical professor, but this new, unwarranted difficulty will and should discourage humanities students from taking this class. If you do want some statistics under your belt, take one of the other introductory stat classes. You will get more individualized attention and most likely get a better grade. \r\n\r\nSo yeah, I thought I learned a good deal, but my GPA will undoubtedly suffer. Harvard students, we all know the importance of the GPA, so heed my warning friends!","I took this as a third \"science\" class, thinking it would be easier than it was.","It's an easy course that's relatively painless and effortless. Prof. Parzen keeps lectures entertaining, but sometimes to the point that you become unsure of how what you're learning matters in a real-world sense. Also, assignments can seem like a lot of number-crunching without feeling like you're doing problems applicable to the real world, and without feeling like you really understand why they're important conceptually.","Make use of the sections and study networks. Go to class!","This is a very simple and straightforward course. It will be that fourth class that you keep in your back pocket and do fine in as long as you actually go to lecture (go to lecture!!) and do the homework. Exams are very fair. I know it's supposed to have been made \"harder\" this year and yes, maybe it is a little harder than last year, but it's still a great class that you should take for any requirement you nee to do (great for pre med!).","This class will provide you with many useful and marketable skills, particularly knowledge of Stata. It is a very straight forward class that honestly will not require much thinking or work, but if you want to learn the basics of data analysis I would take this.","Parzen is awesome! Lectures are super interesting and material is pretty relevant. The class is not a joke though, I actually put a decent amount of work into it.","It was a god course. Parzen made it fun.","This is great course if you want to get an easy credit. However, if you are looking for a challenging, more thought-provoking course, you should definitely choose Stat 110 or another statistics course.","It's certainly not the most fun course, but Parzen tries to make it funny and it really doesn't require much math for a math based course.  Dull, but super useful applications, and pretty easy.","GO TO SECTION.","This class is actually a blast.  I personally found the material to be very interesting (having never taken any STAT before), and the course did a great job presenting that material in an engaging fashion.  Its not as easy as everyone claims, but definitely doable.","This is a great class. Prof. Parzen makes this the best intro stats class, and the material is interesting throughout the course.","Parzen is awesome. Stat is usually pretty dry, but he makes you want to actually go to lecture. You will get as much (or as little) out of this class as you want.","Easy B but be prepared to be challenged.","It is nothing like AP stats.","I took this course because a statistics course is required for social studies.  I had heard good things about Stat 104 (that you learn a lot and that it isn't too difficult).  Overall the course wasn't terribly difficult but you definitely need to put in more time than I anticipated.  This can be hard because I found most of the problem sets to be really long, so it's difficult to want to go and seek extra help after you've already spent a really long time on those.  I would say that you should take this course if you've taken a high school stats course, and take it if you haven't but you're willing to put in some extra effort\/time.  Don't expect an easy grade.","The difficulty of the class is very strange.","Supposedly harder than previous offerings, but (don't be fooled) the class is still far from hard. Exams are fairly straightforward minus the few questions that Parzen throws in to create some sort of distribution. Psets can be long, but that's life, right? TO PREMEDS: take this course or hold off on 102 until it receives Q scores. Stat 104 is essentially a review if you've taken AP Stats; however, you will discuss regression more in depth and learn Stata. Stata is a useful program for manipulating large data sets. Take the class.","It is a good class but it is a little harder than previous years. Assignments are fair but can be hard sometimes.","Great class, definitely take it","This class takes very little effort.  All lecturers are recorded and sections are optional, so you never need to show up to anything.  Lecturer are boring, though.","This is a breath of fresh air from the rigorousness of other math\/science classes","The class is overall the best way to fulfill the stat requirement that many concentrations have. The class is quite different from years past, but I actually think that is a good thing. Being forced to work a tad harder and actually go to (most) lectures has made me actually learn something--much more than a lot of friends that took it in years past can say. Parzen is also quite entertaining.","Stat 104 is more difficult than it used to be, and will definitely require several hours of work per week on PSETs and many more on the project\/learning the material for the exams. Parzen is a lot of fun (lecture is never boring), section is optional, and overall this is a solid math class for those who prefer the humanities!","It is very challenging and a tutor would be helpful","This class is a great intro to statistics if you have no prior experience and a really good way to fulfill your EMR credit or get a requirement out of the way for social sciences. Examples are interesting and applicable, and Parzen is very clear and approachable. The class is easy enough to be do-able for people with no prior stats knowledge, but contrary to what some think you still need to put in time to study for midterms and the final.","This course is much harder than it used to be. Compared to past semesters, the course now involves: more calculus, clickers (you have to attend lecture), two midterms instead of one, fewer cheat-sheets during exams, and a more strictly-structured final project. BUT, if you take this class seriously, you'll learn a lot and enjoy it.","fun","Difficult but fills concentration requirements for several concentrations.","The more you put in the better grade you get, Section is extremely helpful but annoying to go to.\r\nOverall this class isnt too difficult, you dont always have to go to lecture but it helps you learn material better if you do.","A good way to get the math requirement out of the way, but not a class to be excited about.","Keep up with the lectures.  Don't fall behind early just because you've heard it's an easy class.  It's only easy if you do put in some work.","Parzen is a good teacher and very interesting and fun.","This class had a lot of changes this semester. It was no longer open book and they added a midterm. I've taken stats before so I thought this would be an easy A. I don't know what the grading distribution for the final course grade will be like but I was not very happy with the midterms. They certainly weren't easy. There was a lot of information and it's easy to get tripped up. I'd recommend going to some sections, especially for weeks that you didn't really understand the material. Parzen is super cool, hilarious, and friendly. He really wants you to do well and will give you a lot of hints and stuff along the way as to what will and will not be on the tests","Fun, interesting class!","Putting in the time to go to section is absolutely worth it unless this stuff comes absolutely naturally to you. It will simplify the pset a lot and help solidify concepts before test time and save a lot of time in the long run","The course is not super hard. Go to section, but lecture was not always that helpful.","I have a decent amount of background in math and problem-solving, so I didn't find this class to be time-consuming or difficult at all, despite the fact that it's supposedly harder this year. The psets really didn't take more than 2-3 hours a week for me, and Professor Parzen is pretty entertaining. If you're looking for a nice, easy class that'll still teach you some basic stats while balancing out a harder class load, definitely think about taking this class!","Not only is this course pretty straightforward, but you also learn a lot! I now know tons of useful skills like how to use stata and excel and how to perform hypothesis tests. Parzens also makes lectures fun and entertaining. If you keep up with homeworks and do practice tests before exams, you can do really well in this class and learn quite a bit!","This is a great class to take, especially as a freshman.  Parzen is a great lecturer because he likes to keep it fun with random quirky things. Utilize office hours if you don't understand a concept as it most likely will appear on a midterm. There is a lot of material to know but it is pretty easy one you get the concepts.","This class is a great introduction to statistics. Section is very helpful and although homework took a good amount of time, it was helpful for studying and retaining concepts.","Stay on top of the lecture notes.","Take this class. You will learn practical applications of Stata, and Parzen is a really good, down to earth, instructor.","good course, not too hard, helpful for future","Very good class that isn't too difficult.","Stat 104, in attempting to \"be more difficult,\" just rushes through more information rather than giving students a good understanding of the material covered. Take it if you have to, Parzen can be funny, but knew that you probably won't feel that you love the class. I felt as though I was \"skimming\" the material the whole time, and I even went to every lecture and most sections. I learned enough statistics tools, but do not really understand the theory behind them at all.","The class is great in that you learn a lot but don't have to put in too much work...lots of bang for your buck. As long as you do the psets and study for the test, the material is fairly easy to understand","Stat 104 has definitely gotten more difficult and more math-y, but it's still a manageable course. While the problem sets are often tedious, when I step back and look at the class, I did learn a decent amount and many of the concepts are pretty interesting.","Good class, try and take it seriously although it's not that hard because it's easy enough to get behind the 8-ball because you never went to lecture or section. Homework isn't that bad, and I know at least my section leader was great.","If in doubt, take it. The course was overhauled for Fall 2013, so it's not the easy A it was purported to be in past semesters. However, 104 is fair across the board; problem-sets, while oftentimes tedious, are manageable and can be done in one go. Tests are not easy. Definitely require intimate knowledge of the material and factor significantly into final grades. Take this class seriously and you'll be golden. Parzen is the best.","gotta take it. needs work but not too much","Parzen made the class quite enjoyable, even on days when I was bogged down with other work. If you've already taken AP Stats, this class might not be worth your time, but it could be a nice class to balance your schedule out with. I thought it was a really chill class, even though it was supposedly \"harder\" this year.","Stat 104 is a great intro to stats course. Parzen is funny, keeps it real in lectures (tells you what's important to know and throws shade on people on Twitter), and his lecture slides are great. Homework was longer than previous years but was definitely necessary in understanding concepts. The midterms and final exam were fair.","Problem sets are pretty hard and will take time, but the material is very useful and everyone should have some Stats background.","Very difficult and buy a text book.","Not the most intellectually stimulating class as it is introductory, but didn't help that the material could be explained in 1\/3 the time spent or less. The class seems to be getting more difficult\/has more explanations for the material which can be good or bad thing depending on your reasons for taking the class. Parzen did make his lectures entertain though, even if it did seem like he went on tangents a fair bit","This is a pretty solid, comprehensive intro stat course. Though I can't say I'm actually comfortable with STATA, it exposed me to the software and taught me basic methods of statistics. Workload is doable, psets are pretty easy: just sometimes can be annoying to check your STATA output and numbers since they're still time consuming. Also, tests are doable with the cheat sheet. Parzen is hilarious and has a great sense of humor, but don't be expect to be learning stat for the majority of the time as Parzen mostly just talks about random things. He is super knowledgable and makes stat fun, though","Should definitely have some background in Statistics. Many students have used Stata, taken Econometrics or AP Stat in High School. Your grade will suffer if you do not have any statistics background. This is an intro to Stat course for Stat or Ec concentrators, not a Humanities student\r\n\r\nThe lectures cover complex topics far too quickly and you will need to sit down with the lecture videos adn slides if you want to learn what was just covered.","Take it, watch out for clickers","The course got a lot harder than in years past. Be prepared to do more work.","The course is easy and necessary.  Great to add to a heavy course load.","This course is becoming harder over time. Neither treating it as a joke nor allowing friends to tell you it is a joke class about which you should not be concerned are good strategies\/mentalities to have.","It's not that great of a class unless you need it for a concentration.","This class definitely isn't as easy as it used to be.","You may see from previous reviews that this class is an easy \"5th class,\" but that is no longer true. This course ended up being harder than expected -- it's actually significantly more work than I anticipated. The pests are longer, there are more exams, plus a participation component and an individual project. If you've already taken AP stat in high school, I'd recommend at least shopping the other Stat courses (i.e. 107) -- you may find you get more out of that. If you've never taken a stat class before, it might be good to start with something (like 100) that teaches basic concepts more thoroughly, since this class tends to skip over some of the simple stuff. I'm glad we come away with some knowledge of Stata.","Not necessary, but if you want to take it, you should! Parzen is funny and actually teaches the material really well. Because it's filmed, you don't have to go to class though, so it can be tempting to skip class. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but try not to fall behind on lecture videos, especially at the end when you learn multiple regression. Not fun cramming 5 videos.","This class is so disorganized, but if you desperately want to learn Statistics, it gives you a basic understanding of the subject matter.","It's a fair class that can be frustrating sometimes with psets and tests, but you genuinely feel that the professor and the TFs really want to help you understand the material.","This course is made great by Parzen.  Without him and his humor and stories, the course would be far too dry.  The final project is great, as it forces you to think about why learning statistics is actually cool and worthwhile.  Exams have good curves, but were sort of challenging.","Parzen is hilarious, and the statistics you learn are really important to know. I'm pre-med and I noticed that I FINALLY understood what \"r\" and \"p-value\" meant in all the papers I read for lab. Yes, it's economics oriented, but still really useful for anyone. And it's not too heavy at all on the economics!","Great interdisciplinary class","It got harder. Be careful.","This class is a necessary evil for learning stats, though the final project was a bit contrived this year.","good class but p-sets require a fair amount of time","Make sure you try to go to office hours.","This class has gotten harder than previous versions of it (from what I've heard from peers) but I think it is still a great class to take. Statistics is becoming more and more important in today's world and I think this is a great intro class to that field.","This course was definitely revamped from past years. It is definitely not something that you can just blow off anymore. However, if you really invest the time in learning the material and in doing the work, you can do well.","A light workload pset class that isn't very difficult.","Great, easy intro to stats. Course was revamped this year, but all that means is you have to study and pay attention a bit more. Not a very time consuming class and not intimidating for those who aren't as comfortable with math, ec, and other courses in the quantitative realm. Parzen is also quite the jokester.","Basic intro stat course. If you go to section\/office hours, you'll be fine. Getting the A- is easy, but to get the A you have to be on top of all the little details\/equations to use for certain situations that you'll only know if you go to lecture or section.","Good intro to statistics but found it difficult","Great class to learn statistics in a fun environment. Parzen is an amazing teacher.","Fun, funny, pretty easy","This class was fun, and the material is really useful in a lot of fields.","It's pretty much assumed that you've seen the material before, so the difficulty is going to depend on that (seen=easy, not seen=moderate). The concepts are pretty basic and the problem sets, although longer and more time consuming than previous years, are straightforward. If you run into problems the TFs are happy to help. Midterms had some trickier problems and were more stressful because they were only an hour. The final, however, was a breeze. The project is basically an extended homework and not too difficult. Sections were pretty useless. You only needed to go to lecture if you wanted a clicker grade, but the slides are so thorough that you can do the psets from them alone. Overall this is a solid and non-stressful beginning stat course.","its an introductory statistics class - harder, apparently, than last year, but Parzen works hard to help his students do the best they can. I appreciated him and the teaching staff. if you go to lecture, pay attention, and spend a  bit of time studying, it will be a breeze.","Great class and you learn a lot. It has gotten harder, apparently, but I would recommend it because you learn some really cool things about statistics.","This class is a great introduction to statistics.  Professor Parzen is probably the most accessible professor I have had (currently a sophomore).  He is so easy to talk to and gives great advice on projects, problem sets, and even during exams.","It's a useful class but requires a LOT of input.","You have to take Stats at some point.","Take it seriously, so much real world application!","Take it if you need to for a requirement. It's not that painful. But don't take it for any other reason. Also, don't go to lecture if you don't want to. Reading the notes online is a great substitute.","This class is great for learning introductory statistics.","Stat 104 is gonna teach you very useful tools. The course has more work to do now, but the material is not hard and by doubling the size of the pset it is still not going to increase its difficulty.","awesome\/funny professor, really wants to help students learn and really approachable","the idea that this course is super easy is now dispelled. it is interesting, with good material and fair exams. if you study you can still ace it. however, psets take forever so time must be spent on this course.","Parzen is great in lecture. And, if you have to take a math class for a Gen Ed, this is the one to do since there is no math actually done.","No longer an easy class! Be prepared to spend time working on the problem sets (find yourself a partner) and studying for the exams.","Go to section because that is where you learn and become familiar with the material","If you like to understand why you do the things you do, don't take this class: you are not expected to know calculus for it, so all the formulas are mainly \"memorize and move on\" because explaining them would mean using calculus. If you are taking this class as a simple way to meet a concentration requirement, take it: Parzen is great and makes lectures fun and more interesting than they would otherwise be.","This is a great and well-organized GenEd.  Professor Parzen is hilarious, and engaging.  The course gives you a great background in statistics, and provides a great way for humanities\/social science majors to analyze empirical data.","If you have to take any statistics courses at all, take this one! Professor Parzen truly cares about his students (even though he appears not to) and funny to listen to through lecture. Like any other course, Stat 104 has its flaws and one should consider that it's definitely not as easy as it used to be, but still worth it to take it!","Parzen is so great. The homework is tough at some points but very manageable. Tests are VERY straightforward; they don't try to trick you. Overall awesome class. Sad it's over","Pay close attention during lecture and take good notes. Tackle problem sets in study groups.","Exams are tricky."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Take it with your friends","You will do well in this class if you put the time in. Do not be fooled by the first few lectures which are deceptively easy, because it gets increasingly harder and if you don't put the work in you won't do well.","This class is a great introduction to Statistics! Parzen is funny and does a great job making lectures interesting.","This course gives a fairly good introduction to statistics in the business and finance world. Sometimes topics were not covered in detail in lecture. The TFs are very helpful and want you to succeed. You will be much better prepared for this course if you have taken a statistics before.","Easy course (though that may change with Parzen leaving)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgood, relaxing introduction to statistics.","This is a really easy and painless way to fulfill the stat requirement. It is not as easy as it has been in years past, but Parzen recognizes that so many people have to take this class as a requirement, and he makes it completely manageable for everyone.","It does take a significant chunk of my day one day each week. Problem sets can usually be done in 3-5 hours. It's not as easy as it once was, but it's still a good class. You don't have to go to lecture. Exams are very fair.","This is a very easy class that will give you a decent foundation for understanding statistics, particularly with regard to economics and finance.","This is a class that requires low commitment, but you can get the tools you need to do a good amount of statistics if you put in a little bit of time.","Statistics is necessary in many fields and career paths and this course does a good job introducing statistic concepts.","Professor Parzen is really funny, but oftentimes says things in class that are inappropriate\/uncomfortable. Don't take this class if you think you're going to get an easy A, you have to put some work into it. I also would not recommend taking it to fulfill your math gen ed. This is why I took it, and although I didn't find the course horribly difficult, I did have to spend much more time on the problem sets than I wanted to (even with attending all lectures and taking detailed notes).","This class is known to be one of the easiest statistics course offered at Harvard, but material has gotten more challenging as the years have passed. Don't take it as a joke--work hard, know your material, and you'll come out of the class with a much better, basic understanding of major statistics concepts.","It's an interesting course and the material allows you to think critically about statistics in the world. The assignments are good because they help you review the material and section is also really helpful.","Parzen's really entertaining, but he doesn't teach that much... It's a good way to become familiar stat, but you'll really need to take the onus of learning the material is on you.","This course will fulfill your Empirical and Mathematical in a painless way.  No one goes to lecture or section, but it gives you a good background in statistics that helps so much in economics and other related readings.  Parzen's lectures are so random though that it is much more time efficient to skip lecture and watch them on double speed on your own.","Great elective, easy introducion to stastics","I would suggest stat 107 instead of this course because it was more math based on teaches you R.  In the class description it tells you you will learn Stata.  You don't learn stata, you learn a few commands for doing extremely basic statistical analysis.","Parzen is hilarious and makes statistics enjoyable to learn about.","It's very helpful to meet with Professor Parzen during his office hours for help preparing for the exams.","You shouldn't take this class if you're looking for something involved and interesting. That being said, take this class if you're looking for a low-commitment last class to balance out the rest of your schedule. You don't need to go to class or section and problem sets are relatively easy. Take advantage of office hours.","Stat 104 is a fair class and will teach you many applicable computer skills.","It's an easy intro class in Statistics, but the material is fundamental to many higher level Stat classes. A class to take if you don't have any background in Stat and feel like Stat110 is too hard at the time.","Sections are optional, but it's better to go to those than to lecture. Lectures are entertaining, however, and if you struggle with the concepts you should go.","Very easy class but don't expect to learn a lot even if you have never taken statistics before. Lectures are entertaining poorly organized and unfocused.","Its hard but you can get through the class. I recommend it.","This is a great intro stat class. For those who pride themselves in math abilities this probably is not the class for you. It is not one of the harder classes I have taken in my time at Harvard so far.","It is a very good introduction course to statistics and I really enjoyed the professor.","The class was fairly easy and Parzen wanted everyone to do well. He is funny which makes the lectures more interesting. Tests were easy and everyone did well, so making silly errors really cost you. Not very time-consuming.","Very bland course.","Take it!","It was very manageable if you go to lectures and do your homework.","Really easy class. Don't need to go to lecture, everything is online.","I would say that this is an interesting class that provides you with important life skills.","Very manageable if you do look at the slides\/go to the lectures for areas you've never done before","Stat 104 teaches you useful skills to know. It's the right balance between manageable and challenging.","Problem sets are also long and annoying, and often not too relevant to what you have to know for tests, but overall the class isn't hard!","The class is very manageable, and there's a lot of support available.","Not a particularly hard class, but very necessary for economics and psychology","Chances are, if you're looking at this review, you are going to take Stat 104 no matter what the reviews are like. But it's not as bad as people may say--Parzen is actually a good lecture, and the concepts are useful.","Spend a lot of time trying to break down the concepts and trying to understand what each equation does. You won't get that during lecture (although I recommend attending\/watching) but you should know what you're doing at all times. My TF was amazing and replied really quickly to my e-mails and clarified things, which helped a lot. Do a lot of practice tests because a lot of the questions stay the same.","If you haven't taken statistics before and\/or plan to use Stata for economics, this is a worthwhile course to take. It's pretty easy (especially if you're just moderately competent at math), and not much work.","Take stat 104 as an introductory course to stat if you are at all interested in the area. I took it as a 5th class, and it did not require too much time out, maybe an hour or two weekly.","Stat 104 is really interesting and can easily be taken by someone without experience in the field.  This course is straightforward and not heavy on the math.","It's a relatively easy course that has interesting, useful course. Nothing is impossible to learn in here but everything will definitely be applicable. Also Parzen in great.","Super straightforward intro to stat. Go to\/watch the lectures, keep up on psets, and you'll be more than fine.","Learn it yourself from a textbook in a fraction of the time. There are much better things to do at Harvard.","Follow the lectures and you can't go wrong. Very straightforward class","Statistics 104 was a great introductory course. Professor Parzen is a wonderful lecturer. The PSETS are challenging at times, but not very time consuming or strenuous. The exams are fair, and the fact that the lectures are posted online is a huge plus.","This class, although hard to keep up with, was very informative and useful.","It's a very reasonable and well-organized course.","Be proactive with the problem sets and go to lecture!","They really don't pay attention to you. You're kind of alone in this big course...","Stat 104 is a good intro stat course, Professor is hilarious I will definitely be taking his other courses, you will get out of the course what you put in, exams are fair","This class teaches statistics in a clear and interesting manner.","Statistics is about learning to take qualitative information and interpreting it quantitatively. More and more disciplines are doing this, and it is important that one has a basic understanding of its principles no matter what field one is going into.","As one speaker said during orientation week, knowing statistics is part of what it is to be literate in the 21st century. This course gives you a thorough yet straightforward introduction to the field of statistics. And Parzen makes the class come alive, making it fun, quirky, and laid back. psets are a little longer than they need to be, but still not excessively time-consuming. Definitely take this class at some point at Harvard -- make a reasonable effort and you're in the A range without a problem, all while learning valuable quantitative skills and laughing at Parzen's jokes.","Great gateway class into statistics. Very manageable material, and you will come away with some serious knowledge, if you haven't taken stats before.","This class is great for people who are interested in getting a more applicable learning experience. Although you don't do much beyond hypothetical situations, I think it's a helpful class for people who haven't had prior Stat experience. That being said, there are going to be a lot of people who have had prior experience so they end up screwing the curve.","It's not as easy as everybody says.","This class is poorly organized.","Parzen is hilarious. I actually looked forward to going to this class. I think this class has a reputation for being easier than it actually is. It can be challenging at times, but there are very sizable curves on tests. You really need to take stat no matter what you're planning on going into, and this is a pretty painless way to do it.  I've heard that Stat is the most popular concentration, and I can't help but think that it is thanks to Parzen.","This course shouldn't be taken lightly. The class has a reputation for being easy, but be prepared to put a decent amount of work into the class for its weekly psets, 2 midterms, project, and the final. With that being said, you do learn quite a bit about Statistics if you've never taken AP Stat in high school and the material is useful for the future. Prof. Parzen teaches the material in a funny, light-hearted, but concise and comprehensible way. Take advantage of sections and the help of your TFs!","I initially took Stat 104 because I had heard it to be an easy course.  It is, but I don't think it's quite as trivial as it is made out to be.  Basically, if you have never had stat before, you should treat it as a real course, however, there is nothing conceptually difficult, and if there is, well, there's an army of TFs and resources to help you!\r\n\r\nI thought Parzen was great and Sofia (my TF) was pretty awesome too. I never went to section since it's not necessary, but whenever specific questions arose, both were really responsive and helpful.\r\n\r\nThe stat that you learn is all really useful and everyone really should know it pretty cold, so you should take it! Lots of resources, not conceptually difficult, not time-consuming, and useful.","This class is not as easy at people bill it to be. Also Parzen spends half of lectures talking about three-legged dogs and bashing on the extension school, so good luck paying attention.","I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in statistics or needing to fulfill a requirement for a concentration. This class achieved the perfect balance between being approachable but also challenging. It is not a lot of work, but the work felt relevant and useful to me throughout the course. This course provided me with a strong foundation of statistics for moving forward.","Take this course.","Take this course for a great intro to Stat. Parzen is a great lecturer both in person and from the comfort of your laptop!","Parzen is a great teacher, and makes the class as fun as possible. The work is never too strenuous, but at the end of the semester you will look back and realize how much you learned.","It's super easy if Parzen teaches it. Take it before he leaves.","It's not a difficult class if you put in the time and effort. You'll get a good foundation in statistics.","Statistics is a very cool math. I like it way better than calculus because you can see how data analysis and error can come up in real life. However, there was no intimacy in this class at all. I did not feel like I really got to know Parzen, which is sad because he is a pretty funny guy. Also, he wastes a little too much time in class. I wish he gave us more chances to work problems together","Good course - you can definitely learn a lot if you apply yourself. Don't get behind in lectures or rely on video - Parzen is a great lecturer!","If you are a young social studies concentrator as I was, take Stat 100 in the fall instead. There are too many ec examples which I found very unsatisfying.","The course is great! You learn a lot of valuable skills (Excel, Stata, and statistics in general) in a very low-stress way. It is not too time consuming at all, and you never have to attend lecture or section (just watch it on 2x speed online). Definitely take it! You'll probably need it for almost every concentration, and everyone should just take a Statistics class in general. It's extremely useful and extremely easy.","Parzen is a good professor. He actually teaches the material in lecture which is huge. His dry sense of humor is also helpful to get through the bland subject matter that is statistics. This class is a relatively painless way to prepare for something like econometrics. Wouldn't take this class just as a gen ed though, there are easier math classes (ie stat 100). Use this to prepare for something harder","Stat 104 tends to have a reputation as being really easy. Maybe math is simply not my forte, but I found it pretty difficult and frequently felt lost as I worked on problem sets. Having a good TF, as I did, really helps, but I know of people who did not feel that their TFs were good, and they had a really rough time of the class. Don't underestimate the difficulty of this course, but if you're not a math person, maybe it is still the better math course to take for your Gen Ed.","This is a good overview of statistics if you have never taken any statistics before.","If you want to know stats quickly and without much hassle, take this course. It will empower you quite a bit.","Great class, Parzen is a great instructor, very funny.","Do the psets and go to section. Do a lot of the practice exams and you'll be set for the course.","Stat 104 is no longer the gem it once was. The final exam is forgiving, but the midterms require you go to class and pay attention. However, if you do that, it's great! Section leaders can make the difference though so just find someone good and go to theirs, even if you weren't assigned to their class.","The material is not difficult, but the course requires a lot of work. Dr. Parzen and the TFs do a great job in explaining concepts clearly.","The course is not as easy as the legend tells. The homework is quite long and annoying, and the exams are tricky.","I think that it's a pretty good class overall.  Obviously the material can be dry at times, but it's very useful for just about any field.  Plus, Parzen makes lectures relatively entertaining, and the teaching staff for the course are pretty cool people - you're taught by mostly undergraduates, meaning they are much more accessible than typical graduate TFs (as in the math departments).","This class is great! Parzen is one of the greatest teachers I've had here at Harvard. Unfortunately, he probably won't be teaching next year, but don't let it deter you. The whole staff is great and will be eager to help you learn the material. And overall, the class is relatively easy. If you have any interest in Statistics, go for it!","I really depends on the student. If the student's aim is economics, finance, or any other quantitative field, then yes I would recommend because there's really no getting around it. For social science students like myself, who are mainly concerned with learning the basics of statistics in order to more effectively evaluate quantitative social science scholarship, but don't necessarily have an idea of the amount of work involved, I would say that the course is very fast-paced, intense, and you might want to consider a stats course that focuses on the social sciences specifically.","Get a good TF, and ALWAYS go to section. There's no need for you to go to lecture (particularly as everything is recorded anyway). It's sometimes tedious, sometimes obtuse, sometimes vague, sometimes too theory heavy - but the workload is not overly heavy, and stats is a class you're going to have to take in general. It could be worse.","Great background to stat for those who haven't taken AP Stat in high school.  Very manageable workload, despite the class having been made 'harder'.  Furthermore, Parzen is a fun and engaging lecturer- I went to nearly every lecture despite them being available online because I enjoyed them.","If you haven't taken AP Stat, this is definitely a worthwhile course. It's organized, Parzen is good, and the TFs are overall strong. But if you have taken AP Stat, much of this will be review and it may be a waste of time.","Statistics 104 is a great introductory course. Take it no matter what you're concentrating in--data science is so useful. However, don't be fooled by the \"easy\" aspect of this course. Yes, it is one of the more straightforward courses and yes it is very easy to succeed, but don't let this lull you into a false sense of security. Do your homework, be diligent about learning the material, study, and you will do very well.","It's a good introduction into statistics that doesn't require too much work to do fairly well in.","Sort of easy if you know stat","This class is a pretty easy, straightforward introduction to statistics and working in Stata. You can take it as a fifth class and not actually attend any lectures and still do well without too much effort (prerequisites\/background knowledge is irrelevant).","Go to lecture","It's a good, straightforward class. You get out whatever you put in. That's really all there is to it.","This is a very straightforward, easy class. Parzen and the teaching staff make it very convenient and easy for the students: the lectures are given twice a day and videotaped, sections are optional and all sections are open to all students, lots of office hours and helpful practice material, etc. Parzen really wants his students to succeed. The exams are very straightforward, and this class in general was pretty painless. Sometimes the material was even kind of fun.","Great class taught by a great professor. Definitely the most applicable class to the real world I have taken","It's really fun. Make sure you keep up though. It is incredibly easy to fall behind \/ slack off and it really takes a lot of self control to keep up and to watch \/ go to every lecture. It's fairly easy if you keep up and put in the appropriate amount of effort. Section can be very useful depending on your TF.","This is a fantastic class. As someone who knew nothing about statistics previously, it's like a door into a new world has been opened and Michael Parzen was the doorkeeper.","An easy way to gain tangible data analytic skills. Also Parzen is hilarious; I love him!","This is a wonderful class and truly a lot of fun. If you took AP Stat and did extremely well, I would not recommend that you take this class. Although the class is a lot of fun, there is a lot of overlap with the AP course, so if you really want a challenging class that will build on your knowledge of AP Stats, I would suggest taking a higher level. That being said, this was a great class. Parzen is amazing, and section was always a lot of fun.","If you're looking for an enjoyable, easier addition to your schedule, Stat 104 is the perfect class.  Parzen is hilarious and makes lecture (which, just like section, is NOT mandatory) great. There are some things that aren't explained very well or left for later classes, but so be it. Having taken AP Stat (albeit 5 years ago), I found this class very easy, but it counts for a huge amount of things, which is nice.  Knowledge of statistics is important and this is an un-painful way to get that knowledge.  I did not take this as a fifth class, but doing so would probably be very doable.","Just study and you'll be fine","If you have no statistics background at all, it can be challenging. Despite this however, I actually enjoyed the class.","Midterms were not as \"easy\" as made to seem and you are not given enough time. However, the course material and p-sets were fine. Also, some measures seem to be taken just to make the course more difficult but just be aware and plan your time accordingly and you should be fine.","Stat 104 is an easy class but covers a lot of material. I took stat 104 on a whim, and it was great decision. After this class I am now considering concentrating in stat.","The class is basically designed for you to ignore it and put it off until the last minute.  Try to avoid doing that, because the class does require effort.","This class is really easy and the professor is hilarious.","It's really well-taught and helpful as an intro to Stat.","Parzen is great. The material is easy. You don't have to go to class. What's not to love?","Great introduction to statistics regardless of concentration","Stat seems like such a useful and applicable thing to know, which makes it incredibly perplexing why Parzen is able to teach it so apathetically and in such a boring manner. As great as stat is, if you can avoid this class, do that...","It's a straightforward stat intro class that has a great lecturer and helpful resources in case you need help."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["You know the drill. Easy class, but tedious problem sets. The second midterm this year was unexpectedly hard lol, but the curve MORE than made up for it.","Parzen is an awesome professor but the class is relatively difficult.","Do your work; go or watch EVERY lecture! It' imperative. Do the practice tests and you should be fine. It's a straightforward course.","Go to office hours\/study networks if you need help","it doesn't take much time. watch the lectures online in 2X speed and take notes. find a good section leader. those things make the difference- actually paying attention to the lecture and having a good TF","Pay attention, put the necessary work in, and you'll have a blast","The professor is awesome and engaging, and I definitely felt like the work level was manageable.","Know the material very well. Over-prepare","Very good intro stat course.","If you think you'd like statistics, try it out. Simple enough.","Great introduction to Stata! Do the homework, review the textbook, & you'll get a good grade.","It's a very good course","You'll learn useful skills to use with Stata statistical software. The class will be especially practical for you if you're interested in doing finance work.","attend class","know your regression","I thought this class was really interesting, especially the parts about probability. It helped me think about everyday things differently.","Professor Parzen is great. He's on the student's side when it comes to teaching us and preparing us for tests. He's clear about what he wants us to know, and he purposefully avoids \"tricking\" us. For example, he lets us bring in cheatsheets for the tests, and he says things like, I just want to know what you know. He is student-oriented in other ways, too - he's funny, well-organized, and the notes are clearly formatted to be as clear as possible. Everything in lecture was directly relevant to homework, tests, and career opportunities, and he even included real-world, fun applications of statistics.","great course! easy and delightful","n","Must take course for those with no stats background","This class requires you go to class and do your problem sets. If you're diligent up front, the midterms and final will be a breeze. Nothing is too difficult conceptually, just requires you show up and listen.","Great course and very useful","Not too difficult, but also have to learn all material on your own.","If you've taken AP Stats, this class may be repetitive and boring. However, the only interesting part is its application to economics. Psets are sometimes long and tedious but not very difficult.","A good empirical reasoning course and very good introductory course to statistics.","This class is a very doable class that teaches the basics of statistics well. The workload is very manageable and the lecture are pretty funny but at the same time informative. Michael Parzen does a good job of explaining the concepts.","It is definitely a good class to take if you have never taken a statistics class at all but it is harder than most people make it out to be and also if you do have some knowledge of statistics, it may be worth it to just take an upper level statistics class, particularly if an upper stat class is a part of your concentration requirements.","This is a great class to take, whether you need it for your concentration, Gen Ed, or elective. You will learn a great deal from Professor Parzen, who is funny and engaging. In addition, the grading in this course is very fair.","This class was a great way to get a basic grasp of statistics, as well as flex my quantitative muscles a bit. It was exciting to acquire a skill set with which to parse data and interpret numbers. I also enjoyed the pace of the class-the p-sets were long but helpful and the exams were well-timed for the amounts we had learned.","this really ain't your grandpa stat 104","Parzen is great! Super interesting course, workload is very manageable!","I loved this course. As long as you do your problem sets and attend lecture and section, you will be fine. I really enjoyed this course and my performance in the class.","I really enjoyed Mr. Parzen's lectures. They were both hilarious and worth watching as they covered the material well. Even though I missed one or two lectures, I was able to catch up easily. The workload is completely manageable and you just need to be efficient with your time!","This is an easy course for a good introduction to statistics. Parzen is a great lecturer, and keeps everyone engaged. Overall good class, with a relatively light work load.","Work hard","Go to lecture. Parzen is fun to listen to.","It is a pretty easy class. Plus, the skills that you learn are very applicable to the real world where analyzing data is very important. Also, it gives a pretty decent intro into stata which is a program used a lot in the finance industry.","Very clear structure","I would probably recommend this to someone who is looking for a manageable or easy class to fulfill a concentration requirement or gen ed.","very easy","This is a great course if you've taken AP Statistics in high school and you want an easy course to balance out your schedule!!! Most of it was the same as AP stat, except for material after the second midterm, but it was really easy to understand nevertheless. Parzen is a character, he gives hilarious lectures, but still manages to be on-point with giving the information you need, along with lots of cool extra social\/consumer\/business facts\/information. In addition, the class is very accommodating! Sections are optional and pretty unnecessary, as they just reiterate simple concepts from lecture. You don't even need to go to your assigned TF, you can go to any section or none at all. There's no textbook, all lecture slides and videos are available online, tons of previous exams for practice, and Parzen even has skype sessions if you have questions. It's a great class. Only, the end-of-year project was a bit of a time suck and kind of hard. So set some time away for that!","Go see Professor Parzen! He's really cool and can help you a lot! Don't be intimidated!","It is pretty easy and straight forward. Parzen is funny and his lectures really make sense. Great to full the EMR gen ed or to get a stats requirement out of the way for a concentration. Not a huge workload and the problem sets are so straight forward that they are almost fun.","It's pretty painless","This course really teaches you things you can actually use in life. Everyone should have some statistical knowledge, so if you haven\u00c2\u00b4t done any course in statistics already, you should take it. Parzen is a great professor and I really recommend to go to his lecture. He is really funny and it is easy to listen to him. The problem sets are not that difficult but they are not very short and take some time. I really enjoyed this class!","If you're an economics concentrator or otherwise want to go into finance or consulting, take this class. It will teach you exactly what you need to know about statistics for those fields and pretty much no other fields. Parzen's lectures are a blast, but they don't really help you understand the material. Working on p-sets was the most annoying thing. Each had 15+ questions, with a lot of the questions being basically clones of each other. For the first time in college, I felt like I was doing busy work.","Prepare yourself for the second exam. Overall, a manageable and practical course.","Pretty chill course. I have never taken a stats course before, so everything was new to me. I thought Parzen was funny but he seemed to rush through the lectures. Until I found out that if I just read the slides and watched the lectures online (being able to pause and understand the concepts before he rushes on) I was able to get around full points for all my psets. Make sure you find out how you do well in the class early on in the semester.","This is a well-organized, efficient course.","Parzen's one of the nicest, funniest professors I've had. His lectures are entertaining, which is especially appreciated given the admittedly often dry material. While the material isn't difficult to understand, you can't underestimate it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot taking the homeworks and midterms (really the only two parts of the class you are obliged to focus on) seriously will come back to bite you, and badly.","Really hard, especially for students with no statistics background. The tests were significantly harder than the practice exams (past tests). Section is super helpful.","Do not leave the problem sets until the last minute. Try to do at least three problems a day.","It is a very easy class - Parzen really hands you any information you need to know in 10 different formats.","Stat 104 is so useful and Parzen is a great professor. Enzo's sections are fantastic.","Psets are quite challenging.","You cover a lot of statistical methods in a fast time but it's very manageable. It's not too difficult a class; the psets are long but very straightforward, and the midterms aren't awful. It's a good way to get your math requirement out of the way while learning relevant information.","Its an enjoyable class and it gives you a sound introduction to statistics.","It is a demanding course but very rewarding.","Go to section.","I loved this class, you should definitely take it if you have any interest at all in statistics. I chose this over the other statistics class, and would choose it again just for Parzen's funny lectures and great sense of humor. He is also very helpful and accessible outside the classroom--even on Skype the night before exams!","If statistics does not come naturally to you, get ready to put in a lot of work. Parzen presents the course as easy, and for some students it is. However, problem sets can takes 6-8 hours if you want a good grade on them, and the midterms were not easy. Final was pretty easy.","I highly recommend this course. It is not the easy, do nothing course that it once was. But with a little bit of effort I believe that everyone can do well and learn a lot.","This course is an easy way to satisfy EMR and the stats requirements for Gov and Social Studies, especially if you have taken AP Statistics. If you're really into statistics, take a higher-level course. Parzen gives informative lectures (although some would say otherwise) and he always makes himself accessible to homework and test questions.","Parzen is so worth it! He's really funny and he is great at explaining the concepts. Everyone is really accessible so there is always someone there when you need help. All of the lectures are video recorded making everything really convenient. Overall, I learned so much from this class and I really enjoyed it!","This is a fair class. If you need it for a Stat requirement, I would take it. Going to section is incredibly helpful for the pset.","good class, moderate work load, helpful skills","I would probably recommend this course because I learned a lot and the professor gave interesting lectures.","If you need help, go to section and office hours!","This class is not the most exciting one you'll take, but is useful if you need to know stat.","Professor Parzen is the best! Take this course!","Take this class if you can follow lecture slides as another might follow a textbook.","This class is a great introduction to statistics. As long as you watch\/attend the lectures and go to section, the class is very manageable and enjoyable.","For students with no previous statistics background, this course provides a wide-sweeping introduction to statistics in an interesting and comprehensive way. Professor Parzen keeps the material exciting.","Take Stat before. It's super interesting, but incredibly difficult if you don't have a mind that understands Statistics.","Do not treat this as an easy side-class. Put in effort and you will be fine. Go to lectures and buy the course pack, and you will almost definitely get a great grade.","A good class, but don't underestimate it. TAKE THIS CLASS INSTEAD OF ANY BIOLOGY STATISTICS SORT OF CLASS. Parzen is a great professor.","I don't think there is a *great* intro to stats class at Harvard, so this may be your best bet. Parzen is an engaging lecturer and isn't evil in his expectations of you. Still, though, this wasn't an extremely pleasant way to spend my time (as someone with very little interest in stats but a concentration requirement to fulfill). I would recommend watching the lecture videos and reading over the notes at minimum; also, do your psets. I would say it is possible to do very well in this class with a moderate amount of effort, and passably with a very small amount.","Definitely got harder than previous iterations since I've shopped it before. But it's actually a fairly useful course giving a great intro into probability and inference. Don't expect to understand the mathematics behind everything yet, but stat 104 actually give you a pretty solid foundation and birds-eye overview that will help you understand things once you take later stat courses.","Learn the things, low work, funny ish lectures. Watch them at home 1.6x","This class is not too taxing and teaches you some really important and applicable ideas.","It is imperative to do the HW in a timely fashion or you will be scrambling to finish. The material isn't terribly difficult if you go to class and ask questions when you have them.","The professor is the best, actually go to\/listen to lectures. Also if you fall behind on something just talk to someone because they really would rather you do well.","Stay up to date with the psets and watch the lectures on 1.5x speed.","Lectures and section were completely unnecessary. Honestly, I did this entire course by just looking over the lecture slides weekly to tell me how to do the homework. Parzen basically read off the lecture slides with some annotations (that you could find on the lecture recording anyway). And if you were ever unclear, you could just watch that small part of the lecture.","Amazing class. Take it!!!","It's a great introductory course! A little misleading because the class is much easier for those who have taken a statistics class in high school yet it is still doable.","If you're an Econ concentrator you need this or stat 100 and this one is more comprehensive and interesting (so Ive heard). Beyond having to take it as a concentration requirement, I really enjoyed this class and found it really interesting","Great class! Very interesting and very helpful TFs","Great introductory stat course","This is a great intro course into statistics and provides quantitative skills necessary to do good research and to understand economics (or similar social science disciplines).","Very straightforward and well organized class. If you are interested in majoring in statistics, this is a very good introduction and you learn a lot of foundation to hypothesis testing.","The class is fun, Professor Parzen really cares about you, and section's are optional. I'd suggest you take it if you like Stat and Ec.","The course head and TFs definitely give you the necessary resources to be successful in this class, if you put in the work.","Psets are very manageable. Midterms were fair, but the final was definitely a lot harder than I expected. Parzen is hilarious, so I think he is worth actually going to lecture to listen to, but the online recordings are awesome for whenever you miss a class (just stay caught up!). Overall not too stressful of a course and not too much time committment.","You will love lectures because Parzen is hilarious, and it isn't really easy but you finish the semester feeling like you actually learned a lot","While an easy course, it is equally engaging.","Watch the lectures online, but actually watch them. The material is easy to keep up with if you watch the lectures, but its hard to teach yourself if you fall behind on the videos. Also, Parzen is a great lecturer so they aren't impossible to get through.","This class is very straightfoward and as long as you attend lecture (or watch them online) you should be fine. Do not underestimate the time it takes to do the final project though, and make use of the resources available--i.e. the plenty of TFs, Study Networks, and Parzen's Skype office hours.","All lectures are videotaped. This is a good thing because, while Parzen is a good lecturer, he talks slowly and also get distracted. You can watch lectures on 1.5 speed and it is great. Psets are time consuming but doable.","This course is a walk in the park as long as you attend lecture and take good notes. Beware the final regression project, however; it really needs to be done over the course of multiple days.","Very fun class. Not too difficult. You definitely don't have to go to lecture (you can learn everything from the coursepack), but lectures are pretty fun and you probably should go.","There are weekly psets, a regression project, and a final. None of the work is too bad, but buy the lecture notes because they are helpful.","That you really don't need to go to any classes. With the formulas on the cheatsheets that are allowed for each exam, you can just used the formulas.","I learned a lot in this course but it is important to navigate the resources properly (i.e. finding the right section leader for you).","Parzen is pretty funny, but it can be hard to learn the material necessary for psets\/exams from lecture. Sections are super helpful if you find a good TF.","Good class, useful, not too challenging. Definitely go to Parzen's office hours instead of the TFs.","Take this class if you're a sophomore taking orgo and looking to take a dub to balance out that L in orgo","Stay on top of coursework!","I really enjoyed Parzen's lectures, and the material is very straightforward. What's expected of you on assignments and exams is very clear, so it's clear how to do well in this course.","Watch the lectures, do the homework. Memorization is a good skill to have. Parzen is really funny so lecture is not boring even though the material can be really dry.","take it","The class is a good amount of work and is a good introduction to stats for econ majors.  If you do your work in the class, and go to the lectures, you will get an OK grade.","Go to lecture!","Parzen is great, class is great, so many resources. I really ended up liking stat and will continue. I highly recommend it.","Especially for an intro-level course, Stat 104 was tremendously well run. Lectures were interesting and fun, and the fact that they were taped was also an added bonus; sections were well run; and P-sets and Exams were fair and returned amazingly quickly. \n\nThe only reservation I can note is that, if you took AP Stat in high school, upwards of 75% of it is essentially the exact same thing and just review (it goes a little bit more in depth with stuff and covers a lot more regressions, but that's about it for the differences). I took AP Stat before, so this course was quite easy and I unfortunately ended up taking away very little new knowledge from it. This isn't a fault of the course -- it is an intro class, after all -- but it is something to be aware of.\n\nSo, if you didn't take AP Stat, TAKE THIS COURSE. It's fun, it's interesting, it isn't too difficult, and it teaching important information. If you did take AP Stat, it's still a fun class to take, but only do so with the understanding that you probably won't take much away from it.","Surprisingly loved this class. Prof. Parzen is the homie. Yes, I actually went to lecture and enjoyed it. Stat is nice because it has more practical applications than other math classes.","TAKE THIS CLASS. It is one of the few that is completely manageable and teaches you a lot about the subject, professor is amazing, material is easy to understand.","Parzen is a great lecturer! Take this class if you want an engaging introduction to statistics.","DEFINITELY harder than past years. Expect the exams to be harder (at the rate Parzen is going). I don't know how other EMRs are, but you'll need to study a bit for it and put some work in the p sets.","pretty clutch","Good course, Parzen is probably one of the best teachers at harvard. I have some complaints though. First learning is seriously compromised not working in groups on the final project since we dont learn anything then. In a group you learn from everyone in your group, alone you just do what you already know... Second complaint: the homeworks take forever and dont need to be that brutally long.","make use of all the help available to you","This class is nothing to be afraid of.  Parzen is hilarious, the lectures are engaging and, if you for some reason are unable to be at them or fail to pay attention, the lecture slides teach you basically everything you need to know.","Stat 104 provides a pretty solid base in statistics with introductions to many major topics. The material is fun and is constantly being applied to real life scenarios\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere is very little theory. I have never taken a statistics course so it was perfect for me, but if you have, or are looking to really push yourself, 110 might be more fitting. If you are looking to learn stat, work to succeed, and have a good time, there is no better course than stat 104.","Stat 104 has definitely gotten harder over the past few years.  I got a 5 on the AP and I can't really say that it helped me at all.  The psets in the beginning and end were reasonable, but some in the middle were ridiculous.  The midterms were not too difficult, but you were pretty pressed for time.  I'd say only take this class if you need to, otherwise you've just found yourself a bunch of busy work for the semester.","Interesting class, great professor, exams proved to be very difficult.","Low workload, very manageable.","Not as easy as you've heard, especially if you haven't taken stats before.  Parzen is a bro","Good course, solid introduction to statistics. Not the most unique or fascinating course but the knowledge is good to have. Very much routes students into finance or consulting","do the psets and go to section","This is a very great course to get a pre-med requirement done.","A solid class to take, definitely recommend it as a means to understanding statistical analysis.","Stat104 is an easy class on a week to week basis. You don't necessarily have to go to lecture in order to understand all of the material, and though the psets sometimes can take time, they're not too difficult. The only thing is that the tests get a little weird on you. Even though you know the material and you can have note sheets, sometimes there's not enough time to finish them or there are weird questions and the tests are much harder than expected.","It seems like a pretty generic Stat 101 -- other than using Stata and having a few classes about stocks (and, after all, who isn't going to be dealing with stocks in their lifetime?), I think that this course is good for anyone who wants to know Statistics, whether its for an economics degree or not.","TAKE THIS CLASS! This is a very engaging class. The real life applications make lecture interesting each day. \nPROS:\n1. You can watch all lectures online (use 1.5x speed so they go faster)\n2. Section is optional\n3. Cheat sheets on tests\n4. Parzen is a boss\n5. Lenient curve\n6. Essentially the only three times you need to go to class are the 3 test days\n\nCons\n1. First Pset is a pest but they get easier afterwards\n2. The final project is very tedious (but extremely interesting for some)","Stay on top of work!","This class is a good introduction to statistics. Prof. Parzen is very funny and tries to make entertaining lectures. The course is quite easy, but the problem sets are a lot of work and can get annoying.","This is such a great course that I think should be necessary for everyone -- it's an interesting first look for those less technical how information can be misconstrued. It also, on the flipside, shows how powerful statistics can be in estimations and providing guesses of things you never thought you would be able to guess. The class is very well -- and humorously -- taught, and there are SO many resources in this class that it makes classes like CS50 seem like a barren wasteland.","Great into to stat. I was afraid to go into 110 without any clue about what stat was so I'm happy I took it. Not much work and taught by a super funny professor.","It is the only class that I actually enjoyed going to lecture. Professor Parzen is incredible!","Stat 104 is NOT as easy as previous years, the problem sets are not necessarily difficult but are very time consuming, the final project takes some effort, the means for exams are not particularly high, i.e. the class is not a cake walk, you need to put work into it. go to section!","this course is very straightforward and organized. the problems are predictable, and as long as you put in minimal effort (complete the psets, skim over the lecture slides), you will do well.","take if you must--you will be fine","It's an interesting and pretty easy course.","It provides a good foundation for statistics. It is a good course because you gain the following three:\n1. Applicable sets of statistical skills\n2. Knowledge of STATA\n3. The ability to read long questions and power through seemingly long psets.","If you study and do lots of practice problems, it will be easy. Straightforward but requires some work. \n\nWarning - lectures can be a waste of time, since Parzen tends to go off topic a lot.","It's a great course (mainly due to the awesome professor) and is an easy way to substitute for the Math requirement!","Go to section. Give yourself enough time to study; the material really isn't that hard.","This a great introduction to statistics. I have heard that there is a lot of overlap with high school statistics classes (especially AP Stat), but as someone who had never taken a stat class, I found it extremely useful. Professor Parzen is a great lecturer, who is really funny and always keeps things interesting, so you should really go to lecture (even though they are all online). Sections are optional, but I would definitely go, because I found them extremely useful.
