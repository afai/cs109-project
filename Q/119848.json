Tianxi is a great professor, though you have to constantly remind her to SLOW DOWN.","The first half of the course is very mathematical. It looks at linear regression from geometric point of view (projection and such).\r\n\r\nThe second half introduces you to concepts in modern statistics, like multiple hypothesis testing and regularized regressions (LASSO, ridge, ...). These are very important topics in statistical research today, and everyone who cares to practice statistics in the 21st century should take the course.","It's a difficult course but definitely worth it and if you are willing to put in the time, you will be successful.","good to have strong linear algebra skills, expect that Tianxi goes fast, but don't worry if you don't understand 100% during lecture.","Only take this course if you are a)in the Biostatistics PhD department b)a super theoretical math whiz.","This is a very difficult and time consuming class.  Tianxi is great though, I just wished she slow down!!!"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is a great course. The material is really advanced so please be prepared to feel stupid as the instructor teaches! You should certainly review some linear algebra before beginning the course! If not, you will make this course really hard on yourself!","This course is to prepare you to do research.  So, you need to take a lot of initiative yourself to explore some of the materials.  The materials only make sense if you are willing to spend the time to read about it yourself.  Most of the materials are not in any textbooks.","I enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it.  It will serve as good prep for the qual and reviews topics in probability and methods I.  Tianxi and Jen did a great job, although Tianxi moves fast and it is good to not be shy and ask her to questions.","It's cool. You'll have a deeper understanding of regression, and learn about methods for high-dimensional data (second half of the course). Assignments are reasonable.","This is a great course.It provides a nice review of classical linear models and also gives an excellent introduction to the modern regression methodologies like Lasso, SCAD etc. \r\nTianxi is a great instructor.She is very energetic,always open to questions and discussions inside and even outside the class. And last but not the least, the homeworks are not too frequent and\/or burdensome.\r\nSo all the more reasons to take this course !"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["If you would like to understand the theoretical concept behind regression, this class is enlightening.  If you think regression is useless, then you will find yourself frustrated for the entire semester.","This course is a considerable amount of work, but is incredibly useful for an aspiring statistician.","It is essential to review linear algebra before taking this class.","Be prepared to write down what's on the board in class and then look at it later; it's often hard to follow during class.","Lots of work, but Bob Gray's expectations are at least consistent.  The course content is not taught well --- again, we look at trees all day, and never talk about the forest.","Be prepared to work a lot and teach yourself a lot of the material.","Avoid.","be prepared to live in BOBBY'S world"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The lectures are boring. The slides are great. The material is important, interesting and useful."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is an essential course on the theory of linear models and modern regression methods including LASSO, PCA, etc.  It also helps develop familiarity with techniques to solve analytical and computational problems in these areas.","It is very helpful for understanding statistics.","The lectures are very dry and boring, but on the other hand they are very clear and detailed. The slides are very thorough on their own, but so dense it might be hard to read them without attending the lectures. Take this class if you want to understand the full theory of linear regression, and solid amount of machine learning stuff too (lasso, SCAD, cross validation, etc). Don't take it if you only want to know how to apply various predictive models. Make sure you are very strong in linear algebra before the class, and get a copy of Hastie\/Tibshirani... Elements of Statistical Learning for the second half of the class. It is a useful supplement to the lecture slides."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"11","response rate":"54.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BIOSTAT 235","course_id":"413","cat_num":"7549","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BIOSTAT 235","course_id":"413","cat_num":"7549","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BIOSTAT 235","course_id":"413","cat_num":"7549","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
