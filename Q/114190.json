Be prepared to learn and to work."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I love space. I have loved space since I was a kid. This class tells you a lot of interesting things about space, but the class itself is disorganized and there is regular work.","I found it difficult to retain and often merely to understand what I was taught in this course because the opportunities for using its concepts were quite limited. If this course introduces weekly psets or written assignments to reinforce the reading and lecture material, I'm confident it will be the best SPU out there, and I would in that case strongly recommend it: at present, it has all the ingredients of a great course (highly committed and knowledgeable teaching staff, fascinating subject matter, interesting labs), and just needs to be restructured.","One of my favorite courses I have taken so far at Harvard. If you have any basic interest in Astronomy then this is a perfect course for you. It literally goes over every single concept of Astronomy that there is--from how stars form to the Big Bang to telescopes. It also really is not too tedious, as the labs only take 1 hour.","This class is about an amazing and wide-ranging topic, covering \"the world around us\" so to speak. You do get lots of glimpses of fascinating scientific observations and ways things work. Lectures can be difficult to understand, and lab write-ups are many and relatively long for a Gen Ed. There is also little way to practice the nuts-and-bolts concepts before the midterm or final. On the other hand Josh (Grindlay) introduced some helpful example problems around midterm-time. One of the best times is going on the roof with classmates to observe the night sky, for the evening labs, mostly toward the start of the term when the weather is favorable without too many clouds. You record images with the telescope, too.","might be a little too mathematical for some","This is a good Gen Ed in that it is small, the subject matter is interesting, and the assignments are hands on. I liked the direct observation involved in the course and wish there had been more of it. Lectures could be a little hard to follow.","Definitely requires a bit more work then a normal gen ed but I think that is just the case for SPU."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class has the potential to be hands-down the best class at Harvard. A few organizational changes--weekly quizzes, no true or false on exams, and weekly review components of sections--would make it fantastic. It is an extremely large amount of material to learn but it is an amazing introduction to astronomy and at the end you will be surprised by how much you learned. In the end, you can explain how the universe began and how it will end, and how all the stuff that occurred in between came about too. Josh is an amazingly knowledgeable lecturer and is responsive, receptive, and interesting in the well-being of his students. The weekly observation sections are an amazing opportunity and if you dedicate some time to this class and its readings it will be very manageable. If you do not, it will be difficult. This is not an easy SPU, but it is extremely rewarding.","This class is great. Please take it not just for the GenEd requirement (it's probably not the easiest SPU class) but because you're really interested in the material, otherwise it's a waste of really nice and competent teaching staff.","This is a special course at Harvard: it is small, hands on, and intriguing. The teacher staff is great and extremely dedicated. However, the evaluations are not extremely reflective of the course (I think this is changing so that it is). And sometimes that lectures are a little long (since it is a 1 1\/2 hour long class)."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 21","course_id":"2022","cat_num":"4775","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 21","course_id":"2022","cat_num":"4775","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCI-PHYUNV 21","course_id":"2022","cat_num":"4775","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
