'08":{"comments":["Don't expect to get much other work done the semester you take this -- it will dominate your existence.","Intensive second year Russian is exhilarating but overwhelming. I often felt bombarded with more grammar and vocabulary than I could process at a time, but it was an amazing experience to look back at the beginning of the semester from the end of the semester and realize just how much Russian entered my head in just a few months. I have a new dictionary in my mind, and it's a little bit terrifying.","It is extremely rewarding but the course requires a huge amount of work. So schedule carefully when considering the course."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["work hard","definitely the most enjoyable class I took at Harvard (I am a junior). I have even decided to do summer school in St. Petersburg after taking this class","One of the best classes you will take at Harvard.","Don't be intimidated by intensive courses!  -- At least in the Russian department, the teachers are so supportive and the workload is by no means unmanageable."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["It's important to attend class every day.","If you are a \"heritage speaker,\" you should definitely take this course after Slavic Ac. It's a great, well-organized course!","Do not take the class unless you are prepared for a very heavy workload and prepared to do a significant amount of work above and beyond what is even put in the syllabus to get a high grade. A lot of initiative is required to do well because of the lack of good organization in assignments\/ materials and inability of the instructor to quickly and clearly explain a lot of the grammatical concepts. Attendance in class is strictly enforced even though lessons aren't usually very enlightening. You can learn a lot from the course it just tends to be a somewhat grueling experience.","This course is definitely intensive, and is not for anyone who is not willing to put in significant time to studying. I know I sometimes slacked on learning vocabulary, and it catches up with you extremely quick. The professors are wonderful (Vladimir is extremely funny and likable) and you'll learn the material at an alarmingly fast rate, if you put the time into it. It is much more difficult\/work intensive than Slavic Aab.","It's Slavic Bab. It will be hard. It will be rewarding. You won't enjoy all of it, but you will enjoy the outcome.","You will learn tons of Russian, but it will be a long and painful process.","Very intense, difficult. Great, but hard."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you put in the time (and a huge amount of it) you'll learn an incredible amount very quickly, but you need to be willing to prioritize this class over pretty much everything else. The amount of concrete work is already significant, but you also need to be able to put in your own time studying and reviewing","Work every day on your grammar!","If you put into it the time it demands, this class will teach you Russian very quickly. You won't find a better instructor than Natalia Chirkov, or a better TF than Ainsley Morse. The textbook, by Chaput, leaves much to be desired; this, however, is not enough to change the fact that this is an excellent class for anyone wanting to learn Russian quickly."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.20","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RUSS Bab","course_id":"4522","cat_num":"1657","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RUSS Bab","course_id":"4522","cat_num":"1657","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RUSS Bab","course_id":"4522","cat_num":"1657","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
