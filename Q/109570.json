Excellent readings strike the right balance between theory and case studies. Anya is a great teacher and very knowledgeable in the field.","You will learn an interesting perspective from this class - one that, in my experience, is not commonly taught in most Anthropology of Religion courses.  The information presented is both interesting and useful.","This is a challenging course that is well-designed and moderated.","A great class if you're interested in the subject. Will introduce you to a lot of important theorists and also provide many interesting case studies. Not a difficult class to do well in if you have experience in social sciences\/religion, but might be difficult for students just starting out."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 1936","course_id":"10659","cat_num":"79416","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 1936","course_id":"10659","cat_num":"79416","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 1936","course_id":"10659","cat_num":"79416","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
