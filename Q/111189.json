much work you put in.

That said, I had a great experience and am glad I took it.","You will often feel as if you're on your own and you don't really know what Chris will like.","great but A LOT of work","It is a wonderful way of exploring your creativity. It forces you to look at your world differently.","This is an extremely fun class, where the rewards are very high.

You will learn so much!","As long as you get along with Chris this course is awesome, and even if you don't it's still pretty damn good.","If you put the time into it, you will be amazed at how good the pictures you take can become.","The class was amazing but definitely required a lot of work. It is definitely not an \"easy art class.\"","I would only take this class if I was really interested in photography and I would not take it if I had a busy schedule already, as it is very rewarding, but it is also a huge time suck.","A fun class to take if you're really interested in photography, but be prepared to spend a lot of time editing photos...","You learn a lot about photography and how to use it effectively. I always thought good photography would be the typical \"postcard\"-type pictures, but this class taught me otherwise."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Must have a love for photography!Overall an incredible class!! Definitely a Harvard-must.","A VEs studio class is a great way to break out of the Harvard routine and explore your own creativity.  Photo is a great starting point; it's relatively simple to master the equipment and easier to approach than, say, painting or filmmaking.  Chris is a great teacher and personality, a very fun instructor for the morning hours; Kent is a devoted TF who can answer practically every technical question thrown his way.  The small size creates a community, and the student-instructor bond is necessarily a close one.","I would tell students that this course is a great way to use a nice DSLR camera and use photoshop.  It gives a ton of freedom to take pictures what you want, but the judging is subjected to whatever the professor likes.","Wonderful environment and photography is something of a life skill and this class is a great introduction to a powerful and practical art form. Chris and Kent are great and very willing to help. Whether for VES credit or just curiosity, explore and take this class and maybe pick up a great hobby in the end.","I think this is a great class if you have an interest in photography, whether as a possible concentration, or as a side interest. Prof. Killip and Kent are a great team to introduce you to the world of photography, and the class is fun and educational, and very different from your other classes most likely, if you are not very involved with the VES department.  It is a lot of work however, so not just a class to be taken because it is \"easy\".","If you can, I would strongly recommend taking this course - it is different than other courses in that it allows you a lot of freedom and does not deal so much with knowledge as with creativity and fun."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Do not take this class.  Chris Killip makes repeated references to how Harvard Students cannot shoot very good work because we are spoiled and do not live in \"the real America.\"  He does not encourage development of a personal point of view, but aesthetically limits the creative growth of students to fit his own style of shooting.","Do not take the professor and TA's gruff attitude personally."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This is a GREAT class! Chris Killip is definitely an awesome guy, although he may not be everyone's favorite person. You might compare him to eggplant. You either love it or hate it. He certainly knows his stuff, and has been doing this for a long time. This can be seen as a drawback, though, because he has very specific ideas of what is \"good\" work. He insists that we shoot only in color and never in black and white because we \"live in the present.\" He also has a tendency to insist that people take photos of their \"lives at Harvard\" because it is something he is interested in seeing - and it may not be what your interest is. He talks a lot, so you have to be okay with not adding much to the conversation but mainly listening in lecture and looking at lots... LOTS of slides. The photographers that he shows are INCREDIBLE and you learn a lot from simply looking at them. The critiques of your own photographs during class are useful too - although don't be shy to simply speak up because if you don't, Chris may end up running the show. The time spent in lab is GREAT and always productive, and Derin, the TF knows his stuff and is also a ton of fun. Chris and Derin make a great team, and I am always smiling when I leave that class. It's a lot of work - 6 hours of class a week and a TON more photographing and working in the lab, but if you're willing to put time into it you'll take a ton out of it. This class made me decide to concentrate in VES.","if you care about grades, dont take this class cuz you wont know till the end of semester.\r\nit is important whether you like the professor's own artistic style, since it will exert a strong influence on your work.","It is truly fantastic. There is no way you won't enjoy it. Take it if you don't know anything about photography, take it if you know everything about photography, take it if you don't even like photography. Just take it.","Just get out there in the beginning of the course and photograph as much as you can.","I really enjoyed this class. It was such a good community where everyone was improving and learning from each other. Sometimes, in class, the slideshows were really long (sitting in the dark is sleep inducing), but all of the material was really interesting. I definitely learned a lot about photoshop and became a better photographer from this class.","This class is great if you love photography and want to get better. One thing to note that the course evaluation is high subjective. Therefore, if you have strong views about how things should be done, it may be a challenge. If you are willing to submit your interests and allow them to be shaped during the course of the semester, you might find that the final product is quite nice.","Budget a lot of time to get comfortable with the camera and with shooting. Especially early on, team up with classmates and go shooting together so that you can learn from each others styles and interests.","Shop both the 40a courses (with Chris Killip and Sharon Harper) and choose who you feel you jive better with as an instructor. I found Chris did not give detailed enough feedback to learn quickly--while my photography did improve and I got a better sense of what makes a good photograph, Chris's very brief critiques were often unhelpful for learning.","This class is awesome, but Chris can give contradictory advice sometimes and can be very hard to please.  Other times its difficult to tell if he likes or does not like your work which can be awkward.","One of the more useful classes at Harvard."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["If you are lucky enough to get into this class, you will love every minute of it. There's nothing else like it at Harvard, and if you have even a vague interest in photography this class will be very rewarding.","This is a wonderful class!  It's so much fun and you actually learn a lot not just about art and photography, but about perspective and how the way you view the world is incredibly constructed.","The professor and the TF were very relaxed and taking the photographs and coming up with a project were extremely fun."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["A photography class at Harvard has tremendous potential to inspire, educate, and reinforce creativity amongst a sea of classes within the University that do not particularly focus on the artistic realm. However, due to a number of circumstances, this class was tragically a great miss. A large, and justified, concern towards the beginning of the semester surrounded a lack of technical teaching with using the provided Canon DSLR camera. Much to my surprise, students were expected to expose for their photos properly, despite not having sufficiently learned the settings that would enable us to do so. Weekly critiques were typically unhelpful as those students who were visibly the favorites of the professor received extensive feedback, while the vast remainder of the class was presented with generic comments. The quintessential generic comment, \"Just keep going with it,\" was incessantly offered as feedback each week by the professor. This sort of response to student work is counterproductive and left genuinely diligent students with mere rhetoric, as opposed to a set of comments that would have gradually lead to improved work. Many of the students in the class, particularly those who were the apparent favorites, also appeared disinterested during critique, offering little in the way of helpful criticism, and all the while basking in a flood of useful feedback from peers and professor for their projects. Another source of frustration with the class came in the form of bizarre comments made on the part of the professor. Rather than giving encouraging comments to student work, I once witnessed the professor refer to another student's work as \"boring,\" and to another's as, \"not that bad.\" Such feedback might be considered acceptable if followed up by more descriptive clarifications, but as standalone comments, it is discouraging at best. Finally, I find it comical that the professor was shocked that he had to struggle to fill all twenty slots in the course (10 for the AM section and 10 for the PM section) after hosting extremely harsh and critical interviews with his potential students at the start of the semester. It is no surprise that many scurried off.\r\n\r\nThere is just so much more to express, but a lot has already been said. It is hard to be so negative towards a course, but I genuinely feel that any positive points are minuscule in comparison to the grand scheme of things.","Best class I have taken at Harvard so far. Derin and Jeff were amazing, the learning curve is gradual but huge.","You know those long nights spent agonizing over an essay in Lamont? Now imagine that those same long nights are actually fun! That's 40a in a nutshell: a lot of hours photographing, a lot of lab time, but strangely enough you end up enjoying even the time-consuming aspects of it. Very satisfying and fulfilling to create good work.","Great course and a lot of fun! Definitely recommend taking it, but be prepared for it to take a lot of time.","This course is a time commitment--but if you're invested in it, well worth it!","this class is a lot of work, but extremely fulfilling.","This is an amazing class. It really changed how I view the world. I'm not an artist but this class really pushes you beyond your limits to produce work you're truly proud of.","In my four years here, this is THE BEST class I have EVER taken at Harvard. Seriously, I have never done anything more rewarding and more fun than this class, and I'm walking away with so much knowledge and appreciation for photography that I know I will carry with me for the rest of my life!\r\n\r\nInterview for this class, no matter what it takes. You'll be so glad you did.","Beyond being able to impress your friends with the ability to take stunning and captivating photographs, this course enables students to learn a new way of thinking about communication.  Learning how to construct the elements of a photograph or take a great photo on the first try rather than spending hours on photoshop have taught me how to better construct and effectively go about creating arguments in my writing and in my life.","It is a LOT of work. This particular professor had clear favorites, and it was quite annoying. He thought he was good at hiding it, but really wasn't. Worse, it often felt like he didn't know how to teach photography. He didn't help those who needed help, but instead said, \"Keep going at it.\" It was incredibly discouraging. Also, many people of this particular class were terrible people who tried to give me detrimental feedback to ruin my project. The TF was incredibly helpful, however, and I did learn a lot about photography as a whole. I really liked what I learned about photography and hope to maintain it was a hobby. However, it was a lot of work and not always a pleasant class, so do keep that in mind."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["An amazing class with an amazing professor and an amazing TF.","I loved this course. It takes more time than you would expect because you spent a lot of time editing photos in the lab, but it's fun and you have great photos by the end. Chris is amazing (and funny, especially when he gets off topic) and Robert was a lifesaver.","Just take it! I don't understand why people say it's a lot of work. Just take pictures every week, go to office hours before it gets busy. If you take good pictures and just decide on a project, it's not rocket science. And you learn a lot.","Take it! Absolutely amazing experience! Chris is super interesting and very committed, and the TFs are unbelievably helpful and patient. This class provides a nice counterweight to all typical academic classes, and while it might be time-consuming sometimes, it is totally worth it. Not a typical Harvard experience, in a very good way. I've had an unbelievably awesome time the entire term. Highly, highly recommended!","This class takes a lot of time, especially at the beginning, but it is sooooo worth it.  I learned so much, and I hope to take more photography classes after this course.","If you take this class, try to take it with Chris.","Chris has a lot of experience and provides a lot of insight.  The only thing is that he is very sure about what he likes and is not very lenient with what he doesn't like.  Robert is an incredible TF, though, so make him your friend!!!","Amazing course - be prepared to spend a lot of time in photo lab editing your pictures, but you definitely get better at it as the semester progresses.  Chris is extremely knowledgeable and has a very refreshing personality.  The TFs are an amazing resource and they devote so much time to the course!","Highly recommended for students who are willingly to put in the hours for the great rewards during and at the end of the course!","huge time commitment"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Take this class definitely worth it.","Really wonderful course!","So much fun -- the best class to balance an otherwise stressful course load, or during senior spring. Chris is one of the most amazing photographers out there, and a great teacher in his own unique way. He will really train your eye for photographs. I will certainly be continuing photography as a hobby in the future, and it was great to receive some formal training in college. Also, you get to make a book at the end on any topic you choose -- pretty awesome experience, and unique at Harvard. TAKE IT!!!","FOCUS ROBERT! Great class, unbelievable instructor. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this course!","Chris Killip is hands down a fascinating instructor and fabulous mentor.  I learned so much from him not only about photography both directly and indirectly, but a lot about life.  He is truly inspiring and really changed my perspective on a lot of things.  What you learn about photography is important, but what Chris teaches you about life is the true takeaway.","This class is a lot of fun; you end up with awesome pictures and get to learn photoshop. Class time feels like a waste though because you don't get time to edit your photos and what we talk about doesn't really apply to developing our own skills at photography. A lot of it is practice with the camera. That being said, it was a pretty easy class and it was a nice break  from typical Harvard classes (coming from a science concentrator).","This class is absolutely worth it! Mike is a fantastic professor, and you will see yourself improving. Be prepared to spend 10-20 hours a week on the class.","This class takes a lot of time, but it is so much fun. I underestimate how much time I spent shooting photos or thinking about what sorts of photos to shoot. Editing photos, took at least 4-5 hours the night before an assignment in addition to hours in the photo lab earlier in the week. It was definitely stressful at times, especially when making the final project, but the process and the results are rewarding experiences.","Great great great class. Take it.","This class can get very frustrating, but is totally worth it. This is a very non-Harvard-y class, but in a good way. It was a great contrast to the daily grind of psets and papers.","I love Mike and Robert! They're so attentive. Best class I've taken at Harvard.","This class is a great introduction to photography.  Chris is such a knowledgeable teacher, and Robert is a great TF who is always willing to help.  Your photos will definitely improve as the course progresses, but don't expect a lot of detailed feedback from Chris - he wants you to learn more on your own and by doing than by telling you exactly what to do."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["If anything, this class will help you train your eye to spot good pictures from the okay-ish ones. You'll definitely learn how to get the most out of your work in Photoshop as well.","Take this if you want a solid grounding in traditional photography. Amazing class, and it is as time consuming as you make it.","This is an absolutely fantastic course, but you must be discipled. Be prepared to spend hours every week in lab, and make sure to take as many pictures as possible, every single day. As I realized towards the end of the course, this isn't the hand-holding photography basics class. You are expected to take photos, edit them, and analyze their pros and cons. Only after you do that can you move on to the next set of photo-taking and take even better pictures. Practice makes perfect. Not an academic photography class.","Somehow, the three-hour class flies by every Monday and Wednesday. Chris is quite brilliant and funny - an extremely entertaining presence. While his honesty can be sometimes brutal, it is also legitimate and ultimately helpful. Anyone interested in photography should take the course - you get to use a very nice camera, learn the ins and outs of Photoshop, and have full freedom in creating your own project throughout the semester.","Chris is very interesting to learn from. If your interested in photography, this class will give you a new perspective on your own work, bolster your skills (particularly in editing and publishing), and give you a solid introduction to the work of the field's greats. Be prepared for it to be time-consuming.","Chris and Robert are enough of a reason to take this class even if you don't think you have much interest in photography.  Chris's talks about photo books during class were alway fascinating, and I learned a ton about photoshop in the lab with Chris.  A nice perk about the class is ending a week before reading period.","As long as you have time to put into taking and editing photos, you'll do fine. It's less about graded work and more about producing something super cool in the end.","This class allowed me to tap back into my artistic side which I always neglect in college. Sure, Chris won't learn your name until the last week, but you get to create art. Your homework is to take photos and at the end you get to create a beautiful book. It takes time, but its worth it. If you can get into the class you should absolutely take it. Liberal arts education for the win.","A fantastic, fun class with a brilliant and engage professor. Chris makes the class fly by and is really inspirational.","great class to get your toes wet with photography. however, the emphasis is more on photo-editing (eg. you take a photo in your dorm, and it looks really yellow --> use photoshop to change the tint to make the photo less yellow). that aside, Chris is amazing and Robert is a fantastic TF. Like, actually. Take this class with Chris\/Robert because they are the best!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["My only regret is waiting until senior year to take this!","Great, course, you will learn a lot and have a lot of freedom to explore different aspects of photo that you want to","This class does teach you the basics of photography, as it is supposed to, but instead of cultivating a love for the art, it makes students dread some aspects of photography that are very easy to love.","I thought I wouldn't be putting a lot of time into this class this semester, but I was wrong. Chris Killip really challenges you to improve during the course of this class, and he really pushes the entire class to do so. Classes are very enjoyable especially as at least an hour of each class is dedicated to critiquing each other's work (although mostly it's just listening to Chris comment on your prints). If you want to learn a lot about the physical act of shooting photos, this is not the class. It's more a class where you have the freedom to exercise the creative skills around the photo shooting and post photo correction process. You will use a lot of photoshop and hopefully get proficient at it. But really the most valuable part of the class is the process in which we create our final project books - a cohesive set of prints that we eventually layout into a photo book.\r\n\r\nTake this class if you want to change the way you think, especially if you are a non-ves concentrator.","This class is AMAZING! I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest bit of photography interest. Chris is such a funny guy, with so many stories of his experiences and just a great guy to get to know in general. In terms of workload, don't be daunted by the requirement of 150 photos a week; chances are you'll take way more than that. Also, the VES department is just amazing in terms of equipment and resources. In the beginning of the semester, you get a Canon Rebel T3i DSLR with the kit lens, but they also allow you to borrow other types of lens, such as nice prime ones. The photography lab is also stocked with glossy photo paper and other goodies, and the quality is just amazing in general. Long story short, take this class!","A great option if you are interested in photography! The class is challenging but not off-putting, and you come away with a different way of looking at photography, as well as the ability to color correct effectively.","It was often difficult to figure out what Chris wanted and what he was looking for, but seeing your final book at the end makes it all worth it!","This is hands down the best class I have taken at Harvard in my three years here. I'm a neurobio concentrator, and took it as an elective, but I'm so happy I did!!! It teaches you to think in an entirely different way-in a way, it teaches you how to \"see\", and I now look at the world around me differently. I would certainly say that it changed my life and I would absolutely take it again if I could. Professor Killip is one of the most amazing people I have met in my time at Harvard-not only as an instructor but as a life coach. Each class was full of laughter and in all the classes I have taken at Harvard, this is the one where I felt like I had learned the most in one semester. I definitely plan on taking another VES class, and cannot recommend this class enough!!! If you get in, you absolutely have to take it!!!! It certainly isn't easy, though. In the last few weeks leading up to submission of the final project, I spent 20 weeks or so in the lab .Unfortunately, Robert, the TF (who is also incredibly awesome) won't be here next year, but that definitely shouldn't stop you from taking it!! In summary, it's a wonderful class with a wonderful professor, and if you are self-motivated and enjoy photography, you will undoubtedly love it.","It is one of the gems at Harvard- Chris is a very well-known and respected photographer and critic, and it is definitely an amazing opportunity to have him as a professor.  It is also super fun to come in and hear his stories, and you really get to bond with the class.\r\nIt also exposes you to the amazing VES program and all the carpenter center has to offer. My BIGGEST regret is not taking this class before my senior year and being involved in this department throughout my time at Harvard. Don't wait- it's not that much work, it brings a whole other dimension to your life and how you see things, and gives you a great book at the end that you can have forever. And it is an awesome awesome way to spend your time- it satisfies the inner creative in me as well as an academic look at some of history's greatest photographers.","A lot of fun, but tedious at times."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Really awesome course if photography is a skill that you are at all interested in developing. This will be something that I use throughout the rest of my life, so I found it to be an invaluable course. You will learn photoshop and you will at the end of it have a series of beautiful photos and a book to display them all in.","Killip is truly inspirational and his devotion to photography is evident. This class is more of a documentary style of photography, so if you like broading your knowledge of photography skills beyond simple pretty pictures, this is the course for you.","Choose to work on the final project on the topic that most interests you and inspires you.That way you will have fun working on making a photo book in the end, and your genuine interest will be shown in the quality of the project.","Fantastic course! One you will not regret taking while at Harvard! Chris is amazing, a pleasure to hear him speak.  He is a wise and talented man!","This is a fantastic course to take if you are looking for an introduction to photography. You learn so much about not only the physical act of shooting, but how to edit the photos in Photoshop. You acquire skills that will last a life time. However, this class takes ALOT of time. You should not be going into this class thinking it will be your \"light\" course. It takes a lot of time just to shot the dang photos, and even more time to edit them, and as you are new to this, you will constantly feel like you could be doing more. You will do a disservice to yourself if you do not spend as much time as possible on your photos. You also won't realize how much of a giant Chris is in the field of Photography. Get to know him. He is a good contact to have.","This course is really a hit or a miss, but I probably would not recommend it unless you have a lot of background, extreme interest in photography, a lot of patience, and a lot of free time in your semester. Basically, the class is structured so you really can't do well in it and there is very little constructive feedback on your work. Instead of telling you how to improve, you'll be left with a diminished sense of your work, because if Chris or Nori don't like your work, it'll automatically be deemed bad. I always left this class feeling worse about myself as an artist and feeling inadequate and unhappy about my work. Again, I would not take this as an easy, fun elective. It's just not worth the 5 hours you'll spend perfecting just one picture on Photoshop, only to hear in class that your work is inadequate.","VES 40 is awesome.","Every taken a picture and want to take more? This class will make you better, and you'll have fun along the way. Chris and Nori both rock as people and as photographers, so don't miss the opportunity to take this class.","It's a lot of time. If you have a fairly easy course load and want a fun elective it's a great class. But the class itself is six hours plus any extra time you need to spend in the lab. So make sure you have the time to put into the class.","I didn't learn much and felt like the two three-hour classes we had each week went to waste. You don't develop personal style but rather end up catering to what you think your professor will like.","This course is absolutely amazing. Chris is the most chill, accommodating and personable professor I have ever had, and Nori is amazing at helping you out with every aspect of the class\/project. Could not have asked for a better or more fun class. And you actually learn quite a lot of super useful stuff.","Great for picking up Photoshop skills and learning your way around the camera. The grading is more or less subjective -- you will come into class one day with photos that you think are awesome and get shut down (in the nicest way possible). Just stick with it and keep shooting. You can never have enough images.","TAKE THIS CLASS! It is by far the most rewarding class I have ever taken at Harvard. The classroom dynamic is very unstructured and relaxed, and both Chris and Nori give really insightful and helpful feedback. Also, they both bring humor and interesting stories to the class discussion. You will gain useful Photoshop skills and have access to all the free materials and software you could possibly want. This class is very time-consuming, but so, so worthwhile and rewarding. I highly recommend this class.","Great course! Killip is really cool."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"6.10","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"20","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 40a","course_id":"5153","cat_num":"2010","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"4","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 40a","course_id":"5153","cat_num":"2010","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 40a","course_id":"5153","cat_num":"2010","1s":"0","2s":"9","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
