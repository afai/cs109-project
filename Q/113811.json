'08":{"comments":["The material is fun, but the final was monstrous. Be prepared.","Stat 110 is slightly inconsequential or at least not so worthy compared to this one.","If you don't understand the material after staring at a tersely worded textbook for a while, it's unlikely you will ever understand it.  This class has few resources for struggling students; be careful.","This course is surely going to be different next year, as Paul Bamberg will not be teaching it. So anything I can say is going to be irrelevant.","If you want to go into economics or biology, stat 110 might be better. This gives you a much better theoretical background though, and you won't be a formula-pusher later on. Bamberg is a wonderful professor. b","Those with significant mathematical background may be bored by this class. Those with no formal experience in proofs may feel slightly overwhelmed by the need to replicate them on tests, but this can probably be studied for fairly naturally.","It is not taught at too quick a pace, but offers exposure to lots of material.","Easy and enjoyable.","This class covers both, the theoretical and the computational aspects of probability theory. Many interesting examples and paradoxes are introduced and explained. It also exposes students to proofs.","I highly recommend this course. It was an extremely enjoyable math class with an excellent professor.","Try to read the textbook beyond the regular material to get some more theory out of the course.","It teaches important skills, so it is probably a good idea to take it.","Professor Bamberg is brilliant; unfortunately, part of this is that he uses the word \"obvious\" in a fashion I was not previously used to.","An excellent Freshman Spring class for math people: not too much work, not too advanced, and completely unrelated to freshman intro math classes, so you never feel like you're doing too much math."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This class is a great introduction to probability theory, which is something any intelligent person should know about.","If you want to have an introduction to probability that goes deeper than just being force-fed formulas, but still remains accessible and engaging, take this class. \r\n\r\nIf you're trying to decide between this and Stat 110, in terms of material you cover almost everything in Stat 110 in 154, but also there is more emphasis on proofs and a whole section on random walks.","It's pretty good. I did learn some stuff. The course should be refined to remove the influence of previous instructors, however.","Very very useful.","This class is one of the easier classes in the math department however it is also one of the less interesting classes.  Be aware that the professor will be working off of someone else's notes (unless Paul Bamberg is teaching) and that you will need to put time into the homework, not that it's difficult, but it is time consuming.  I didn't notice it myself but for some the presentation will be much too rooted in proof with not enough application.  If you want application first and foremost don't take this class.","The material is cool. It's more problem based than most math department courses, which was refreshing to me but might be off-putting for some. The material carries the class; the professor adds nothing to it, and the book could be better. But I really like probability--it's fun and useful.","If you took Math 21 or higher, you should definitely take this course instead of Stat 110"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["I liked the material very much and thought it was quite interesting. I think it made me better at mathematical problem-solving. McMullen is a great lecturer, one of the best in math dept -- when I couldn't go to class I felt like I was cheating myself.","Definitely take this class is it's taught by professor McMullen..you'll never have a more structured and fun way to learn probability.","McMullen's such a boss. He's an awesome guy and instructor. Course material is fun. If you oversleep, just read the book and you can still get it. Just can't say there's any flaw.","It's a great course, where you can tell the professor and the tf were invested in having students learn the material. If you don't have as much math background though, it may be quite time-consuming","Probability is awesome. I do think though that what made this class awesome is McMullen. He is the best Professor here by far.","This is a great class if you are interested in the more theoretical side of Probability Theory, or if you want to take something like Stat 110 but with fewer students.","The interesting material as it's now formulated is about enough to cover half a class.","The course covers very interesting material and Professor McMullen is an amazing lecturer. The first half of the course was relatively easy and didn't take much time, but the material in the second half became much more difficult.","The class was great. McMullen is an amazing teacher.","Fantastic class if Mcmullen is teaching.","Prof. McMullen is the reason to take this class.","Probability is an important subject that everyone should be somewhat familiar with."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Though this class seems to be one of the easier math classes, its difficulty depends on the professor. The material is interesting and good things to know, but it can turn into a challenging course. Bourgade is an incredibly smart professor and his lectures are clear, but he often does not realize that we, as students, are significantly dumber and less educated than he.","Hard but fun. A tad too formal at times. If you want more applications, look at a Stat course, but this course is great.","If this class is still taught by Paul Bourgade, check to see whether the syllabus has been updated. Professor Bourgade is kind, professional, personable, and knowledgeable, but his expectations for this course were not reasonable. Granted, this was the second year that 154 has been offered, so there was no precedent for him to follow. But the philosophy of \"bury them in work and compensate by grading leniently\" is something that future students deserve to be warned of.","Good class.  A lot of material presented, you'll learn a lot of math along the way.  A quick pace, unless you're already familiar with a lot of measure theory or real analysis. Very much the \"pure\" side of probability, not a statistics course."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class was veey challenging, but it was equally rewarding.","Some of the most interesting material in all of mathematics, taught by surely one of its greatest exponents. A must for any mathematically-inclined student, not just in mathematics itself, but also in fields from economics (my discipline) to physics to statistics. This course will not only stand you in superb stead for further work on this subject in mathematics, but also give you a significant advantage in any science that makes substantial use of probability - which is to say, all of them! The importance for progress in human knowledge of a rigorous understanding of the fundamentals of probability (which are much more subtle and wondrous than one perhaps at first suspects) cannot be underestimated. Take this course, be amazed, and be glad."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 154","course_id":"2873","cat_num":"4306","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 154","course_id":"2873","cat_num":"4306","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"6","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 154","course_id":"2873","cat_num":"4306","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
