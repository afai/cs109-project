He provides strong feedback on assignments and cares about the progress of students. What was most fascinating about the course material was its expansiveness as we touched not only the political and economic aspects of Korean history and contemporary culture, but also critical issues of social change from the family to religion and gender.","The course is a fantastic overview of Korea from the late 1800s to the present. Professor Chang is a great lecturer, extremely knowledgeable, and very engaged with his students. The course does a great job of providing historical context. However, because of the wide scope of the course, some topics are not covered in much depth. The course doesn't include much theoretical content or cross-national comparisons, so the content is not immediately useful beyond Korea. However, Korea's history and modern experience is so interesting and often unique that I found much of the course to increase my understanding of other countries as well. Overall, the course provides a great overview of a fascinating country.","For anyone who is interested in Korean culture and history, this class is great. The content is very extensive and you end up learning a lot about Korea within just a few weeks. And everything you learn is very interesting and by the end of the course you feel you have a good grasp on Korean culture, history, and its sociological issues. Also, Professor Chang is a big reason why this class is great. He's a great lecturer, genuinely passionate about the content, and a real chill dude. He's very down-to-earth and makes the class really enjoyable. Great class.","This is an awesome course! Professor Chang is a great lecturer and just a really nice guy, very chill. Definitely take this course if you're interested in learning about Korea!\r\n\r\nThe work load is very reasonable as is the mditerm and final.","If you are interested in taking a relatively relaxed class to learn about an overview of South Korean history and modern social change, this is your class. The professor is cool and engaging and very helpful. If you are not a humanities\/social sciences person, don't worry because the professor can help you a lot. But remember that there is a 20-30 page paper at the end of the course.","Read the wonderful resources that Paul has assigned for the class...and then some. It's amazing how many different voices Paul makes sure to incorporate in understanding Korean society.","Even if you don't know much about South Korea, the material learned in this course is fascinating and will help you think about social change on a national scale. The course material provided a solid, historical foundation as well as sociological framework prior to diving into some of the social changes explored in the material such that prior knowledge is not necessary so do not be intimidated. Especially when many of the courses in the Sociology department seem to focus on wider notions of inequality across large, diverse populations, this course is a refreshing take on applying sociological framework to a more narrow focus field. Professor Chang is a lively, passionate lecturer and makes you feel invested in the course material. None of the readings or coursework felt like 'busy work' or unnecessary; every hour you put into this course is for your own benefit and does not feel like wasted time."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I took this class because two of my friends had taken it previously and both said Paul was super chill and a great professor. Definitely glad I took it! They were right, he's a great lecturer that cares about the material and getting students interested in the material. I think he also just relates well with students. The course is well structured and doesn't ask too much from you outside of class, except for the final essay. Even then I ended up writing more than I expected, and I attribute that to Prof. Chang giving useful feedback early on and respect for his class. For my first sociology class, this was great!","This is an excellent course for an overview of Korean history.  This is great if you want a refresher or general information, but it's not the course for you if you want details.","Professor Chang is a great lecturer! If you want an overview of Korean history with a focus on understanding the developments that have contributed to the making of Korea as it is today, it's a great class.","This is a great class, definitely take it if you want to have a good introduction to Korean history.","this is a wonderful class! Professor Chang is an awesome professor and an engaging lecturer. This was the first class I've ever taken on Asian history\/Korea itself, and I was fascinated by what I learned in every single lecture. It's also has a relatively light workload so it's the perfect class to take if you need to balance out your schedule w\/ a class in which you can just listen, learn, and appreciate the material :)","Professor Chang is an amazing professor who truly cares about students learning and delving into the material. He truly made this class an open learning environment and brought much of his experience into it which always makes it relevant and important material. The class itself is very useful and provides historical context to better understand the social changes that have happened. It was a very positive learning experience!","Incredible class - one of the best I've taken at Harvard. Lectures are engaging, the exams and the paper are actually quite fun, and the history\/social changes of South Korea are fascinating themselves. Prof Chang is fantastic teacher who is accessible, knowledgeable and truly cares about his students.","If you have any interest in Korea, this is a great class to take. The normal workload is just readings and the lectures are very engaging.","I cannot recommend this course highly enough. I think it may the best course I've ever taken at Harvard. The workload is more than doable, expectations for assignments are clear, and the lectures and readings are uniformly fascinating.  Professor Chang is very funny and witty, passionate about the subject material, and really cares about his students. If you are debating between taking this or another Korea-related class, TAKE THIS CLASS. You will come out with a great grasp of the changes that modern Korean society has undergone over the past hundred years, and a better idea of where Korea headed. This course reinforced my decision to go into Korean studies after graduation; maybe it will change your life like it changed mine.","The organization of the class could use a little fixing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"4.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"17","response rate":"76.47","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 181","course_id":"11169","cat_num":"28405","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 181","course_id":"11169","cat_num":"28405","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 181","course_id":"11169","cat_num":"28405","1s":"4","2s":"5","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
