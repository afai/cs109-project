If you do put in the time you will certainly learn a lot about planet formation and orbital dynamics. This course covers most of this material in the context of the current questions in the exoplanets field which really helps you ground the topics you are learning in the science questions of the day. I've felt more like a scientist in this class than any other science class.","While this course may be a lot of work, it is extremely rewarding! The problem sets help explore and cement concepts about exoplanets. You get to write your own functional code for orbital elements and near the end of the course you get to run computational simulations of processes discussed in the course. The teaching staff is really involved with the students and they strive to ensure you understand. The presentations from CfA researchers is another great opportunity to learn about recent discoveries in the field. If you have any interest in exoplanets, Astro 189 will prove to be an amazing course.","Good for people who like planets!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.83","difficulty":"3.33","recommendation":"4.83","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ASTRON 189","course_id":"273","cat_num":"92184","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ASTRON 189","course_id":"273","cat_num":"92184","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ASTRON 189","course_id":"273","cat_num":"92184","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
