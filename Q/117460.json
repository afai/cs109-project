And be good at memorization.","Very easy but not much opportunity to learn about acting, beginner-level","It's fabulous. Show up, memorize your lines, and work on following the comments you get.","Memorize your lines and come to class. Easy A."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["if you want to gain a better mastery of verbal and non-verbal presentation and composure, learn how to act, and learn the fundamentals of comedy, you will enjoy this course.","A fun class that will teach you to be a better actor.","Such a fun class!  Take if you can, it's really different from other classes I have taken at Harvard.","Really fun! Something a little different than the average class at harvard.","Will Lebow is a comic genius.  You'll learn a lot from him."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Just be ready to wake up early and be outrageous. Will's a fun teacher to be around and you'll no doubt have fun, but some of the work can be unfunny so you have to make it funny yourself.","Be ready to break out of your shell! Do not hold back in this class - it is all about exaggeration and playing with real intention. Audition - do not be scared. It's so much fun!","This is a great class!  It's a lot of fun to work on the scenes and do acting games with other people.  The class is easy because there is not a lot of workload (a few light readings of plays) but you need to be ready to take risks in class.","It is not so much a comedy class as it is a basic acting class. The instructor is a very good actor, but go into it expecting a basic acting class. Should be called \"Acting\" rather than Comedy.","Definitely sign up if you want to learn more about comedy. Note though, that contrary to what things may seem, this is NOT a class in stand-up - it's formal theater","This is a fun, easy class in some ways that will nonetheless challenge you as an actor and really teach you great things about comedy acting and comedy in general. Mr. Lebow's awesome. Christina is great too.","The course is fun, and does teach some basic pillars of comedic acting-- but I did not feel that I grew in any significant way as a comedic actor.  It was apparent that the instructor did not take much interest in our progress, and was not really prepared to teach something so intangible to a group of such varied experience levels.","This class is really easy. It's an extremely low time commitment and is really fun. However, if you're looking for an intense experience that changes the way you've always approached comedy, look elsewhere. I, honestly, don't think I improved very much from this class."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class is so much fun! It's not too time intensive, except when it's your week to present your scene, but Scott is an amazing teacher. He clearly knows what he's talking about and sees every possible opportunity for a joke that there could be. No opportunity for comedy is left unturned!","You get what out of this class what you put into it.  And it is SO much fun.","Be prepared to take initiative and look for your own material. This can be the hardest part of the course, but it is the most rewarding since it introduces you to so many plays.","Scott Zigler is brilliant and deeply respectful and a great director. Getting to work on a scene with him is wonderful. Especially when you ask for him to put in time outside of class (which you should do!!! it might seem like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that invested, but he just has a lot of students to work with, and so won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t volunteer to go the extra mile unless you ask for it). Also, the more prepared you as a student come in (as per usual), the more you get out of your time working on a scene with him. Be warned, though, students spend most of the time watching other students be directed and frankly, it gets hard to continue to remain attentive after a while, even though the professor is doing excellent work. On top of that, when you do get to work with him, it feels like there is nowhere close to enough time to really play as much as you might like. Also, it was possible to completely check out and not be called out for it. I get that it isn't only the teacher's responsibility to make sure students are paying attention, but i also don't think an hour and 15 minutes of the class should go by without 3\/4 of the class having to have been paying attention.","Great comedy work - definitely more in-depth than I thought it would be.","Ziggler is a genius. You learn, you write, you watch, you laugh - and every single day he amazes you with his insights. It's absurd. As many classes as you can take from him, take. You leave infinitely improved, no mater what your original level of skill. His attention not only to nuances of performance but to facilitating a more sophisticated and practical knowledge of comedy on stage is invaluable for anyone who is interested in pursuing the medium in any capacity.","Great class.  Scott's really smart, and you will become a better all around actor by taking this course","This course is supremely fun! If you're into comedy and have a spare class, it is a must-take. Scott is always available to you, even if you want to talk about a project unrelated to the class such as a play you're doing. The types of comedy covered are broad. Highly recommended. Scott is a fantastic teacher!","It's a fun way to learn about the nuts and bolts of comedy acting, as well as get a taste of comedy writing.","It's super helpful in learning how to mechanically create a comedic scene. It's also pretty laid-back and great when you work on your scene. Great class - awesome if you're interested in comedy, specifically in plays. We also got to write a sketch and get feedback, which was awesome.","This class was very fun and when you were not performing it was very laid back and you got to watch everyone else perform."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"DRAMA 116","course_id":"648","cat_num":"9926","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"DRAMA 116","course_id":"648","cat_num":"9926","1s":"9","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"DRAMA 116","course_id":"648","cat_num":"9926","1s":"4","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
