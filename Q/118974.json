'08":{"comments":["First, there will be a different instructor next year, so it is impossible to be sure about anything else.\r\nSecond, probably, this course will be less time-consuming if you bring experience coding, documenting, finding and remembering details of  statistical software functions --details of syntax and parameters. Certainly it will be less time-consuming if you take it with a team of people who will help each other split the workload.\r\nThis year the course was short on ideas and long on coding, reading computer output, exploring messy datasets, completing writeups for grades, and repetition.\r\nThe exams put a very high premium on speed, high premium on examsmanship. That will change at least a little. No other course and instructor are so extreme as this, as far as I know.","This material is definitely interesting, but the quality of the course depends HIGHLY on who's teaching it. Do your research first."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["somewhat disorganized, definitely take 249 instead of 149 since 149 students get the short end of the stick w.r.t. workload. definitely don't take it when more than 1 professor is teaching it.","This class focuses on the basics of generalized linear modeling, and is not recommended if you aim to learn about new methodological advances in modeling discrete data.","Don't be intimidated by Prof. Meng! He's a kitten at heart.","Please think about data more carefully rather than just use the model","If you want a practical course, check who is teaching the class.  Xiao-Li only wants to teach theory","The material is interesting but not the most useful stats course you can take. If Professor Meng is the only teacher, then you will have some problems. Also, if it's mixed with 249 and the 249 students teach at the end, you will have problems. I wish the most experienced and prepared teachers lectured all the time.","Professor Cleary and Paul Baines are reasons to take this class.  If both are involved next year, I would definitely recommend signing up."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["fair amount of work","Want to learn how to model anything you want with stats?  This is the class for you.  Want to do something exciting?  Maybe this isn't the one you want.","This is the best statistics course I've seen in the department.  The pace can be slow for some, but the lectures and expectations for the assignments are extremely clear.","I thought this was a wonderful statistics class. Unlike many other statistics classes that seem more theoretically-based, I thought it was great that this course was very firmly grounded in data analysis. Ie - as a student in the natural sciences, I feel that I really learned useful statistical techniques that I can apply in my research.","Spend a lot of time on the more theoretical aspects of the class. Read the book, possibly both books (McCullagh-Nadler in addition to \"Sleuth\". )","doesn't require much of work, worth taking if you want to learn the basics of statistics","I didn't learn anything in this class. There are undergrads and PhD students in a class that should definitely be split up and tailored to the differences in skill level."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Could be a great course for all, but was often difficult to follow.","You learn a lot of statistics in a disorganized but friendly atmosphere.","The class could be more tightly organized.  The assignments were very good, but Natesh's lectures need sharpening (which is understandable given that his was his first shot, but he's got to work at it). Cold calling class members was a GOOD thing.","There was no syllabus and no class emails were ever sent.  If the Prof. assigns homework in class and you missed lecture that day, you are just out of luck.","Fantastic professor teaching material that is absolutely essential to any statistician's education.  If you want to do any kind of real applied statistical analysis, this course is an absolute must.  This year was the first year that Natesh taught the course, and there were a lot of organizational confusion as to how it would be run, which persisted throughout the course.  In the grand scheme of things, however, that's the easiest thing to fix in any course, and hopefully they'll have the kinks ironed out in the future.","This class is an extremely important, practical class amongst all the offerings of the Stat department.  Natesh has a deep understanding and teaches well and has a style that requires participation from the whole class.","At this stage the course is poorly organized."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is a great class! As currently taught, VERY little work and VERY easy, but you learn a TON of interesting and useful models. Without reservation, a must take!","you only need one regression class and this one could definitely be it. glickman is a fun teacher who cares a lot about preparing good lectures and notes and generally produces a class that teaches you a good skill set. the theory itself is pretty simple and the class is very manageable.","Go to lecture. Preview your lecture notes beforehand and bring all the questions you might have. This is a fun, relaxing course. Stat 139 or Econ 1123 is a must, but if you really want to understand the concept behind the models and such, then should take Stat 110 and 111 concurrently as well.","This course is great if you are interested in statistical modeling.  It was not too difficult, assignments and exams were very fair, and Mark is a good lecturer.","will cover a huge amount of very useful tools.","If you want to fit a predictive model to almost any kind of dataset, ever, this class is for you. If you want a solid understanding of what GLMs are, why they exist, and what happens under the hood, then maybe not. \r\n\r\nGlickman's a cool guy, and he cares about his students, though, so class never felt boring.","This class taught me a lot of practical skills and tools in Statistics.  The breadth of the syllabus is wide and has equipped me with the ability to apply the methods we learned but also the working knowledge to study them in more depth later.","a very useful stats course","This is an awesome course. The homework is well-designed and the exam is fair.","This was one of my top 2 favorite classes at Harvard (and I took it as a senior). There are a LOT of grad students in this class, but don't be intimidated - at least for me, the undergrads did better on average. \r\n\r\nGlickman is a smart guy, and I strongly recommend this class!","Professor Glickman is great! He is very accessible outside class and is always willing to help you. He replies to emails very promptly and the replies are always very carefully written to answer any question you might have. I learned a lot in this class and I definitely recommend it!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Assignments were super easy but extremely long and tedious. The beginning is super easy material but then it picks up in terms of vague-ness. You learn a lot of things but don't really actually understand it. Grading is quite arbitrary (assignments only out of 5). Be ready for lots of interpretation questions that are graded fairly arbitrary.","Great course for anyone with an interest in applied statistics and advanced techniques for modeling.  Prof. Glickman is very enthusiastic and does a good job making the material fit together.","You should take the course if you want to have a solid foundation in linear models. Mark is a great guy and you can learn a lot from him.","This course is very practical and applied, emphasizing exposure to different models and the ways to apply each one.  The course gives better treatment to prediction than most courses in the department.","A very practical class in which you'll learn to build regression models on all sorts of data in R. The project at the end allows you to apply everything you've learned in creative ways, and was a highlight of the class. A great break from all the theoretical probability stuff at Harvard, although the problem sets were a little grind-y at points.","This is a solid course.  It isn't going to rock your world or anything, but it is definitely a good course to take and seems pretty applicable.  Professor Glickman is a good lecturer and seems like a really nice\/cool guy.  I wish my team had won the prediction competition because I would have liked to get a meal with him. \r\nThe course material is useful and the course isn't too tough.","Great course. Very straightforward and you learn a lot.","Extremely useful course! Great teacher and moderate workload.","This is an enjoyable course about GLMs, which is really the meat and potatoes of many statistics tasks in the real world. Even if you're the master of hierarchical Bayesian modeling and astronaut-level machine learning techniques, it would be highly embarrassing if you could not, for example, explain whether a logistic regression coefficient's magnitude was related to its statistical significance, or what multinomial regression is. This course filled in quite a few details for me.","This class teaches you some pretty useful material, although it can get boring at times (you spend a LOTTTT of time on logistic regression). Glickman is really nice, though he spends a lot of time explaining everything.","The lecture notes is very useful.","Very good overview of generalised linear modelling. Well taught with excellent course notes. Prof Glickman is enthusiastic, gives clear explanations and is readily available outside class. Definitely a class where the more you put in, the more you will get out.","This is a really easy class with very little content that moves at a glacial pace. In the first week of class, the prof literally spend half a lecture explaining to students that finding the maximum of f(x) is equivalent to finding the maximum of log(f(x)) because log is a monotonic function. However, the class is full of try-hard stat students and the grading is really hard-ass and they take off a lot of points if what you write isn't exactly what they were looking for. Also they give biweekly psets that are about as hard as weekly psets, but the psets are really annoying because it's a lot of repetitive trivial work. Remember when you took algebra 2 in high school and you had to graph all the polynomials and label all the intersections and max\/min and it was easy but took forever? Kind of like that. I took this class because smart people told me you learn so much in it, but I'm not sure if I will ever use anything I used in this class (even though I'm going into finance). Although I should be fair and say that Glickman seems like a nice guy who cares about his students, but even so it was a bad class.","Really good stats class--feels like you learn a lot without it being too burdensome. Also useful knowledge for the future","Highly recommend","A good introduction to a number of different types of models. Glickman's also great.","This class is a great extension of STAT 139 - with both of those I feel that I have a wide array of data analysis techniques at my disposal.  I particularly like that Professor Glickman expands beyond the range of typical GLMs to cover generalized additive models and tree-based models, which are very useful but don't fit into the GLM framework.","You will learn many applications of many different statistical tests.","This is a great course. Mark is an incredibly clear lecturer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso much so that if you're not getting something, you know it must be you. His lecture notes are pristine, and it is clear that he cares an incredible amount about the course. \r\n\r\nThe course is structured in a very logical way, first teaching you how to generalize the assumption that data is normal so that one can deal with poisson, multinomial, gamma, etc., data, and then teaching more advanced techniques (e.g., random forests). You will leave the course comfortable working with data from a wide variety of applications, as showcased by his examples in lecture, ranging in topic from election outcomes to the sandwich preferences of ants. \r\n\r\nAlso, this was my first regression course, and I found that to be okay. The Stat 139 prerequisite is not a huge deal, as gaps in knowledge are filled in quickly when jumping straight into generalized linear models.","- You spend the first half of the course on logistic regression.\r\n- Thorough overview of some useful methods. Overall lighter workload.\r\n- Glickman is very accessible and very clearly presents the material.\r\n- Probably not necessary to go to lecture; notes are very thorough.\r\n- Start on the final project early to take advantage of submissions structure.","Material is useful and well-presented by Professor Glickman. He is an effective lecturer and the lecture notes are effective and clear. The end-of-year Kaggle competition is a blast as well. Would highly recommend this class, and would recommend that the class is made harder!","This was maybe my favorite stats course I've taken here. I loved it! The problem sets take a decent amount of time, but it's not bad if you space them out. You learn a whole lot without really realizing how much you've learned, which is awesome.","GLMs is a really thorough introduction to GLMs that does a good job of covering both theory and practice. Highly recommended for a solid background in generalized linear models.","Great class! If you're a stats concentrator, definitely take this course because it is so useful\/applicable, and Glickman is literally the best! The course isn't easy but it's definitely very manageable and you learn a lot!","This is an excellent course. If you want a good grounding in frequentist statistics, then this is a bit of a must. The lectures and accompanying notes are clear and easy to follow, and the workload isn't too heavy. Mark brings a lot of passion to the classes, and he and the tfs are very helpful in office hours.","This is the course to take to understand beyond \"simple\" linear model; you'll know what R is doing when you analyze data after taking this class!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"55","response rate":"74.55","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 149","course_id":"4839","cat_num":"6617","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"14","5s":"24"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 149","course_id":"4839","cat_num":"6617","1s":"3","2s":"9","3s":"26","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 149","course_id":"4839","cat_num":"6617","1s":"4","2s":"22","3s":"11","4s":"4","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
