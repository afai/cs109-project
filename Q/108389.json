Intro to astro type course.","This is a great introduction to astrophysics. It is very light in terms of workload; the weekly set of questions can be completed in a couple minutes, and the two essays are quite short (one and two pages). The class sessions are really enjoyable. Avi is quite a renowned astrophysicist, and he is very eager to share his expansive knowledge; I greatly enjoyed the experience. He goes in depth with his explanations, and they are quite mathematical, but there is not the expectation that you will be able to replicate his mathematical reasoning. Overall, a highly recommended freshman seminar!","The subject is very interesting and Avi is a great scientists who is able to explain and generate interests for fundamental physical concepts in a language that is totally understandable. However, the course is a little too easy, in that there are no real assignments so you are not motivated to do any in-depth analysis of the material. So, if you are really looking for an easy but interesting course, this is it. If you'd like something more in-depth in Astrophysics, another course may be a better option. But, that being said, this little taste of cosmology inspired me to try to do a minor in Astrophysics, so that taste could be enough.","This class is really interesting! You'll learn a lot because you aren't facing the pressure of exams and problem sets that force material down your throat.  You can just listen to Avi Loeb talk and take it all in. Great class!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a good course to take if you want to learn a great deal without the pressure. As long as you truly engage in the coursework and readings, you will be prepared to complete the relatively short problem sets.","This course is very difficult as an introduction to astrophysics but it is completely worth it just to get to know Avi.","This seminar was very interesting, but it was also very easy to handle in a tough schedule. It may be a little bothersome for a couple weeks of the term, but it is the perfect seminar to take with a tough course load."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"1.10","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"11","response rate":"72.73","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 21g","course_id":"1766","cat_num":"74245","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 21g","course_id":"1766","cat_num":"74245","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 21g","course_id":"1766","cat_num":"74245","1s":"7","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
