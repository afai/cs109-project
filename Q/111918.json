There seems to be a lack of focus and the course touches upon a plethora of topics but at a very shallow level--it would be more interesting and beneficial for learning if the course took a slower pace and the time spanned covered was decreased so as to allow a better comprehension of the important issues.","One of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. Maybe the best.","This class changed the way I think about religion.","Ali Asani is a wonderful professor and this course is really well put together! Take it if you are interested in Islam or South Asia at all.","This class is Fabulous! Take anything with Ali Asani!","For those interested in South Asian Islam, this class is necessary.","The class is interesting, but a bit disorganized."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I enjoyed this course because I was interested in the materials been covered. The course is well structured, and Prof. Asani makes great effort to know his students and helps them tailor what they want to take away from the course.","This class has changed the way I think about the effect religion has on culture, politics and society. If you at all interact with religion in scholarship, the skills you learn in this class will help you have a more complete picture.","Learning from Professor Asani is such a treat!","This class truly teaches you about the world and how religion is still a huge cultural force behind culture and society, both past and present."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.20","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"5","response rate":"80.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ISLAMCIV 178","course_id":"5111","cat_num":"2741","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RELIGION 1820","course_id":"5111","cat_num":"2741","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"7","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ISLAMCIV 178","course_id":"5111","cat_num":"2741","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
