Some big names teach the course and as a result they offer a lot of fascinating and unique perspectives.

Ed's handouts on models are very useful. Everything Jeff presents is great.","Best to take if you want to do public economics as a field.

Don't plan on learning very much about the public economics literature."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The class helps present some possibly interesting areas of research in public economics.","This class is so disorganized; each lecturer just talks about the topics he 'feels' is relevant without putting things together in the bigger picture."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["You kind of need to be a PF nerd.
