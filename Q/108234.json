It's intellectual history, philosophy, literature all in one. You feel like you're tackling the material and trying to understand it alongside the profs, which is awesome.","W.E.B Du Bois is one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century, and certainly one of the great founders of African-American studies, though his writings and theories go beyond whatever parameters some may perceive in the phrase \"Af-Am Studies.\" Like a Marx, like a Foucault, he is essential reading to understand modernity, and the concept of race, and a lot of what we take for granted intellectually today. We spend a lot of time re-inventing the wheel in academia--if we read Du Bois more, maybe we would do that less. I recommend taking this course so that you can know something REALLY worth knowing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.33","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AFRAMER 135x","course_id":"49","cat_num":"50691","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AFRAMER 135x","course_id":"49","cat_num":"50691","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AFRAMER 135x","course_id":"49","cat_num":"50691","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
