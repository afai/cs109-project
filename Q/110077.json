That is NOT a criticism: on the contrary, what Prof. Hasty models is a form of academic pursuit in which the dialogue is central.  If you put your mind to it, you can shape a conversation from the pieces which are already there.  It does take practice, and that practice is built into the course.","This class has made me think about the big questions, not just those concerning music, but those concerning life. This may sound romantic but I do believe that music plays a fundamental role in our experience of life and due to Professor Hasty's open-mindedness and thought-provoking interpretation of music and philosophy, I feel as though I have been given the opportunity to think about the questions that most concern me. This class provides the opportunity for its participants to take risks and think big."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"5","response rate":"60.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 230rs","course_id":"11044","cat_num":"89653","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 230rs","course_id":"11044","cat_num":"89653","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
