There's a lot of homework that takes a long time to do, and you have to master a lot in a short period of time--it can definitely be stressful."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It is a great opportunity to really delve into the nuts and bolts of Turkish grammar. My reading, writing, and grammar skills greatly improved after taking this course.","Volume of material covered does not logically correspond with allocated course time. THERE WAS NO TIME TO DIGEST RECEIVED MATERIAL ESPECIALLY IN CASE OF GRAMMAR.\r\nCourse meets FIVE hours a week EVERYDAY. \r\nCourse requires a minimum of TWO HOURS of daily preparation (homework (daily), vocab quiz (weekly), 300 word essay (weekly), quiz (bi-weekly)","The professor is intelligent and well-intentioned, but the class is very ineffectively organized. Large amounts of work served as a substitute for pedagogy.  It was frustrating to deal with a structure that damaged my grasp of the material rather than enhanced it. This course could benefit from a thoughtful restructuring of the rate at which material is taught. The workload is such that only those who have lived in Turkey or are expecting to live in Turkey will have enough willpower to finish it; this course is not for those with a casual interest in the subject."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"3.50","difficulty":"4.00","recommendation":"3.00","enrollment":"6","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"TURKISH 120b","course_id":"3890","cat_num":"1394","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"TURKISH 120b","course_id":"3890","cat_num":"1394","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"TURKISH 120b","course_id":"3890","cat_num":"1394","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
