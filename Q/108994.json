'12":{"comments":["take the section component seriously, it can be really informative.","It's a required class for BBS.","It will go well if you really prepare and are ready to contribute when you come to section.","Does not really need marketing - it's mandatory and it's good.","It is painful to read papers outside of your field of interest and \"classic\" papers. But doing so will dramatically increase your ability to critically evaluate scientific work.","It consumes a lot of time while providing little benefit.","If the course readings remain similar, I only recommend this course to someone with strong interest in molecular biology.","It is a lot of work and there is much required of you, but the breadth of background information and methods you are exposed to makes it worth the time.  Everything depends on your section and faculty leaders so it is a great break when you switch because you read papers with a different eye depending on what is expected of you.","You're satisfaction is completely up in the air, depending on your section leaders and students.","It is difficult, but worth it.","Very important preparatory class for the rest of graduate school.","Helps you decrease the time it takes for you to read and comprehend a complex paper.","The course is an excellent opportunity to enhance critical reading skills and to discuss science.  However, it is very time consuming, both in terms of class time and preparation time.","While I appreciate the time that the faculty take each week to discuss these papers, there is rarely any explanation of why these particular papers were chosen and what larger lesson we should learn from them- an explicit explanation would be helpful.","-- I learned a lot, but this class made my semester very stressful","Course is required, so recommendation really does not matter","This class helped me to not be intimidated when reading primary literature. I feel confident that I can tackle any scientific paper after this course.","Don't be afraid to speak up because the silences are very awkward. Be sure to do background reading.","This course provides an essential foundation in reading and critically assessing scientific literature.  Every biology graduate student should take this kind of course.","Your experience will be dependent on your assigned faculty for your sections.  You will get out of the course what you put into it.  Reading only the 2 weekly assigned papers is not enough; you should at least skim through a few other background papers as well.","Overall, it's a good class. I learned a lot!","BBS 230 greatly enhanced my ability to critically evaluate scientific literature by exposing me to several fields that I am not necessarily familiar with. This is definitely an essential course to take as a graduate student in biomedical science.","Absolutely worth trying. The harder you work, the more you get out of it.","It is incredibly important to carefully read the assigned papers and participate actively in the discussion group. Reading a great deal of background material is not as important as participating in  the discussions.","Discussions were helpful even if articles were sometimes painful to read.","You get out of it what you put into it - read the papers thoroughly before class and come prepared with questions and you'll learn a lot from the discussions.","This is a course designed for graduate students in the life sciences, where you will learn how to dissect and understand research articles, and I would discourage anyone who does not fall in that category from taking this course.","The course is worth every moment of it. It will improve your paper reading and analyzing skills remarkably","This class teaches you how to interact with professors and peers in a small class setting. It teaches you how to critically read papers and to analyze interpretations.","The class is useful, but will take a lot of time. Make sure to start early on reading each week."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Gives good overview of analysing literature, but what you learn varies between section leaders.","It is a lot of work, but it may be the most useful class you take in graduate school in terms of learning skills that you need on a daily basis.","There are many interesting ways to become a better scientist. This is probably not one of them.","I'm astounded by how much I learned in this course!","This course is a good forum for a journal club\/seminar.  Hopefully this isn't your first experience reading literature critically and discussing it among peers, but if it is it's a good introduction.  It only works if you (1) read the papers and (2) participate in the discussion.  And if you do those two, it works very well.","The more you prepare the papers for this course, the more you will get out of this class. Be sure to speak up and class and express your open opinions about the paper, even if you think they are incorrect.","If you focus on learning how to read primary biological literature from the instructors this can be a very enjoyable and valuable course.","It's challenging, but it's very valuable.","You'll get as much out of the course as you put into it.","This is a good, essential course. If the paper selection was like 2013-2014 fall; you might enjoy the course most if you are interested in biochemistry\/cell biology","Be prepared to feel like you know nothing and to have to read a whole lot and feel like it's never enough. Welcome to grad school.","Read papers several days in advance.\r\nLook up review papers that give a simpler overview of the topic before delving into the papers.","One of the most beneficial courses as a graduate student because it teaches you how to critically analyze a paper, which will be very helpful when preparing for your PQE and future literature researching in general.","Good course that introduces you to thinking critically about scientific paper: not every Science, Nature, Cell paper is accurate. To get the most out of the class, make sure to understand the benefits and downfalls of the techniques used in the paper, and speak up in class: if you feel like you have something to contribute, don't hesitate to get it out there.","This course helped me to develop and further refine my approach to criticism of relevant literature, to broaden my exposure to both new and old techniques, and to appreciate some significant papers in their historical contexts.","Discussions depends very much on who is in the group and on who is leading it.","Teaches you how to read papers critically and think about future research. Your experience may vary widely depending on the student group and instructor.","This class is very time consuming and expect to spend a lot of time\/effort reading, looking up background info, etc. But it is very informative and beneficial if you put the time into it.","I hope you like vesicle trafficking.","It's a very challenging and time consuming course but discussions with the faculty members and exposure to different fields and techniques will really make you a better scientist and critical thinker.","It is likely a required course, but I think it is a good way to get exposed to literature in different fields.","The course will really allow you to develop paper reading skills and get you used to combing through the primary literature. It is representative of what you might need to do in research, in that it doesn't just give you great, seminal papers to read, but also recent, convoluted, and poorly written papers to work your way through and critique.","Great way to elevate literature reading skills and sharpen writing - both very relevant to graduate life.","This class is a lot of work; you will definitely need to read the papers closely and critically and come prepared to discussion. That said, it's totally worth it. You will learn a lot from this class in terms of how to look at papers critically and how to pick out the most important and relevant information even with only one read-through."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Great way to learn to challenge the literature.","Read any reviews that include the paper and were released around when the paper was published because they will be helpful in aiding you to understand the paper.","Take the Tuesday section seriously. I think it is a good outlet to express questions or concerns that will make the Thursday section better.","This is a required course for the BBS program, and is useful in advancing your ability to read the biological literature critically. I think that what you take away from the course is proportional to the amount of effort you put in. Read the papers, look briefly at background material, reviews and accompanying comments and think about the limitations of the paper, techniques and study design if you'd like to fully benefit from the course.\n\nThe (Thursday) sessions with faculty are more engaging, as people would have read the papers by then (in addition to participation in these sessions being 50% of the course grade). The Tuesday sessions with the teaching fellows were less productive in terms of the breadth and depth of discussion.\n\nCoursework-wise: there are no weekly assignments - only take-home mid-term and final examinations - these were useful exercises in critical writing on specific papers, though more feedback on these exams would have been beneficial in enhancing the value of the course.","Painful but useful learning experience in developing your critical thinking","Be thorough in your preparation, it is worth it.","Helps you develop skills to critically apraise literature in a discussion-based manner, which was very effective; also exposes you to a wide variety of literature which is very useful in the future when reading these papers","This class teaches you how to read scientific papers critically and talk about science effectively with colleagues.  Both of which are incredibly important skills for a scientist.","anyone who had prior research experience should not be mandated to take this course","It is challenging and frustrating when you aren't interested in the paper topic, but you learn a lot about different parts of biology and become A LOT better at reading papers and interpreting data.","It's a good class, and you can get as little or as much out of it as you want, depending on what you put in","Read reviews related to the paper assigned in addition to the paper itself.","I would tell them to not be intimidated by the instructor sessions.","To read a lot of background and discuss well with classmates before attending either of the sections. Be prepared to ask questions.","Read papers. It's like vitamins for your brain.","Please read the papers for Tuesday section and actually come prepared. You don't have to spend 10 hours on each paper, but it's a good idea to try and understand the methods.","Very useful and helps develop skills you'll definitely need as a scientist","Don't stress out about it. Things will be okay.","This course is all dependent on the faculty that you have and the students who are in your class.","Budget tons and tons of time.","It isn't necessary to understand every tiny detail of the paper and its method.  Don't be afraid to ask questions or try to clear up points of confusion in the faculty session--it is a valid way to participate in the discussion.","Paper-reading is an extremely valuable skill, and so is the ability to introduce yourself to a field. This is a great class for learning these skills, and you also learn a lot of biology.","It's a pretty big time commitment but quite valuable. I expected this class to be some sort of \"how to read papers\" pedantry, but in fact, it proved to be a deep dissection of methods and historical context of a lot of important biology, and was engaging every week.","It is a great class to develop skills to better analyze and interpret research articles in biology. It gives you the toolbox with which one can focus more on important aspects of analyzing articles."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.70","workload":"6.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"50","response rate":"86.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"BBS 230","course_id":"2938","cat_num":"36968","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"11","4s":"20","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"BBS 230","course_id":"2938","cat_num":"36968","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"31","4s":"15","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"BBS 230","course_id":"2938","cat_num":"36968","1s":"3","2s":"22","3s":"9","4s":"2","5s":"4"}},"success":true}
