The course is well taught and the material is fascinating.","If you can stand the three-hour lectures followed immediately by the hour-long section, you will love this class, as the material is engaging and the professors are wonderful, and the topics discussed will change the way you study and sleep.  If, instead, you have an attention-span less like a robot and more akin to that of the rats - or let's face it, even the humans - used in most of the experiments discussed, every Wednesday you will rue your decision to take MCB 186.","This course has a very conceptual, versus mathematical, approach to the science of circadian biology. It opens doors to hours of interesting discourse with classmates and roommates and friends as well providing ample research and thesis ideas.","very interesting class with low stress and workload"]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["This is a great class if you like the topic. It's not a field of study that most biologists would be familiar with, so it's ripe for interdisciplinary studies. Teachers are very accommodating.","The course is both fun and interesting if you're at all interested in the biology of sleep.","A very good introduction to circadian biology.","Very interesting subject regardless of concentration, well - presented and professors are for the most part engaging. The workload is not heavy although some of it seems unrelated or unnecessary.","Take advantage of the small class size and access to lots of great professors\/lecturers - participating in class helped me get so much more out of this class."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Take it! (if you are looking for an interesting biology class). It will change the way you think about sleep (if you've previously thought about sleep at all).","Very interesting course material that can actually be applied to real life. Chuck is super nice\/polite and a great teacher. Field trip to the sleep lab was really fun. The Tf was especially helpful for feedback on the final project.","The material is interesting, but this year, there was a disparity between the lecture material (no problems covered, just presentation-style of research) and the problem sets (these problems were not covered in detail in lecture and thus my classmates and I ended up having to look up papers on PubMed to figure it out).","A really great science elective; it surprises me that more people don't take it. The material is very applicable to daily life, and the small size means that you get a lot of useful feedback. I would especially recommend this course for underclassmen who are interested in the topic of sleep and health and are looking for labs- it's a great introduction to the field, and the instructors really encourage students to get involved. \r\n\r\nThe course is not difficult (Exams are take-home, so you don't have to memorize the material, and I felt that the necessary concepts were explained very well.) but I would note that you need to be prepared to stay on top of your work from week to week (you write a one-page review each week and have very short weekly problem sets).","Take it! Everyone sleeps, so you might as well learn about it, it will totally change the way you think about your all-nighters and crazy sleep schedules.","This class is the small seminar class that you were promised coming into Harvard. The professors are incredible, and the lecturers are the leaders in their field. The material was very interesting and it was a very low time commitment course- I would definitely recommend this class.","Hands down the best course I have taken at Harvard. The instructors put in a great deal of effort getting all the experts in the field to present their area of interest. The course is small, which makes the lecture very enjoyable because there is ample opportunity for questions and discussions.  I thought a perfect amount of molecular biology was used in the course; I am glad courses like these exist for MCB concentrators because a lot of times it is depression to discuss molecular mechanisms all day. I'm sure a lot of concentrators feel the same way. The classroom environment is very chill but that doesn't come at the cost of learning a great deal about this absolutely fascinating subject."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Take it! Interesting and fun.","A superb course, highly recommended! Circadian rhythms (and sleep!) are something that undergrads take for granted all too often. Take this course, and let some awesome, cutting-edge professors and a very helpful TF teach you about the importance of circadian disruption and sleep, the risks or disrupting these cycles, and how you can help others (and yourself) stay healthy","Love the class, but it is challenging. Take it if you are interested in the topic!","This course is really interesting and well taught! The professors are really invested in the course, and I definitely learned a lot about sleep and circadian biology (not just the science, but also implications of sleep research). Probably one of the best courses I've taken here!","Take this class (but don't tell other people to or it'll get too crowded)! You get to really understand how sleep works, and you have the LEADERS in the field talking to you about it. Chuck is a great lecturer and very accessible. Andrew (the TF) is awesome. Take home midterms\/finals aren't easy, but they aren't the death of you either.","Take this class. It has been my favorite science class since coming to Harvard. Dr. Czeisler is SO COOL. And you are very lucky if Andrew is still the TF!","The subject matter in this class is really interesting a lot of the time, and the core teaching staff (especially Dr. Czeisler and Andrew Phillips) are wonderful, but the course feels rather disjointed with all the guest lectures (which are very hit or miss) and does require a substantial amount of work. I think the class was likely better in the past when it was a lot smaller in size to allow for more discussion\/participation.","This class covers very interesting material that, while much of it could be found online, is rarely taught in an undergraduate setting. Sleep and circadian rhythms are in many ways two of the hot fields now, and it's funny how many people I meet are really interested to hear about the class. The assignments are graded kind of tough, but not unreasonably tough, and really my only reservation is the fact that it meets for 3 hours. I had a rough semester (Chem 17 and MCB 52) so the reduced sleep made 3 hours straight, in the middle of the afternoon after lunch no less, very difficult for me. But if you don't think the length of the class will be a problem for you, than by all means take it.","This class is probably the most interesting science course I have taken at Harvard. You'll leave amazed at how much sleep affects every facet of your life and the lives of people around you. I highly recommend it, but make sure you put in the time for this course. It is tempting to put off work\/do work last minute for a course that only meets once a week, but it is more difficult than previous Q comments would suggest. Andrew is a wonderful TF and always willing to help, so I highly suggest going to him before assignments to make sure you understand the  material. The exams are a bit of a time-crunch because you are only given 12 hours (but the exams themselves don't seem to have been shortened from the previous 48 hour allowance) so plan accordingly--they aren't a walk in the park. Despite the somewhat difficult coursework, I think the material and amazing professors and guest lecturers alone are worth taking this course for.","Not too difficult, but at times the material can be confusing. The professors are great. Overall, it is a pretty chill class."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The material for this course was interesting but be prepared to spend a lot of time on course work.","Be prepared to do lots of work. You will learn a lot of fundamental concepts of circadian biology but it will come with blood, sweat, and tears. And lots of it.","Take this course, but do not assume it is easy despite some adviser's recommendations. The course requires a time commitment between 3 hour lectures, reading, presentations, and problem sets. In exchange, you learn from the best about a part of medicine that is oft overlooked and tremendously important. Great class to take, especially because of the discussion format, but that also means you have to be alert and awake, ironically.","First and foremost, this class is fascinating. Circadian biology is so pertinent to the every day life of the college student that I still find myself obnoxiously telling everyone about what I learned in the class. You learn a good amount, but there are some caveats to the class. It really is a serious commitment, in the sense that there is every type of assignment imaginable (final proposal, midterm, final exam, problem sets, critical reviews of papers) and none of them are easy completion grades. The majority of the class got maybe 80% on most of the assignments. This shouldn't deter you from taking the class because it really pushes you to improve the precision of your scientific thinking and writing, but it does also make it kind of stressful fro week to week. In terms of what you learn, you hear from many guest lecturers so it's a little bit disjointed and a lot of them are unsure as to what you already know. They're all interesting individually but an overall thrust of the course is less clear.","Great course! Extremely interesting and well put together.","Very interesting course. Lots of amazing guest lecturers from the top of the field. Enough work to make you keep up with the material, but not too much as to take all your time for the week.","Great course! Prof. Czeisler was amazing and the weekly guest lectures were all very enjoyable. Constant stream of work with weekly problem sets and critical reviews, but learned a lot about the subject. Probably the best MCB course I've taken.","The beginning part of the course is a little dry but gets better toward the end. Good overview of sleep biology and sleep-related diseases."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MCB 186","course_id":"3562","cat_num":"2854","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"8","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MCB 186","course_id":"3562","cat_num":"2854","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"6","4s":"0","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MCB 186","course_id":"3562","cat_num":"2854","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
