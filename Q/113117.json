'07":{"comments":["It's a challenge, but well worth it."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["if you want to know about the theories of art history, take this class!  also, if you are an art historian, the theories are probably a good thing to know!","You have to prepared to work the hardest you have at Harvard, but will learn a tremendous amount. It should only be for very serious HAA concentrators.","Be prepared to read a lot of stuff that doesn't make a whole lot of sense the first read-through.","This is a requirement for anyone concentrating in HAA, so it's not exactly something you recommend\/don't recommend.  But overall it was not as painful as I had been led to believe it would be.","It's a required course, so I can't really recommend it to other concentrators. But I found the course interesting and will be useful in my future art history courses."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["It depends on your section leader, but if your class is approximately 10 students and you have an interested leader, you will have great and memorable discussions.","Being prepared for class is extremely important, because it allows you to discuss the material at a high level.  If you don't put in the time before class, you will not get very much out of it.","Do the reading each week! Also, after reading and participating in class - sit down for 10 minutes and bullet out the take-away points from each theorist. Quick phrases will keep you from getting all the names muddled.","it's hard","far more enjoyable than sophomore tutorial, this course provides a comprehensive introduction to various theories and methods of analysis in art history, with a strong emphasis on intellectual thought and improvement of writing skills","Useful if not always the most interesting of art history classes.","Students should make use of the rich  methodological resources which the coursework provides for future art historical research. It is a very helpful class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Ana really is a dedicated teacher, but she seems to have a very fixed idea about what texts say, and does not allow any comprises. She seemed to disagree with what most people had to say too often, and I did not feel like it was a very encouraging learning environment.","Its required, it's not as bad as you think. Get a read on the TF's before committing to a section, they dictate the whole thing and many times their syllabi are different.","The response papers do take time.  Try not to leave them to the last minute!","Elizabeth is an incredible TF and it is a very rewarding course.  I feel more confident as an academic in the discipline of art history."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course is a great way of finding your voice as an architectural theorist and lets you take a stance in some very important debates.  You will be exposed to seminal works.","I adored this class, Farshid was wonderful to work with, and the material was diverse and really fun to talk about.","Material was really interesting and thought provoking.  Long discussions but productive and fun!  If you want to discuss architecture and the built environment from all angles, you will love this class.","You have to take this if you're in HAA. In a good way.","The course shaped the way I think about the built environment.","I had a lot of fun in this class. Some of the methodologies (and art historians) you'll read about are contentious, and it was great debating the pros and cons of these different approaches in class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Methods is vital. It changes the way you understand the concentration and how you will perform future work.","Fun tutorial where you can talk in a smaller group.","It's mandatory if you're an art history concentrator.","Methods was seriously one of the best experiences I've had at Harvard. It was incredibly important to begin to think critically about what the discipline of art history can and should mean. It was also very exciting to be not allowed but encouraged to push back against the thinking of those in the field.","Oliver is a fabulous TF, one of the best I've had in art history to date. Take methods with him even if it means rearranging your entire schedule. You will not regret it!","If done well, you can learn a lot from Methods. Not necessarily the history of art history, but the benefits and limits of approaches. It's good for self-reflecting on practices and thus improving research."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Be prepared! This is a mandatory course for concentrators, and depending on how well you absorb and understand the material, it'll really make a difference in your career in the concentration. That being said, don't be discouraged when\/if you don't understand certain methodologies.","Think about your case study early. Do not get stuck doing all of the research in reading period. Come to the colloquium with real questions about how to make your paper better.","Extremely interesting, deep exploration of key methods of analysis in architectural history.  David set the bar high for the calibre of discussion, and was very supportive in helping us generate our own ideas for our final project.  Crucial class.","Such a wonderful semester's worth of reading, discussion, and case studies! The preparation for the final paper is very well planned by David and as a result we did not have to write it in a moment of panic. The colloquium was one of the best parts of the class as well!","The methods tutorial is one of the best courses I took at Harvard. The workload is dense, but the coures is extremely rewarding. I got introduced to the various discourses and approaches to art history, which was not only interesting but also broadened my perspective and helped me to find my own style. Ruthie is an amazing teacher, and gave very helpful advice along the tutorial."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"6.30","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"11","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HAA 98br","course_id":"2554","cat_num":"3507","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HAA 98br","course_id":"2554","cat_num":"3507","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HAA 98br","course_id":"2554","cat_num":"3507","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
