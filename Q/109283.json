Steady amount of work (read papers before every class) but interesting papers, good environment for discussion. Professor Grosz and Ofra are very supportive and accessible\/flexible.","This is a great seminar. I have taken many Harvard courses in which I have felt that after I had completed the readings, I gained nothing by going to class. This is not one of them -- Professor Grosz in particular imparts a great intuition for how to design research such that it has the most impact on a discipline."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 280r","course_id":"5285","cat_num":"11199","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 280r","course_id":"5285","cat_num":"11199","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 280r","course_id":"5285","cat_num":"11199","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
