Who woulda thought. If you put in the time, you can emerge from the course with something that will later become publishable.","Excellent class. Explore your own research questions while hearing about current research projects in the field of evolutionary dynamics.","Martin Nowak and everyone at PED do really interesting and diverse research, and Math 243 is a great window into their world. There's something in the class for everyone, and it's also a great way to get into research yourself in their group.","Awesome course. Each week there's a fascinating lecture, and other than that, you just work on an independent research project. There's a lot of freedom in topic choice, and you can have as much or as little guidance as you want. If you're an undergraduate, definitely consider taking Math 153 first.","Martin is the best!","Take this class! There is literally no reason not to. PED has put significant work towards making learning about mathematical biology very easy for undergrads to do, even if you have a hard workload outside of class.","very easy going class, lots of interesting talks","This is a great opportunity to do real original research in pretty much any math-related topic! You also get to pair up with a graduate student\/post-doc as a mentor, which is super helpful! The work that the PED does is really broad, and it's all really interesting!","This is not a general 'lecture style' course in evolutionary dynamics or evolutionary game theory (the university sorely lacks such a course). It's great if one wants to get involved in research that is broadly related to evol. dynamics.","Wonderful class. The only work is a research project, which you can do on your own schedule. they have some really interesting research projects and provide a lot of guidance."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.40","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"27","response rate":"59.26","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 243","course_id":"2894","cat_num":"8136","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 243","course_id":"2894","cat_num":"8136","1s":"1","2s":"7","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 243","course_id":"2894","cat_num":"8136","1s":"8","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
