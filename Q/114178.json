Besides just being fun and good social conversation for outside of class, I feel like the take home points and learning about the results of some crazy psych studies are very relevant to how you carry out your life.","Loved it.  Hilarious and entertaining lectures and fascinating material.","It's really fascinating, the courseload is light, the exams are easy if you do the reading and go to lecture, and the project is fun.","Professor Greene's lectures were very interesting and really funny.

You could learn this stuff from the book. It's fun, but not really worth the time.","It is a good class but watch out for the frustrating multiple-choice exams.","If you want to know more about the human mind especially in a social context, you should take this course. It will be far more valuable and useful than any math, science, or philosophy course.","This class will help you be more successful in every day life, understand the world and yourself better, be a better parent\/friend\/spouse, and above all, make you question what you do and why you do it.  Take this class!","Very interesting.","fun stuff, easy.","It's easy to fall behind by skipping lectures because they are up online, but it is so much better just to go, because the lectures are really fun and half the tests are based of them, so go! Also, ask for help on things like the project, the staff is generally very positive and willing to help out.","It's a really good class that teaches you a lot about human nature.","the topics are very interesting and relevant to everyday life, prof. Greene is clear and entertaining, you will learn a lot from this class.\r\nstudy hard for the exams.","It's not very difficult, but you have to work hard to do well. The course stresses details of experiments in exams.","Take this class for an easy A and some interesting lectures, but don't expect to learn a whole lot, especially if you've already taken Psych 1.","Very fun and interesting class!  Prof. Greene is very funny and makes class enjoyable!","The material is almost comically simple and you will never be confused.  However, the class does not have enough TF's so it is done in tricky, unfair multiple choice question format.  I studied plenty and understood the material very well, but I performed very poorly on the test and so did a lot of my peers.  Not a very fair, well-run class in my opinion.","Boring class with an obnoxious instructor who stutters.","Make sure that you do the readings.","too much like psych 1","It's a really fun class!","Prof. Greene is great and the material is fun and easy to learn. The only thing that's a bit weird is the tests. They're all multiple choice, no essays or anything, so you really have to know the material, cause there's no such thing as partial credit on a multiple choice question.","--","The tests can be difficult, especially for how easy the class is.","It's so much fun!!","listening to Joshua Greene is really interesting and he gives very good lectures.  Also the material is fascinating.","Lots of overlap with Psych 1.\r\nProfessor Greene is interesting, funny, and well-organized.\r\nThe exams are of a difficult format.","This class is very interesting. The professor and TFs truly care about what they teach and for this reason, they get you excited about the subject matter as well.","Although interesting at times, I don't think this class is worth taking. The tests are unfair and I don't think the discipline of social psychology is cogent. With all the experiments discussed in lecture it is built up as more of a hard science... but I'd describe it more as the subjective study of common sense. The experiments frequently contradict each other, competing theories propose completely opposite patterns... it seems like a great struggle to define social phenomena in exact terms when they really don't lend themselves to being desribed that way.","Hope to Get Professor Greene","Great professor, fun topics, and really easy!  Definitely take it!","it is a fun class made to taught you not only psychology but real-life applications of psychology beyond the academic field","I wouldn't recommend it, except with reservations.","tests are harder than you would think","very fun and interesting. you learn a lot about yourself","It felt just like a rehash of introductory psychology, just in slightly different clothing.","This was a fantastically life-relevant course that can help give you a new perspective on how you approach daily life -- the manageable workload and significantly interesting material makes for a phenomenal class!","Be prepared to repeat psych 1, but a little more in depth.","Avoid if multiple choice tests aren't your thing.","Extremely interesting to learn the reasons why as human beings we do the things that we do.","Despite what he may say on the syllabus, the tests are all multiple choice.","I loved the professor and my TF, and I really feel like I learned a lot, and the things that you learn you can truly apply to your daily life and social interactions. It's cool!","The class is interesting and Professor Greene is an exciting lecturer.  However, section is boring and there's a lot of reading.","This has been my favorite class so far at Harvard.","Professor Greene is really fun to watch in lecture, and a generous grader of exams.  The class is not only painless, it's pleasurable.  And the research assignment is an excellent way to really explore a topic that is of interest to you in social psychology.","A hysterical class with practical applications! Greene was an incredible speaker!","Applicable to the world, and incredibly interesting","The class will introduce you to a host of interesting, unsettling, and unbelievable research done on no one but yourself. Let's face it: humans are most interested in themselves, and this class is all about you.","This is one of the most interesting courses (with real-life applications)  that I have taken. Highly recommend!","An interesting class with great lectures!","The material we learn in the course is so interesting and very applicable to daily life.\r\n\r\nProfessor Greene is like a stand-up comedian.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are by far the best part of the course (followed by the good textbook).","The Professor is hilarious and great, the reading is incredibly interesting, the final project is a lot of fun, and basically it's a good class to take for any concentration","intersting, good professor with funny jokes and \"e\" options on tests","painless class, interesting material, and interesting assignments."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["It's fun and interesting!

You should try to do the readings to correspond with the lectures (even though it's not entirely necessary) so that you don't end up cramming before the tests. The tests are geared towards key terms, so make sure you're good at flashcard memorization.

The studies are a bit redundant from Psych 1.","This class presented me with information that I always thought was interesting and applicable.

The hour and a half rarely dragged, and this is one of the first courses in which I actually took notes the whole time.

You won't look at people the same way after this class, but in a good way :)","It's a great course, especially for students interested in the interface between psychology and philosophy, because Professor Greene's background is in philosophy and he does research on moral decision making.","Very interesting class, goes a little deeper into what was covered in Psych 1 but there is a lot of overlap.","Great class, really fun and interesting, not too difficult.","This class is a great elective for anyone to take.","The lectures and material are fun, but make sure you study for the exams because there is a lot of information to recall.  Also, start your project early.","professor greene is hilarious! it's a solid class. with a rather large amount of evolutionary\/biology stuff.","The class is very interesting and definitely worth it even for non-psych concentrators.","Great class- material that could be applied to real life social situations.","This has, by far, been my favorite class at Harvard. Al of the themes of the course can be observed in the real world. It wasn't difficult to learn the concepts, as almost all of the social behaviors we were taught are relevant and visible in every day life. I left the class with a much greater understanding of what drives behavior in social settings and I learned it all without much work.

Maybe read one of the source books instead of taking this class if you were thinking about it for an elective. But Prof. Greene is great, and it's a fun course.","Best.class.ever","Take this class.  Everything about it is fantastic: Professor Greene, the TFs, the textbook, the assignments, the material, the slides, everything.  It gives you a really interesting perspective about yourself and the world around you (though it makes you paranoid that every single abnormality in daily life is an undercover psychology experiment).","Best class I have taken so far.

The project is fun, though.","This is a great option for anyone looking for an interesting and easy elective, and the material is really useful for real world experiences.","you learn about some really interesting things about human behavior, but take some of it cum grano salis","This class, like most or any psychology course, requires a lot of work and dedication and is not easy to do well in.","It's a really fun class with lots of interesting topics. You can control your grade pretty easily by reading all of the assignments and studying hard, and the final project is more of an intro to psychological research than an actual research paper.","Interesting subject matter. Great teaching staff.","Super fun class and really interesting - you'll love lectures. Also, exams aren't that difficult and there's not too much work out of class.","Psych 15 is great. Josh Greene is a fantastic, engaging professor with a good sense of humor. Watch out for a work-intensive research project at the end, but not too much reading on a day-to-day.","Great class to take as an elective; doing the reading and going to lectures is all you really need to do well in this course, and picking a research project that interests you makes it much more enjoyable.","This course is amazing. It really demonstrates the basic underpinnings in our social world. Must take class.","This is a great class.  Even if you don't think you are interested in the material, you'll find the studies so interesting.  Go to lecture!  It's great!","awesome class, teaches you a lot about society and social interactions, makes you question humanity but also tries to give you hope in humanity, good amount of work and time commitment.","Don't take if you have already taken upper level psychology classes. You will have learned about a lot of this, and heard most of the studies before, and lecture can be incredibly boring.","very interesting class, great lectures, painless, good culture, a lot of important insights into human nature","This class is so much fun, and you learn a ton of stuff that seems so APPLICABLE to life!","Very applicable to life!","If you pay attention in lectures it will be much easier.","Harsh grading.  Material is great to know though--it messes with your mind, you start seeing social psych experiments everywhere and are left always trying to diagnose your friends","This is a very enjoyable class, one that every Harvard student should think about taking before graduation. The lectures are really great and the exams are not as difficult as people make them out to be.","Relatively painfree class (just have to do the work but not too difficult) but very interesting material. Some of the material overlaps a lot with other areas of psychology though, so this is good as a beginning course.","A pleasure to go to lecture.","Amazing class! The only one I managed to stay awake and interested in during the entire lecture period. The professor's really engaging and funny. The material and the way its presented makes it a class you are willing to spend extra work in because it relates to your everyday life. Recommend for psych and non-psych concentrators!","It's pretty good. Especially if you like the material.","Its a solid tier 2 psych course that's very accessible to psych concentrators and non-psych concentrators alike. That being said, I feel like there are better, smaller, higher level psych classes offered","Great course. Very interesting material, light workload, fun project.","take this, you'll enjoy it.","Professor Greene is amazing and hilarious, the subject material is fascinating.  I absolutely loved this course.  Definitely gives you a new perspective and understanding of why people do things."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Loved it!  The courseload is manageable, the professor is an engaging lecturer, the TFs dedicated and available, and the research project due at the end can be as interesting and exciting as you make it.","Really fun and applicable class! You definitely start seeing how studies can be applied to real life and you better understand human behavior. Keep up with readings though. The exams sometimes have these really random terms you have to define.","This course was a great course and I would recommend it to anybody. Very interesting topic and it's all about people and how we function. If you are at all interested in psychology, you have to take this course. Professor Greene is a great lecturer and it was always enjoyable to go to his lectures. The only big assignment you have is to run your own observational study. This could be a great opportunity for you to gain some experience running a psych experiment.","This course is actually very interesting and well run! The lectures are entertaining as well as helpful. You learn a lot through the material.","This course gives a good understanding of general social psychology principles that any young adult should be aware of. The class is engaging and has the right amount of expectations.","painless but annoying","This course is so interesting and fun! Professor Green is a fantastic lecturer and makes the material really easy to comprehend. Grading is very fair and sections are ok. You'll come away with a lot more knowledge of the world and why people act the way they do. TAKE THIS COURSE!!","Really awesome course.  Great (light) workload that's still sufficient, fair tests, amazing material, entertaining lecturer, great TFs, and awesome projects.  I'm not a Psych major, but I really did love this course.","Great class! Greene is a fantastic and hilarious lecturer. Go to every lecture; you won't regret it. This was by far my favorite Harvard course so far.","This is a fun course where you can learn really cool things. The staff is AMAZING! So friendly & so nice! You should definitely take this course -- don't be scared about the research paper at the end. It's actually pretty fun & it's not bad at all, you get a lot of help from the TFs.","Professor Greene is one of the most entertaining and engaging lecturers at Harvard. Take this class! You will learn so much about why people do the things they do and be able to apply your knowledge to your own life.","There is a ton of overlap with SLS20 so it's helpful to have it as a pre-req though not necessary in my opinion.","This is an awesome, fun and easy course! Take it!","This class was a continuation of many topics from Gilbert's intro psych class, and not much new information was learned. It was enjoyable and entertaining enough and Greene explained interesting experiments, but overall the class is not particularly insightful or different enough from intro psych to make it worthwhile. Some of the topics aren't totally relevant so the class needs to be reformatted. Midterms are much more reasonable than Gilbert's and it's nice to revisit the material but again not distinct enough unfortunately. Creating our own experiment is also interesting and important but there needs to be a greater emphasis on it to be worthwhile as well.","lectures are awesome, the project is only good if you pick something extremely simple and observational","There is a lot here that is redundant with Psych 1, but Prof. Greene makes the material interesting and the paper \/ exams aren't difficult.","It is very interesting to learn of the various theories of social psychology.","Green is a great professor-take this class!","make sure you study the studies and lectures much more than the textbook","If you took SLS 20 with Gilbert, you basically already took this class. But it's fairly painless, the lectures are all posted online, easy sections, and you will learn some interesting information.","Professor Greene's lectures are interesting and applicable to life. I look forward to his lectures all the time.","Take this course. I never thought I'd take another psych course again after B-62 but this class was really enjoyable.","It is definitely useful and fun knowledge to have, but some of the concepts are intuitive.","Fascinating content. Amazing lecturer. Great assignments. You'll love it.","This course attempts to approach social psychology from a hard science perspective rather than a social science perspective. This can be good or bad, but even though I usually prefer liberal arts and such I loved it.","This class is awesome.","it's fun, easy, interesting","Speak to Greene outside of class. He's wonderful one-on-one.","Take this class. The material alone is absolutely fascinating, the lectures are very funny and overall an amazing experience","Professor Greene is an enthusiastic lecturer that will have your attention for most of the lecture. However, he does go a little too fast, which makes lecture videos really helpful. Make sure you start thinking about the project early, or you'll end up settling on a project that's not so interesting or a method that's not so appropriate. The exam was chill because if you studied, you could get a good grade on the exam.","Social psychology is one of the most interesting fields in the world, and Josh Greene does a fantastic job introducing you to that world.  His lectures are informative and funny, his exams are very fair and easy if you do the readings and pay attention to the lecture slides, and his work for the course is fairly light.  The final project takes up the most time, and I highly recommend figuring out your experimental idea early so that you can map out the remainder of the project and foresee shortcomings or potential failures.  Section was great and very chill, and this class was a phenomenal tier 2 class to take for psychology majors (and a great elective for everybody else!).","It's great, you can observe the psychological lessons of the class in everyday life!","If you want to gain a brief introduction to many different areas that social psychologists explore, this is the class for you.  This class will help you to realize the extensive degree to which psychological phenomena pervade everyday life.","This course was great and taught me a lot about scientific writing.","An interesting class with a lot of cool studies and good lectures. Be prepared to memorize a lot of different studies.","This is my favorite class I have taken at Harvard!  The lectures are interesting and entertaining, the readings are all very interesting and not too long, and discussion in section is always stimulating.  The project at the end of the semester is actually a lot of fun, and the tests aren't too hard.","This class is awesome! I had no psych background whatsoever and got so much out of this and really enjoyed it. Be prepared for a fair amount of memorization but this definitely beats taking a Core class to fulfill Sci B.","It is a great class that teaches the basics of social psychology.","Pretty easy if you actually do the readings and listen in lecture.","This will be one of the best courses you will ever take. Go for it!","It's fascinating, will teach you a lot of useful things that you should know in life. The professor is terrific, the class project is interesting. Overall, it's one of the best all around classes that I have taken at Harvard.","This is a great course. You learn a lot and are able to apply\/see what you learn in everyday life.","This class is a really fun, flexible, and not-to-demanding course. The lectures are fantastic - Prof. Greene is entertaining and hilarious. The exams are all fair as long as you study, and the section component of the class was actually worthwhile. The final project was also fun and engaging. This was a class where I would actually think of principles that I learned in class and apply them to everyday situations and my observations of social interactions.","Very fun and entertaining; you will learn a lot of cool and interesting information that pertains to your daily life and interaction with others.","This is a great class for anyone interested in becoming a psych concentrator. The project is a great way to introduce to students to psych research. Prof. Greene is a great, quirky lecturer. Definitely come to lectures since most of the test is based off of lecture.","Very fascinating subject matter - everyone should take this class if they have the free elective","Except for the final project there really isn't much work until just before the exams. The final exam was pretty tricky but in general the class was very interesting. I'm glad I took it and Greene is a boss. Carlo my TF is a chill dude. Too bad he's leaving to teach somewhere else next year....","Pretty good class. A lot of common sense stuff but some surprising things.","Interesting ideas, great lectures. But exams can be hit or miss.","If you're a senior searching for an elective, this is a great option. So fun! So interesting! Easy, too.","You don't have to be a psychology concentrator to really learn from and enjoy this course. The material is great, Prof. Greene is great (and funny), and the research project at the end of the course is a lot less intimidating (and more fun) than you think it will be.","Truly engaging and enthusiastic professor that makes the material fascinating and applicable to real-life situations. I truly enjoyed every single lecture of this course. Josh Greene is an incredible lecturer.","Greene is a great lecturer! He makes class really interesting and the material is pretty cool by itself. There isn't too much work but it is important to keep up with the readings.","If you are interested in humans and how they think, want to read about human behavior, and enjoy funny professors, take this class. The work load is very manageable, though the tests can be a bit challenging.  Don't be turned off by the project -- it's fun and not too hard.","Social psychology is a great class to take to knock out an SLS if you took AP Psych in high school.  It is not science-y at all and is really laid back.  The project and exams tend to be very fair and cut-and-dry (though the final was tougher than the midterms).  You can generally put in a solid two days of reading\/studying before the exams and be completely fine.","good, interesting class. not too demanding.","Make sure the read the chapters in the book because the exams incorporate material that is not presented in lecture but is discussed in the book.  Also, really enjoy the project.  It's actually pretty cool if you really try something innovative.","Amazing lectures and really engaging class. It's really a great psychology course.","don't fear the final project! its a great experience! the material is fascinating, often intuitive, and the exams are not difficult.","There is a lot of great material covered in this class, and it gives great insight into the workings of the human mind in society, which I think integrates well with many subjects. Some of the mechanics of the class aren't the best, but the material is excellent (especially if this is your first psychology class).","This is a very straightforward, interesting class.  Textbook readings and lectures.  Tests and assignments were very straightforward and fair.  Very reminiscent of a high school course.  If you're looking for a fun and easy elective or interested in psychology, I'd definitely recommend it.","Tests are not difficult, but you definitely need to study and memorize which makes it more like a high school class in some ways. A lot of the material is interesting, but some seem repetitive from intro psych or is uninteresting.","the class can be one of the more difficult classes if you are not willing to really study for the tests pretty intensely. lectures are online, the project can go at your own pace, but the tests can get you if you are not prepared beforehand","Great course with a humourous lecturer and a wide coverage of topics related to Social Psych. I recommend the course, although I ultimately decided that a concentration in Psych was not for me.","the course is deceptively easy. lectures are so so interesting but exams are very difficult and the final project is a lot of work too","This is a great course.  Greene is an entertaining lecturer and is definitely someone to take a class with.  None of the material is particularly hard, but be aware that the project at the end of the semester is not something you want to procrastinate on or you'll definitely pay for it later.","It's very interesting--I would definitely recommend it. Do not be shy if you do not have a psych background; the tests are fair and the TFs are helpful.","great course!!! very interesting and engaging!! but, need to memorize the studies done for exams!","This course is brilliant and Prof. Greene is hilarious. Probably the best lecturer and most entertaining professor at Harvard, at least in the Psych department!","Take this class! Professor Greene and the TF staff are both entertaining and good teachers. Also, the topic is about how people interact and why they behave in certain ways which in and of itself is very interesting.","Interesting and fun. Get the opportunity to learn all the basics about social psychology. And get the chance to do an unobtrusive study.","This was one of the best and most interesting classes I've taken at Harvard. Definitely take this if you're at all interested in social psychology!","Start the research project early.","This is a fun and interesting class! The project is pretty time-consuming, but the material is really interesting and lectures are great","Great for a pass\/fail class!","It's not very hard, it's interesting, and you'll learn a lot. Certainly not exactly the hardest of sciences, but if you're looking for a fun class where you'll get to work on a cool project and learn about some surprising phenomena, then you'll have a great time.","Psych 15 is such a fun and enriching class! The course material is interesting, lectures are engaging, and workload is very manageable.","This class is amazing, but make sure to pay very close attention during the lectures because they go by quickly! The material is very interesting so studying is actually kind of fun!","This is a fun course with a light workload. The information is very relevant to life and is interesting!","This class is well-taught and has very interesting material. However, it was a little difficult as someone who didn't take SLS20 and it was a little too science-y for me. To do well you need to commit a lot of time to studying both lecture and the textbook for the exams.","Great class. Prof. Green is very funny, and the material is easy and applicable. Good elective especially for non-concentrators. No psychological background necessary.","Just do the reading and go to lecture and you'll do very well, however, if you think some of psychology is illegitimate don't take this class because it covers pretty much all of those sorts of topics.","This class examines some very interesting and applicable materials, and you also get to do a non-obstrusive study. Professor Greene is a really entertaining lecturer, and my TF (Adrian) is probably one of the chillest and nicest TFs in existence. The textbook is very nice, the source books well chosen, and although you may be skeptical of some studies (especially you are a rather hardcore science concentrator like me), it is still very interesting. I took the class as an elective and hence expected it to be just fun, but it ended up helping me to understand a lot of real world phenomenon and human behaviors.","The course material is very interesting and is a great intro to social psych. Overall, the class was very large and the sections were definitely way over quota-- this takes away from student-TF interactions. Also, some TFs may have overlooked that this is is an intro psych course and graded as if students should know how to write in the psychology discipline.","This class will make you realize that life is basically a social psychology experiment. This was probably my favorite class this semester, not only because it covered interesting topics but also because Professor Greene is hilarious and a fantastic lecturer.","Amazing course. I took this as a senior year elective, and because of it, I realized my only regret here at Harvard - not taking a psych course earlier so I could've taken more. The material is so interesting, the professor is engaging, the TFs are funny and knowledgeable, and the course is so well organized.","Do not take this class pass-fail!!! It is way too easy. If you read the textbook (which is interesting), go to lecture (also interesting), and study for the exams (which are very fair and not tricky) it is not too hard to do well in this course. The project is fun and not too hard either. Overall it is a really interesting and not difficult class, ie a great elective!","The class is generally fun to take. The exams are a pain to study for (since in order to get a good grade, you need to study pretty hard), and the project takes a lot of time to do right. Other than that, it's a good course.","Definitely do the readings! But I would recommend doing them after the lectures about the readings, because there is some overlap and it makes the lectures less entertaining to know some of the stuff already.","This is very much like SLS20 - if you didn't like that - don't take this course!","This course is wonderful. It's super interesting and the lectures are amazing. The project\/readings can be a little tedious, but in general, it's definitely worth it.","great, great class! you will not regret taking it, there is so much to take away from it","Great class! Prof. Greene is an engaging lecturer, and the material is so interesting.  Be prepared to give some time to your project and to choose a topic that excites you.","I would tell them that the class is cool and interesting and not too hard, but that you must be interested in what they're teaching (aka Social Psych) or else you'll hate it.","Psy15 is a great course to take. Greene is a really good lecturer. It does get a little repetitive if you've taken other psych courses but it's an easy way to fulfill your tier 2 requirement.","I love Professor Greene! And I actually enjoy attending lecture. The research project is a little annoying, though. Start thinking of a project idea fairly early.","josh greene made this course","Take this class! Professor Greene is a great lecturer and section is useful and interesting.","Its a hard course and its a little unfair","This is a fairly easy, very interesting class.  Josh Greene is fantastic, and anyone interested in social science should take it.","its tough but interesting especially for philosphy\/social studies\/sociology folks","It provides interesting insight into how we as humans work and socialize. I enjoyed learning about so many of the subconscious processes and evolution and how we are influenced by others without even knowing\/realizing it. The material is very engaging!","This class is amazing- each lecture is just full of experiments that make you think \"oh THAT'S why that happens.\" It's a really great class, definitely take advantage of the interesting readings.","great course, great lecturer, not super great at preparing you for exams","Amazing class! Great lecturer, great material. Wonderful opportunity to learn about people and groups and why they are the way they are.","Definitely take this class! You'll never think about the world in the same way.","The course was difficult at exam time, but I did really enjoy the course overall as both the professor and the course material were interesting.","Stay on top of your readings and you will be fine","This class gives an interesting overview of social psych and is very engaging, though be prepared to learn a LOT of material for the exams!","TAKE IT.  I honestly enjoyed almost every moment of it.  The lectures are legitimately fun to watch, and I never felt like I was doing pointless work.  However, you do absolutely HAVE TO read the textbook to do well on exams.  Better to read after lecture than before.","The material is pretty easy but there's just a lot to cover, particularly for the final exam because it is cumulative","Amazingly useful. It's one of those classes that you actually want to go to the lecture (not because of clickers or attendance credits)","This class was really fun. Professor Greene is so engaging and has a great sense of humor; lectures were very interesting, and the exams were fair. My TF made sections very low-stress and funny. The project was a bit of a bother, but as long as you have a feasible study idea and don't procrastinate, it's a rewarding experience. Took this class for my concentration and very happy with the Psych department!","This is a fantastic and interesting class.  There are a lot of overlaps with SLS 20, but that's not really a reason not to take the class unless you want something completely new.","Its an interesting class but there is a lot of work.  If you don't stay on top of the readings, lectures, section project and study pool credit then you're in for a long semester","TAKE THIS CLASS. Joshua Greene is really funny, caters the lectures to college students. Also, the topics are things that you will be thinking about all day, because they are so applicable to real life. The course was fun, manageable, and made me think and learn about my friends, family and myself and why we act the way we do!"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Great class, not too much work. Take it whether or not you're going to do more in psychology. Professor Greene is fantastic.","greene is great","You need to read the textbook. You're tested on the information and you'll never see it in lecture.","This is a really great class. Prof. Greene, in addition to being a wonderful lecturer, is really invested in connecting with the students. Unlike some other professors, he does have office hours, and he's also good about responding to e-mails and is willing to have individual meetings with students. The TFs are also very accessible. Perhaps most important, though, is that the material in this class is very interesting. It's all applicable to the real world, and it really makes you look at social interaction more critically. I highly recommend this course.","Take this class! The textbook and lectures are so easy to read. Gives you a great understanding of human behavior.","The class is fascinating because the material is really accessible and relatable to our lives.","If you like psychology, the material is extremely interesting, and professor Greene isa great professor and a hilarious person.","It is a good class to take: interesting and offers insight into the minds of others (which is useful in whatever you choose to pursue)","Take this course. You will never look at yourself or anyone else quite the same way.","This class is fun! I took it as an elective, and other than the final project, it was very low-stress. The subject material is also really interesting!","Great class! You'll enjoy it. Be prepared for lots of reading, but it's all interesting. Project is fun and relatively painless. Exams are tricky but if you study you'll be fine.","This class is great and not only teaches a lot about social psychology, but also gives a TON of insight that you will find yourself applying to scenarios in your daily life. This class is a great follow-up to SLS20 as well because it gives a valuable complement to much of the research discussed in SLS20.","Keep up with the readings! Professor Greene is a great lecturer. Take this course; the material is very interesting.","This is a solid course. However, if you have already taken SLS20 I would probably recommend that you take one of the other foundational pscyh. courses because PSYCH. 15 and AP Pscyh or SLS20 are so similar as to be almost not worthwhile.","This class asks students to uncritically swallow and then regurgitate the central tenets and findings of an academic discipline whose epistemological foundations are questionable at best. The course's structure, which focuses on lectures which present information as if it were orthodoxy, readings which go essentially undiscussed, and a series of exams that encourage rote memorization more than any kind of higher-level intellectual engagement, is reminiscent of high school. The final project, where asinine research questions are given prizes, is the perfect training ground for the next generation of social psychologists: asking all the wrong questions, and never reflecting on why.","Do the textbook readings. It will save you a lot of trouble.","Professor Greene is a wonderful lecturer. He makes the hour and a half go by very quickly. The information learned is applicable to life and you get to watch 12 Angry Men at the end.","The material is extremely interesting and applicable to your own life.  Very worth the work required","Read the textbook! For all of my science classes at Harvard I have barely used the textbooks, but this class you really need to read the textbook thoroughly in order to do decently on the exams and final.","Only take this if social psych is your thing.  I was expecting the class to be more engaging and though I do feel I learned from the course I don't think it was worth a semester of taking it.","Be sure to read the book!  It really helps, and it is necessary to do well on the tests.  This class is awesome, and not too much work.  For students who have taken the psych tutorial and SLS 20, this class is interesting, but easy","I took this class to satisfy a UTEP requirement and to also satisfy my SLS Gen-Ed. For those who are more concept oriented than detail oriented this class may prove difficult because of the amount of detail it asks you to memorize and the way tests are constructed. As a UTEP requirement it may prove to be one of the most difficult especially if you lack a psych background. Make sure you pay attention to the readings and allow yourself time to memorize the terms.","this class is harder than you think, you need to make sure you have several hours a week outside of class to dedicate to reading and reviewing material.","Professor Greene is the man. And Jeff is awesome too. Take it!","I would not suggest taking this course as an elective if you have already taken SLS 20 with Gilbert. I would also choose SLS 20 with Gilbert over this course.","This class is so interesting, no matter what you wish to concentrate in, because what you learn can be applied to almost any field of study. It also applies very well to our daily lives because it helps us better understand the world in general.","If you're interested in the class take it.  If you have taken SLS 20 and have knowledge beforehand, you'll likely find it to be a waste of time.  A lot of overlap from SLS 20.","Very interesting. SLS 20 students, however, should be aware of the overlap.","Very interesting course. Tests are much easier than SLS 20 (more formulaic, easier to study for). The final project is fun and not really too difficult. If you liked SLS 20, take this and don't worry - it's not as stressful.","Take this class! Such interesting material. Make sure that you stay on top of the reading and go to lecture or at least watch all of the lecture videos. Make sure you pay attention to definitions and concepts. They are the key to this class. The project in the end is a bit annoying though.","Great course and interesting course matter -- just beware if you are not a psych concentrator or have not taken SLS20 yet. Easy if you've taken psych courses already, very difficult if it is your first.","This is a very light course - lectures are uploaded online, tests are very straightforward, sections only meet sporadically. It balances out heavy semesters nicely, or would make an excellent fifth course. Professor Greene is fantastic - he's very accessible, his lectures are entertaining, he puts a ton of thought into how he'll present the material, and it shows! The research project is a satisfying way to tie together many elements of the course. Besides, social psych is inherently interesting and easily applicable to everyday life. Take this course at some point!","Its a good class, with a good lecturer and great material. Very interesting. I never fell asleep in lecture. Before taking the class, consider if the project is the right thing for you. I struggled a lot with it, and the exams, and therefore, my perceptions of the course was not as good as most other peoples.","This is a fun and interesting course with a very good professor. The exams aren't very difficult and the research paper is much easier than it sounds, they walk you through every step of the way. Take this especially if you like Psychology","This is a really great, interesting class. Prof. Greene is the man. He's funny and usually ends class early. Though they say the exams test both readings and lecture, i'd say it's 80% readings and 20% lecture. But pay attention to the experiments he talks about in lecture.","Professor Greene is a fantastic lecturer! This class is not too challenging and really fascinating.","Pay lots of attention to the research experiments\/ results addressed in class and in the book. Do the readings every week and memorize the vocab. Other than that, you should do fine on the tests.","Take this class!  Professor Greene is AWESOME.  His lectures are always really interesting and fun.  Go to them.  He's better in person than he is on the computer screen you'll watch him on if you skip.","If you're looking for an interesting and not too difficult elective, you can't go wrong with Psych 15. Professor Greene is the man and the assignments are manageable.","Very interesting class but the tests are rather hard","This class makes you very well versed in the social psychological world, and you'll be able to recognize most major studies and names after the course. It you've taken SLS20 with Gilbert, there is A LOT of repeat. Probably 75% of what you see in social psych, you've at least heard of in Gilbert's class. So, if you're okay with repeat, then this class is great. The last portion of class gets into newer material. The research paper really isn't that bad either, and the sourcebooks are all fascinating. Overall, it's a good class. Take it if you want to see the world in a social psych light.","So, Josh Greene is no Dan Gilbert. Nevertheless, his lectures were pretty good, but there was no reason to go to class because lectures were online. The project component was educational. The course content is definitely interesting, so definitely take this course if you're at all interested in social psych.","This is a great class because the things learned are applicable to our lives, which help when studying for tests. The final project is fun, too!","I loved this class. By far my favorite in college. Material was very interesting.","This class is very fun, interesting, and entertaining! This is not the easiest class, but it isn't too rough and after completing it you will feel well-equipped to continue with harder Psych courses and even actual research in the field of Psychology.","This course covers material that is essentially identical to material from Gilbert's SLS20. I thought that it would be worthwhile to take the course anyway, and while it was definitely easier because of the similarities, I was also frequently bored.","The course material is really reasonable to grasp and the lectures are fun and interesting. If you've never taken a psych course before though (I hadn't), the exams are very specific and pretty tricky. Talk to someone who has taken the course before about how to prepare for the midterms\/ final.","This is a fairly fun course. It's a lot of material and exams can be tricky, so be prepared. Professor talks fast, which makes lecture hard to follow.","Engaging professor, interesting material","Great overview of social psychology, extremely organized. Nour is an extremely informed TF and Professor Greene has a great deal of knowledge and insight in how to ask the right questions for lab experiments.","I only recommend this class if you are concentrating in psychology. If you are just looking for a fun class to learn about the same material, take SLS20 with Gilbert. This course has a lot of material overlapping with that class, which isn't necessarily a problem, but the lectures are kind of boring and difficult to follow if you are not naturally interested in the material.","It's an interesting class but a lot of review from SLS 20. first half not that interesting for students who have taken sls 20 recently.","It is very interesting and not too much work.","SO FUN!","There's probably easier ways to fulfill SLS, but this is fairly painless and rather interesting.","Professor Greene is a great teacher. His lectures are witty and interesting. Although the research project at first seemed intimidating, it was actually really fun to do and is a great way to step your foot into the psych experiment world.","This class is interesting because it is relevant. It tries to explain our behaviors and interactions with others and most of it makes a lot of sense because we are already familiar with how things work.","This class offers a great chance to study some of the most intriguing psychology experiments and to do an experiment of your own! Overall really excellent, though it's difficult to stay awake in the afternoon lectures by the end of the semester, no matter how wonderful Joshua Greene is. For the exams, make sure to really study all of the key terms from both lectures and the book. Know them all, as you'll be tested over some of the more obscure ones. Be able to explain most of the experiments too (as in, what did the researchers measure in the experiments and how did they interpret these measurements?). The exams can be difficult, but fair on the whole.","Go to class. Makes it so much more worthwhile.","Greene is a great lecture.  The opportunity to perform a psychology study and apply the concepts learned in class is also an awesome experience.","For those looking to take this class an elective: If possible, take SLS 20 with Gilbert instead. Covers virtually all of the interesting material taught in this course, and is just awesome.","This is a fun class. Each lecture is basically just a series of interesting experiments. Professor Greene explains the design of each experiment and then the results. A lot of them are pretty interesting, with dependent variables such as whether the participant offers to help when a confederate falls off a ladder. There's also a research project required for the course, which can be fun because you get to apply what you've learned. The design has to be unobtrusive (just observing people in a setting you create, counting word types in published works, etc.), but a lot of people find ways to discover really interesting results. Whether you are interested in psych or just want to hear about some famous, creative experiments, you should take this class.","Fun Course! Greene is great and the material is very applicable to the \"real world.\"","The tests are fairly difficult but if you do all the reading and listen to lecture you will get a lot of out the class and do fairly well.","great class. you should take it. very interesting.","Don't take it unless you are self-motivated enough to teach yourself the material. Also, sections are utterly useless.","This is a really interesting class with great lectures. There's a lot of assignments (2 midterms, a final paper and a final) but the work itself isn't that hard. Definitely study the experiments, not just the terms.","If you've takin SLS 20, prepare for over half of the class to be review. Greene is a pretty good lecturer, but the repetition can get fairly boring at times. Exams are manageable as long as you look at the important terms in the book.","Take it! Extremely interesting and applicable to your life!","Pretty easy, low stress, fair grading. Interesting subject material.","This class is fun, has a light work load, exams are fair, and Dr. Greene is a clever and engaging speaker.","I think this was a really interesting course, but it can be difficult to actually do well. The tests are pretty straightforward, but there is a lot of material (especially terms) to memorize.","Requires a lot of work but the intellectual rewards are worth it.","It is a lot of work. Doing the research project takes  a ton of time and there is tons of material. That being said, the lectures are interesting and the so is the subject material.","The material is interesting","This class is one that I feel everyone at Harvard should take. Incredible teaching, amazing takeaways. I would just advise people to study for the tests seriously. There is a lot of material, and it can be overwhelming if you leave it all for the last minute.","TAKE THIS CLASS.","Take this course!  I never knew that learning about myself and others could be so interesting and fun.  Plus, Professor Greene is an amazing lecturer, probably just as good as Dan Gilbert.","A semi- hidden gem. I wish this course got more hype because it really is fun. The lectures are so fun and entertaining. I never listen to lectures while studying for a final but I found myself listening to the lectures as if they were podcasts. Professor Greene is so approachable and he wants people to visit him during office hours. Take the class. Come on. Just take it. You'll learn how to get people to do what you want. Maybe I'm doing it now to you. You won't know unless you take the class."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Professor Greene is one of the best lecturers I've ever had in six semesters at Harvard. This class is a rewarding, relatively stress-free way of fulfilling the SLS requirement, so what do you have to lose?","Exactly what you want from any class. Very interesting ideas presented well, a focus on the important themes rather than irrelevant facts, and a very manageable workload.","Social Psych is a good requirement course for psychology concentrators. The lectures are interesting, and Professor Greene is a good lecturer.","This is a great course with applicable and interesting material.","Project takes up a lot of time, but you will be very proud of the result of you put in the time. The tests were multiple choice and fairly tricky.","Professor Greene is amazing. He makes the class fun and there is never a dull moment. Also, it is very doable if you do the work fully. Take this course!","Enjoyable class. Not too difficult. All of the exams are fair. Definitely focus on the book readings and you should do fine on the exams. The project is fun and definitely doable, and the books you can choose from as inspiration for the project all seem interesting (I loved mine- The Secret Life of Pronouns by James Pennebaker). Interesting class for psych concentrators and would make a good SLS 20 gen ed as well (although I think I would have preferred SLS 20 if I was just trying to fulfill the gen ed requirement).","This class is great! The lectures are always interesting, and Professor Greene is really funny. Some of the material is a bit repetitive of SLS20, but you're just learning awesome stuff again. At the end, you get to conduct your own unobtrusive study, which is a great learning experience. Definitely recommended!","This course is fun, and very applicable to everyday life. If you've taken Gilbert's SLS20, you will be pleasantly surprised by how relatively painless the tests are. Greene is a great lecturer, and the only real downside to this course is that sections weren't too helpful (more due to the way they were organized rather than to the quality of the TFs, who were great)","Definitely take this class if you want to learn about your everyday life interactions with other people. Very informative class.","Take it! Easy and interesting, great guidance from my TF","It is very interesting, but dont let yourself fall behind on textbook readings.  Also, all the tests focus on the studies presented in class and in the book, so make sure to pay attnetion to them","Professor Greene is a great lecturer. He mainly teaches through various psych studies and experiments to explain a social psychology phenomena. It is amazing how he condenses complex psych experiments to a very simple explanation that a 5 year old could understand. He is a very smart man, and you should all learn from him. Although I took SLS20, I felt that I learned so much more than I did in SLS20. In fact, I would skip SLS20 all together and take this class instead. (I wish I did that!)","This class is great. The lectures were awesome, and the project was a lot of fun!","Take it.","This class was really fun and interesting. However just keep in mind that there is a lot of overlap between this class and SLS 20. Otherwise, all of the lectures are great, Prof. Greene is fun, and you'll have fun!","Take Social Psych! Greene is awesome, and the studies are so cool - you'll have so much fun going to class. Make sure to read the textbook though or you won't do well on exams","The professor (Greene) is great and the class is entertaining.","Do the readings when they're assigned, not just before the tests. Also start working on your experiment as soon as possible.","Take this class! Best SLS gen ed ever. Not super easy but great, useful material.","Sections are utterly useless. Do the readings! I am not one that normal does readings, but most of the ideas that come out of lectures can be really well enforced through the readings. Also, pay attention in lecture. Josh is entertaining, so don't just zone him out and go on Facebook. It's all directly applicable to the exams. Also, the essay on the final was about the movie we watched.","This class is really great. The readings and lectures complement each other well, and the work load is definitely manageable. The exams were pretty straightforward and fair. Also, the sections are very laid back and intended to help with projects and not waste time, which is definitely appreciated. Joshua Greene is a fantastic lecturer and will keep you engaged.","DO THE READING. SERIOUSLY. The tests are deeply related to it, and you will not get a great grade otherwise. Also, set deadlines for yourself in regards to the final project. Getting it done the night before does not work well, actually.","This class is wonderful and very interesting but a little harder than one might expect. Make sure you are also reading the text book and going to office hours and it should be all good!","One of the most incredible courses I've taken at Harvard.  The content is so cool because it brings you inside the psychology of how you think, why you do the things that you do, why others do, and how that affects your interactions with others.  So relatable to my everyday life, brought me to thinking about a lot of people and how I interact with them.","Great class. Well taught. Fairly graded. Decent amount of work but nothing too overwhelming.","good class. If you're good at memorization, you'll find it easy. very interesting subject matter though.","This class is really great--you learn so many social psych phenonmena and terms and you just feel so smart. It's one of those classes where, if you put in the work, you WILL see the results. There are no tricks, and no surprises. As long as you maintain a good relationship with your TF, aren't afraid of reading full chapters in a textbook, and go to lecture, then you will be GUCCI!","It's easy if you go to lectures and pay attention. It SEEMS like SLS20 with Gilbert, but with two important differences: There is even more content from the textbook (because there's not as much overlap), and the exams are MUCH easier. They are still multiple choice, but they really mean it when they say it's not that bad. I took the class pass-fail and instantly regretted it after the first exam. The median was much higher than I expected, and later they even boosted up peoples' scores because they were lower than usual.","If you liked SLS 20, this class will be enjoyable. The tests are not super easy though so be sure to study. Also, get your TF to like you or your grades on your project and section will be hellacious.","Awesome choice of course. Provides you with surprisingly practical knowledge which is, of course, super interesting.","This is a great course!","this class is awesome. if you like psych you should take it. professor Greene does a great job of presenting interesting\/new\/relevant material and even though i'd seen some of it before it was still presented in an interesting\/new way. the project seems hard but it's not because they have broken it down into logical parts and help you along the way.","An interesting class, particularly if you're interested in the philosophical aspects of psychology. There is a lot of overlap with SLS 20, especially if you took it with Gilbert. Also, if you find the philosophical aspects somewhat inane, as I did, you won't miss out on a lot by taking a different foundational course.","Professor Greene is a great lecturer. Additionally, he and the teaching staff are all funny, helpful, and easy to approach. The course is a great way to get a new perspective on social interactions.","I absolutely loved it.","This course is extremely fascinating. If you took SLS 20 with Gilbert, there will be some overlap, but not enough to deter you from taking it if you're interested in social psychology. The workload is quite light, and the exams are fair. Greene himself is quite funny and brings an interesting philosophical perspective to psychology. This course convinced me that I should concentrate in psychology.","Wow, what to say? You must take this course before you graduate from Harvard. Social psychology teaches you so much about how people work that it would be a crime for you to miss out on it. Prof. Greene is incredibly intelligent and is an excellent lecturer. I had taken SLS 20 and was a bit apprehensive about overlap. Yes, there was some overlap, but I felt I was coming away from the course with a ton of new material, and the old material I held with a greater depth of understanding. My goodness, you have to take this class!","Takes time but I learned a lot of interesting things.","Professor Greene is a great lecturer, which keeps the class interesting, but be forewarned that most of the class is discussing psychological study after study with very little discussion.","A fascinating course whose subject matter deals with human behavior and phenomenon that we observe in our everyday lives. Also, professor Greene is a great lecturer and makes the material very interesting.","Very good, fun class. Project was very fun, and I learned a lot. Lots of overlap with SLS 20, though.","I took this class because I'd heard that Psych 15 is easier (in terms of exams) than SLS20, I needed to fulfill a gen-ed, and Psych 15 also fulfills a sociology concentration requirement. I did not take SLS20 prior to Psych 15. I am very glad I took this class because I learned that I love social psychology. I find it fascinating, and I think about it all the time now. This class is extremely easy. I watched lecture videos at home at double the speed using the CS50 2x chrome extension. I studied for the exams using the online book resource: wwnorton.com\/college\/psych\/social-psych3. This site is excellent because it has flashcards of all the vocab words, chapter summaries, and quizzes for each chapter. It's an excellent way to study for the exam. You can also buy the ebook for half the price of the actual book through the site. Definitely take this class! It's easy, it fulfills a multiple requirements, lectures are online, you have plenty of online resources to help you prepare for exams, the final paper is painless, and you learn a ton about your own psyche!","it's easy to start slacking off, but the exams and project will bite you if you don't get your stuff together.","This a fantastic class with fascinating material and a hilarious lecturer. Don't let the stammering on your first day of shopping stop you from coming back, Prof. Greene's lectures are so engaging and entertaining that you will stop noticing it by the end of the week. You won't want to miss a lecture. Great class for psych concentrators, people looking to fulfill the SLS gen ed, athletes or people with busy schedules who need a flexible class with self time management, and anyone interested in learning more about the social world and our interactions with other human beings. Take this class!","This is a super fascinating course that teaches you a lot about the way people interact in social contexts. Don't worry if you aren't particularly interested in psychology or neuroscience; as long as you enjoy learning more about people and the way they think and behave, you should take this class. The exams are pretty fair once you get the hang of them. You have to submit a final research paper about a social psych study that you design and conduct, but you're given a lot of guidance and instruction throughout the semester on how you should go about doing that. Be sure to attend lectures (a lot of the information shows up on exams) and do the readings if you want to do well in the course!","The tests are deceivingly difficult.","Attend the lecture, read the book, there are easy multiple choice questions on the exam.  Greene's a good professor and lecturer.","This course does really expect you to read the textbook as well.","This class is great! It has real life applications and is always really interesting. If you have the space in your schedule and the time to dedicate to preparing for the exams, take this course!","you learn so much about everyday interactions.","Very interesting class.  Even if your not a Psy concentrator the material is very applicable to life in general.  Not a lot of work if you go to lecture and read the textbook. Greene is a good lecturer and as a result lecture is actually enjoyable.","Make sure you read the textbook and go over all the experiments he went over in lecture. Know the procedure and results for the experiments. Tests are really straightforward if you do these two things.","Great course to take, even if you are not a psych concentrator or even interested in psych, there's so much interesting, useful information in the course and it is not terribly difficult. Good way to fulfill gen ed!","This is an excellent way to take care of the SLS gened, just make sure you'll have time before both the midterms and the exam to properly study--there is more material than you think! Do your best to keep up with the textbook reading, though no one ever does. It's definitely possible to cram for the exams starting a few days before, but it's less than pleasant. Come up with an interesting topic for your final project and make sure you talk to your TF if you're not a Psych concentrator or if this is your first psychology class. Professor Greene is an excellent lecturer and is super funny and interesting, but it's possible to never to go lecture either since they're all taped. BE CAREFUL with this easy option, though, since that will mean you'll be playing catch-up before the midterms. Overall this course is a great introduction to psychology with some genuinely interesting topics the standard midterms, final project, and final.","Do the readings! I learn that the hard way, and also, really try to have fun with your projects because the more work you put into it definitely yields better result","If everyone was required to take this class, the world would be a much better place. This class has changed the way I view the world and especially people around me. I understand now that there is so much we don't know about our minds and the reasons we do things, and it's made me think more about my behaviors and attitudes and those of people around me. I would recommend you take this class since it is not difficult but has huge rewards. Read the textbook and just deal with the exams (questions can be slightly tricky but if you read the book you will do just fine).","Warning: taking this class will make you overanalyze all of your social interactions ever. In spite of that (or perhaps because of it) this is a fabulous course: social psychology is definitely worth delving into, and Professor Greene provides an engaging and comprehensive introduction. The focus is on individual experiments, but for the most part they are well-connected to the theory. Start thinking about your project early and take it seriously; it's a great creative opportunity and will give you a much better appreciation for social science (experimental design is hard!)","Take it! Super interesting and fun.","Sweet class","If you are interested in psychology at all take this course! The information is fascinating and applies to every aspect of life. The work load is reasonable and the final project is very flexible.","Make sure to do all readings and the lectures. You cannot just choose one to study.","This class with present a new way of looking at the world, only take this course if you are prepared to deeply analyze your own social life as well as the social life around you. You will not look at things the same way.","This class is a painless general education course. The tests can be a little tricky, but as long as you attend or watch lectures and read the textbook, you will do great.","Make sure to read the required readings before exams, and focus on every experiment it discusses. Be ready to be tested on the reading material.","If you do the readings, you should do well in the class.  The experiment part of the class can be a lot of fun if you spend some time on it.","I looked forward to coming to lectures because they were always so interesting.  The range of topics was great, and Greene is a very effective lecturer  A major highlight of the course was the very minimal amount of work, especially compared to hard science courses.  Exams were easy and other than the study portion, virtually no homework.  The study, although not universally popular, was a cool experience in my opinion and gave me a better understanding of the experimental process.","Both section and lecture are revealing in fantastic ways. The project, while time consuming, is very rewarding and great practice for further research you may want to do. I recommend this class even if you are not concentrating in PSY because it is so applicable to real life.","Great class. If you found SLS 20 interesting and want to learn more about introductory social psych, take it, although this class doesn't assume any prior knowledge. Prof. Greene is brilliant, funny, charismatic, impressive, and obviously invested in the material.","Excellent overview to social psychology. You will learn a lot and every lecture and topic will be fascinating.  The big question is whether or not you could just as effectively learn this on your own.","This is a very fun and interesting course.  The lectures are super interesting.  However, be sure to pay a lot of attention to the book, because lots of that shows up on tests that isn't covered in section or lecture.","Very interesting material that is relevant","You learn a lot, the material is very applicable, and it's not unnecessarily difficult. It's very straightforward, the lectures are engaging, and it's a very enjoyable class.","Know some basic statistics, or have friends that can help you with it. Read the books, don't rely on the lectures (treat the lecture slides like supplements to the text book).","It's a GREAT psych class, my only \"problem\" with the course is the speed at which prof. greene runs through the material","Extremely interesting, do the readings. Not life-changing, for me, but a great way to fill SLS nonetheless.","If you're looking for an SLS, I wouldn't suggest this course","This course is really interesting! Yes, there is a good amount of overlap with SLS20 and AP psych, but I took both SLS20 and AP psych, and I still felt like I gained a lot of valuable and interesting new information. Don't expect to get a good grade if you don't read the textbook\/don't really go to lecture--the exams will test you on minute details from specific studies. If you've taken SLS20 with Gilbert--the exams in this class seem easier, but there is WAY less of a curve, so don't get complacent(I made that mistake).","Greene is a great lecturer and the information is very interesting and applicable to real life. The tests are not too bad and the project is also a lot of fun and not difficult. There is some overlap between this class and SLS 20 but I would still recommend this class for psych and sociology concentrators.","Not a bad class. Just has a good amount of work and the exams are a bit difficult.","Good class overall. I took it for concentration credit, but it would be worth taking as an elective. Pretty light workload, exams are pretty easy, lectures are excellent, the material is excellent and very applicable to real life. The textbook isn't great but it's easy to read and there isn't too much reading.","Social psychology seems like a fun and easy psychology class but it's more difficult than you think.","It's awesome - this course really unifies the ethical and practical importance of studying social psychology,  Professor Greene presents countless studies and their design within these intriguing themes.  Definitely should be taken.","I liked it more than SLS20, lectures were great and I found the material more interesting","The lectures and sections were helpful, interesting, and enjoyable. The staff members were also very available and responsive, and all in all supportive and cool. I have few complaints with this course, as it wasn't killer in terms of workload and I definitely learned a solid amount of useful, interesting information. However, the assessments need to change. Making them all multiple choice (though the final fortunately did not follow this model 100%) makes the assessment reflect memorization more than internalization of the ideas in the class. For example, I counted, on one exam of (I think) 50 questions, about 22 questions that relied simply on whether you memorized which scientists' names were associated with which study, and what those specific results were. I know plenty about all of the ideas in the course, but ask me which scientists' studies were associated with these, and I'm useless to you, unless I spend hours upon hours studying - but in this case, I don't think that's nearly justified.","Only take if you are a concentrator.","This course was extremely interesting, and a great psychology course for both concentrators and non-concentrators.  The exams are trickier than I anticipated and require a lot of studying and understanding.  Otherwise, the course is manageable and definitely worth taking.","A great course. You learn so much, and all of the material is very applicable to the real world. Tests are hard and require a lot of prep, but it's worth it. Take this course!","do the readings. go over your notes. watch the lectures over again. Take lots of notes in class. Take advantage of section. ask your tfs for any help!","Lectures are great, the multiple choice exam format can be challenging","The class is extremely interesting and is a pretty easy way to fulfill a tier 2 class","The lectures and readings for this class are very interesting. In addition, you get the opportunity to design and execute an unobtrusive research project. If you have any interest in social psychology, I highly recommend this course.","Be ready to memorise plenty of studies for the midterms, and definitely do the readings and attend lecture. But otherwise, it'l a pretty chill class.","Great class.  Very enjoyable","The lectures are fascinating and Professor Greene is an entertaining, animated lecturer. DO NOT go into SLS 20 instead of PSY 15 if you have a choice between the two; this course is so much better, especially if you have any experience from AP Psychology. Try to get into Regan's section if you can; we had excellent discussions, and I really enjoyed the time we spent in that setting.","Interesting course, exams were somewhat difficult but fair and the project was a lot of work but worth it in the end. Lecture videos were a savior, and Professor Greene presents the material well","This class did not live up to my expectations at all. I had a fantastic, interactive (and admittedly small) high school AP Psych course, so I was looking forward to a similarly exciting course this semester. I was sorely disappointed. This class provides little to no opportunity to engage in the material. (The section component might have been intended to do this, but was unsuccessful.) While Josh's lectures are enjoyable to some extent (he has an excellent sense of humor and is good at explaining concepts) they are nonetheless largely overviews about the topics. The class attempts to cover far too many aspects of psychology and as a result is able to do justice to few of them. I've heard from psych majors that this class is not an accurate representation of the concentration, but it has nonetheless been a contributing factor in my decision to not major in psych.","READ, and read carefully.  Also, take detailed notes in lecture and if time, rewatch before exams.  Anything and everything can potentially be tested (even the in-class movies).","This class is a wonderful opportunity to explore many interesting areas of psychology. It will enhance the experience of any of those looking to concentrate, or offer a unique, fun experience to those just looking to meet a requirement or find an elective.","take this class, whether you're interested in psych or you just want the SLS requirement. it's pretty easy, the lectures are incredibly interesting. the only hard part of the class is the ten-page paper on your own independent research study.","The project isn't as bad as it sounds, and the midterms are pretty straight forward.","A spectacular course that I would recommend to anyone. One of the best classes I've taken in eight semesters at Harvard.","This class was by far the best class I've taken so far here. It was always super interesting, and full of \"aha\" moments when everything just suddenly came together. Highly relevant to everyday life, fair tests, and very manageable workload. Would recommend with enthusiasm!","This is not as easy as everyone says it is, or as interesting. It's a lot of work, a lot of reading, pretty intense tests (memorization-wise), and a lot of repetition of SLS 20. Professor Greene is awesome but the class is not a good use of your time if you've taken SLS 20.","It is a very interesting course! There is quite a bit of overlap from SLS20, but it is worth taking if you'd like to learn about social psychological phenomena in more depth."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["fun, interesting, and easy!","Psych 15 is a great course. I did not take SLS 20, and I did take AP Psychology, but it was poorly taught in my high school and it was many years ago. However, this course does not really need any prior background or experience. I really enjoyed this class because I felt it was very applicable to everyday life, and the concepts and studies were generally interesting to me. With that said, I really like Psychology in general, so my experience may not reflect the general view. Lectures can be a bit long at times (1.5 hours), but they are typically interesting. There are 2 midterms which are fair for the most part, but some of the questions at times may seem a little unfair\/confusing. Reading the textbook is pretty essential, in my opinion, but in order to do really well on the exams, you have to review the lectures and memorize the details. Also, the chapters are really long, so make sure you manage your time well to get through them all. It took me hours just to get through a chapter. One of the big aspects of this class is the research project (unobtrusive study) which is worth a substantial part of your grade (30%). It can be really fun, but it is a big project nevertheless and therefore can get burdensome. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to start early and talk to your TF about your project. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this course, especially if you are considering majoring or minoring in Psychology.","This is an interesting class, with materials that are relevant to everyday life. The lectures are fantastic, and my TF Regan is so helpful and insightful. Do prepare to do a lot of reading memorizing, especially before the tests. This part of memorizing is where I hated the most.","Super interesting, awesome class. Professor Greene is an amazing lecturer and this is an awesome follow up to SLS 20. One of my favorite classes at Harvard so far.","Lectures are often really interesting and entertaining, but subject matter can seem a bit basic if you've already taken intro psych. The final project could be really fun but not much instruction is provided for it so you may feel lost.","This is a perfect SLS fulfiller for humanities concentrators in particular. I was very concerned about taking anything even vaguely scientific, but my fears were not warranted! Professor Greene is hilarious, and gives lectures that are both engaging and easy to follow. Good variety of types of coursework. Good textbook. Exams graded very fairly. One of the more easily applicable-to-life courses at Harvard-- never a bad thing to know a little more about how the social world works!","its awesome!!!!! just take it!!!!","It is much easier than SLS, so do not be afraid. It is very interesting!","You really learn about life in this class-how you should debate your friends in an argument, how you behave socially.  It really didn't feel like a class in which you cram material for a test and then forget about it, but one in which big picture themes stand out to you and really make you think differently.  This is the beauty of a gen-ed system.","Prof. Greene is quite engaging and the material is fascinating! If you'd like the opportunity to make your own study and learn a thing or two about how the mind works within a social context, then this is the course for you!","This is a great course to fulfill the SLS gen ed. I had only a general interest in psychology and didn't take SLS 20, so this course was perfect. Lectures are mostly just running through tons of case examples but you don't really need to take notes as all the slides end up online eventually. Definitely study as many of them as you can for exams, however. You'll need to know them! Section was great and usually interesting. The final project is a cool opportunity to really be creative and conduct your own resarch. Highly recommend this course!","Very engaging class. Not a lot of work load if you keep up with the chapter readings.","This is a really interesting class. Professor Greene is awesome, though he talks really fast during lectures. The exams are fair, if you do the text book reading and attend lecture. Overall, it's not too difficult.","If you want to do really well in this class, it is do-able but it is a lot of work.","The tests are hard. Read the book.","The course is interesting, but the exams are difficult\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou really need to have memorized both the lectures and the textbook. I loved taking this course, but I wish I had taken it pass\/fail. I probably would have gotten the same thing out of it, without the unnecessary stress of exams.","PSY15 is a fantastic way to fulfill the SLS Gen Ed requirement - it's interesting material taught in great lectures, and from what I've heard about SLS20, much less stressful for your GPA. I highly recommend this course!","DO YOUR READING\r\nGO TO CLASS","If you're someone who hasn't taken SLS20 or any other science course, beware, because there will definitely be more work than you expect. If you are a psych concentrator or taken SLS20, then definitely take this course.","Be prepared to learn specifics. Take careful notes!","Take the course. Definitely take it over SLS20. I have some reservations about it just because I sometimes felt that lectures and exams didn't match up, but overall it's a fun course. You can totally get by with only reading the book, though, if you wanted to. The project is fun if you have a good TF (which I did), so that's a plus. It's a good course--won't change your life, won't make you re-think your major. It's fine-to-good, but not great.","Professor Greene is one of the best lecturers I have had at Harvard. He is active in the field (as you will learn when you get into moral psychology) and brings many relevant and contemporary studies into lecture. The class is generally a survey of all of the research, past and present, in the field of social psychology. As long as you read the book, preferably according to schedule since many of the readings are long, you will be fine for the tests. The project is pretty fun, especially because you have quite a bit of freedom to explore an idea you care about. Section in this course is lackluster mostly due to the large class sizes, but this should improve in later semesters.","This class requires a lot of work, but it was really interesting","This is a well taught class, but it might be a bit repetitive if you've taken SLS 20.  Make sure to study well for the exams, they can be harder than they seem.","This is a pretty interesting class.  If you go to lecture and do all of the readings, everything should come to you pretty easily.","Many people say that it's mostly the same stuff as SLS20. I disagree; while you do touch on similar principles, there's a lot of new content and there's a fresh perspective. Definitely worth taking whether you're into Psych or not","If you want a fun and easy was to complete the SLS requirement or just want to take a psych course, take this class.  It was interesting without requiring too much work or attention during lecture","I enjoyed this class because it was able to provide a more in-depth view of social psychology. It was interesting and informative.","This class is so wonderful. Don't take it if you want an easy elective, take it if you want to open yourself up to learning some curious, strange, and often troubling truths about humans in social situations. It will show you how we are not 100% free agents as we like to believe; rather, we're constantly influenced by subtle environmental and social cues that subconsciously affect our decisions, emotions, and behavior. Fascinating stuff!! (Also, you will fall in love with Joshua Greene.) Be forewarned: tests are fair but surprisingly hard to do well on, because there is no curve.","Tests are difficult, interesting material.","This course is amazing. Professor Greene is an enthusiastic and engaging lecturer and it is worth taking the course just to see how good courses should be taught. Before taking the course I was a little skeptical of the material (I was scared much of it would be a little obvious), but I was pleasantly surprised to how many counter-intuitive interesting facts\/trends I learned about human behavior. I highly recommend the class.","it is an interesting class but the assignments were very time consuming","It's a good course but don't take it as a GenEd, it's way too much work for that.","This class is a lot of fun, but be prepared to spend a good bit of time prepping for the exams.","This is a fascinating class. You will learn a huge amount from the engaging and funny lectures of Josh Greene. If there's one thing to watch out for, it's a relatively unprepared section environment that doesn't add a lot. But the ability to connect social psychology concepts we all see everyday to dramatic representations in movies like 12 Angry Men is worth it all by itself!","social psych is really interesting and the topics range from relationships to global social issues. Prof. Greene is an amazing and passionate lecturer so definitely take it for the lectures and not the assignments.","Very hard tests, do all the reading! very interesting material and I've definitely changed my views on life after taking this class","do not take unless required. if required, chose another course.","Not as easy as everyone says it is. You need good lecture notes and you actually have to read the textbook to do well on the exams. You will have to put in lots of hours of studying before the midterms, and even then the questions you are asked might be concepts that were barely covered in lecture.","Not a course you want to miss. It's unreasonably applicable to the interactions you see every day. And it clears up lots of common misconceptions in the process.","Take it! Great course that isn't too difficult, but teaches you tons of cool stuff that's applicable to the real world.","This class is great!  The research project allows for creative and independent thinking in a way that not many intro classes do.  My advice: think about an unobtrusive study (archival, observational, etc.) that you're interested in EARLY.  Professor Greene is a true star.","If you've taken SLS20, this course is extremely similar.  So unless you're REALLY interested in Psych, I would hesitate to take both classes.","This course was really interesting and a great way to fulfill the SLS gen ed. I think it provides more real life applicable information than SLS 20.  Everything we learned was pretty cool and though the final project is a little annoying, it wasn't too hard or time consuming.  The midterms and finals are a very specific and a bit difficult so do require several hours of studying.","Great way to learn about how to best relate to people. You do not need to have taken SLS20, in my opinion. I took it and found the first third of the material to be a repeat.","Depends on your TF if section is worth while.  Also some grade the final project harder than others. Multiple choice tests that can be tricky.","It's a good class and the content is very interesting, however the assignments are not helpful to your learning and obnoxious.","Section is pointless. Worthwhile if you need SLS, just pay attention in lecture and try to engage with it like a series of TED talks. Lots of nice bits to learn.","A class well worth taking. Social psychology with Josh Greene should be a requirement at this school. It is one of the most applicable classes at Harvard and teaches knowledge that every person should walk around with in their daily lives.","A pretty easy class, but very useful in everyday life! Everyone should take a social psychology class sometime in his life, so why not now? Josh Greene is a great and engaging lecturer, and the research project can be very rewarding.","If you you are interested in learning about people, this is a wonderful introduction.","The final project is super fun. This is a way more interesting SLS class than SLS20.","this is a great course. Really interesting lectures with Professor Greene and the project is not too much work but a lot of fun.","professor greene is a great lecturer - lectures were informative and entertaining; midterms were very straightforward (just pay attention during lecture, skim the readings); section is the only annoying part. this is a very painless class, and i felt like i learned a lot! this is a great intro course for freshmen and an easy senior spring course","This is an awesome intro to psych class. You learn a lot without really knowing it until you start to notice the stuff we talk about in the real world","Josh Greene is an amazing lecturer. Really fun class!","Take this course\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhether you're a psych major, just curious, or not curious in the slightest. This course has loads of fascinating studies that shows how people act and why they do so.","If you're doing this for SLS Gen Ed credit, take a different (smaller) course.","This course is a lot of fun to take. The concepts are super interesting and Professor Greene does a really good job of teaching them to you. It's fairly an easy, and if you put in the work need into it, you'll perform very well in the course.","great course, the only work required was the day before the exam, and a couple of days to write the final paper which was fun. the material was super interesting, and prof greene is a great lecturer. overall a fantastic course, and a great way to meet SLS while actually learning some really awesome stuff.","The material is wonderful and really makes you think.  The exams do focus heavily on specific experimenters and experiments, so focus on those heavily.   The guidance around the final paper was a bit strange, but it ends up being at least an interesting correlational study for a lot of people.  Overall, I'd absolutely recommend it, but study hard for the tests.","Greene is a good lecturer, and I feel like the material would be interesting to a wide variety of people. \r\n\r\nThe main downside to me was that the assessments were based on rote memorization.","This class blew me away and made me appreciate how many unseen factors influence our behavior. I did not fulfil the SLS20 pre-requisite but it wasn't too big of an issue according to Prof. Greene. Just remember that they make the exams tricky.","Great class! Lots of interesting information in every lecture\/reading, and section and assignments are extremely manageable.","Social psych is awesome! Don't be intimidated by SLS 20. The tests are much easier-- they're actually fair and not mind games like gilbert's exams. Also, Joshua Greene's lectures are really fun. He's a really nice guy and makes the lectures funny (similar to Dan Gilbert). Also, the research project does take time, but you can pick a fun question and end up enjoying it. I HIGHLY recommend this class!!","Very good class. Professor Greene is very entertaining, as is most of the material covered in this course. The exams are very fair (compared to SLS20) and the project, although menacing early in the semester, was actually fun.","Make sure you do the reading regularly. Just know all the studies mentioned in lecture and readings as most questions on exams are from those. Also choose an interesting final project and be in Regan's section. She is awesome!","This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard! Professor Greene is great and I learned a lot. That said, you do need to study for the exams. They are rather picky and require quite a bit of preparation. Take the course!","Not much work at all. Kind of unsatisfying - seems like a list of \"fun facts\" rather than a rigorous exploration of social psychology. Exams are easy (mostly multiple choice). Section is mind-numbingly boring. If you have a cool ideal that you're really invested in the project can be great, otherwise it's pretty dumb. Lectures are enjoyable, though.","It is a good course that isn't too hard that teaches you a lot","You need to keep up with the readings and don't get too far behind.","There is a lot of crossover with SLS20 as expected, I was warned by the Q guide but decided to take it anyways. Made the course less daunting but the material overall is easy to grasp.","Josh Greene is great.","The course is absolutely fabulous and informative. It helped me understand and critique how and why people do the things they do. It is an intriguing course that offers insight and the teaching staff is phenomenal. I loved it! 100\/10 on the perfect course scale.","Great class, super interesting, lots of overlap with SLS20. It was a perfect pass\/fail class (not a lot of work, straight forward exams, interesting final project)","TAKE THIS CLASS even if it's not a requirement. Greene's lectures are all hilarious, fascinating, and engaging and the material is so interesting that the readings and the work doesn't feel like too bad of a load. The project is EXTREMELY manageable and that's what the sections are dedicated to. If you want to take a class that you'll be able to use beyond the end of the course, this is it. Relevant, super interesting, a great, great use of time","This course will require very little work of you and it will provide you with very interesting information about human behavior. It is hard to complain about that deal. Still you have to be genuinely interested in social psychology to enjoy this class. Taking it with Professor Greene is an excellent opportunity; he provides nuanced views on much of the lecture material and manages to make many abstract concepts practical and relevant to daily life.","Most people who casually find an interest in Psychology really just like Social Psychology. This class is great, and Prof. Greene is a very entertaining lecturer.","Pay attention in lecture. They are interesting and will make the final project and exams much easier.","Keep up with readings! The tests are not difficult if you don't cram the night before.","The topics are very enjoyable. You will have a lot of fun listening to lectures and learning about interesting social psychology phenomena that will surprise you.","it is easy and entertaining. the material is really interesting as well! I was never stressed with this class. if you pay attention to the lectures and take good notes, the book is a good supplement but not crucial to the exam.","Every undergraduate at Harvard should take this course. It is not only amazing, taught by an incredible professor at the top of his field, but most importantly, will leave you a better person. You will understand why people may make the decisions and have the beliefs and attitudes they do, and through this understanding be more considerate of others. Josh Greene is the man, by the way.","It was a very enjoyable class. The prof was a good lecturer and the material was interesting. The tests\/ grades were very fair. Take it!","This was the first psychology class I have ever taken and I loved it!  I never felt behind or unprepared.  This is definitely the best way to fulfill your SLS gen ed.  The tests were very straightforward (unlike what I've heard about sls20), the lectures were amazing and so relevant to life, Josh Greene is awesome.  Take social psych!!","I would tell future students that this class is very well run, with great faculty and lectures. It's not an \"easy\" class, but you can do well without too much unnecessary stress.","Definitely take this class, especially to fulfill SLS","You learn a lot of fun facts.","This class is really interesting and pretty painless. Professor Greene is a really great lecturer and you'll find yourself identifying the topics you discuss in lecture in your day to day life. Great class!","This class has interesting material and engaging lectures overall. Do the reading before class. The exams tend to focus a bit more on lecture material but there are questions from the book too and literally anything can be tested. Make sure you start early on the final project and follow the guidelines closely.","This is a great course! However,  when they say study everything they mean study everything. I thought the course was great but it is not as easy it seems. Take this course seriously.","Great, fun class. Take the course with Professor Greene.","This class is extremely interesting, fun, and I am able to apply the things I learnt in class in my every day life which has been very rewarding.","Take this class! It's extremely interesting, it has a light workload, and the teaching staff is excellent.","An absolutely fascinating course that deals with a lot of relevant concepts. It's beyond a psychology course, it gives a key background to understanding many of today's sociological and political problems. The workload is absolutely manageable and the exams are fair.","Fantastic course. Riveting lectures, interesting readings, engaging lectures, fun sections, and a real-world experiment as a final project! Absolutely fantastic. Would definitely take again, and again, and again.","take this class! it will open your eyes to the world around you","This class is OK. Definitely not as entertaining as SLS 20, but still worthwhile. The exams are definitely easier and less tricky than SLS 20, but still kind of detailed and not something you want to slack on. The best part of this class is definitely the final project where you get to conduct your own experiment.","I would say that the class is decently interesting, but the research project is irritating to get done if you have a busy schedule and do not have a stats background.","This is a GREAT course. The exams are VERY easy; Greene is an amazing lecturer; section is fabulous; and do not be intimidated by the project. TAKE THIS COURSE!","This is a very fun class, I took it senior spring as an elective and it was perfect! Take this!! The professor and TFs are great, the work load is very manageable, and the material is endlessly interesting","Review the lectures online, Josh is great! Plan ahead for your final project as you will have to collect data.","Great intro course to social psych. Very interesting material and lectures are well done. Sections were useless and mandatory","This is a great introductory psychology class that can be very interesting at times. The workload is more than manageable and if you study moderately you should do very well on the exams.","It's an awesome class if you're interested in psychology but not the brain anatomy + physiology aspect of it. Super fun and concepts will be useful in life!","lots of memorization!!! most of your grade will be determined by how good you are at taking multiple choice tests. also, it's mostly from lectures, not the textbook.","Take this class for some amazing insights into human nature, but know that the grading scheme could be greatly approved.","This was a great class. Professor Greene is a funny guy, he chooses some interesting studies to present and you start to see a lot of the dynamics playing out in real life. I'd often think to myself \"that response sounds like cognitive dissonance\" or \"that reaction is a classic example of the fundamental attribution error\". Many of the things you learn about play out in real life, and you can even use that to your advantage when persuading people or determining how someone will react. You can make people like you more by mimicking, put someone in a better mood by placing a pencil in their mouth or get your friend to help you move using the door-in-the-face technique. It's kinda fun to test some of the material on your friends, and it reveals a lot about human nature. Oh, and the final project was fun too.\r\n\r\nThe only part I didn't like was that lectures were a little fast at times. Make sure your notes reflect what he's saying more than they do what's on the slides, because you may not have time to write everything down (if you've taken other big lecture courses though then you're probably used to this) I found that studying the slides AND notes about what he said was most helpful. Also, DO THE READING BEFORE THE EXAM! The reading is never discussed, but it WILL be on the exam so make sure you remember some of the cool study results described in the book. No need to remember names usually... the exams are all multiple choice (except for maybe 1 essay question on the final).\r\n\r\nAlso, you don't need SLS 20. I took SLS 20 with Pinker, and the only overlap I can remember right now was Milgram (you'll re-learn that in this class), split-brain studies (covered in more detail in SLS 20... sortof glanced over here) and twin studies (also glanced over here). Other than that the material was pretty new for me, and if it wasn't, it was re-taught well. Definitely take this class. So worth it.","This class is incredibly interesting if you're at all interested psychology. And even if you're not, it will make you interested in psychology. There's so many studies and concepts in this class that couldn't be more counter-intuitive (I know that sounds like it means it's hard, and it kind of does, but it also means it's super interesting). I would recommend this class, but be prepared for tough multiple choice exams with tricky questions about the details of the plethora of studies discussed. It's not hard by Harvard standards but it does require a lot of studying.","overall good class but the tests can be challenging no matter how eel you think you have learned\/ you did in the class","If you're interested in getting a psychological perspective on social phenomena, definitely take this class. Commitment is low, but you do need to read the book in order to do well on exams. Professor Greene is a great lecturer","Take abnormal psych.","The material is extremely interesting.  Take it if you want a painless gen-ed or just want to learn something easy and cool.","A very enjoyable class! You learn a lot about human nature and philosophy and why people act the way they do. Professor Greene is a friendly and perceptive lecturer, and his lectures are very well-structured and, at times, interactive, too. The midterms\/exam are very straightforward and just involve reading the textbook and watching lectures, and the project can be challenging but you get tons of assistance from your TF.","Great class! Be prepared for 2 midterms, a final, and an extensive final project. The exams are fair. You learn quite a lot, and no matter whether you are looking to pursue psychology, the material is still very much applicable to your daily life.","Great class. Professor Green is a great lecturer. All of the theories that you learn in the class are so interesting! Exams are a bit hard, but the final project will bring your grade up.","This class is really interesting. Many of the topics I've learned are very applicable to my life around me. Also, the tests are difficult, but I really enjoyed the final project!","This course is fantastic and not too much work. The material is extremely interesting and applicable to daily life, and Professor Greene is an amazing and engaging lecturer. My one complaint is the testing material; the two midterm exams and one final focus far too heavily, in my opinion, on specific experimenters and their studies rather than the actual psychological theories and concepts themselves, and I think the latter is a more important takeaway from this course."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you're looking for an SLS credit, look no further. This class is by far the best one you'll find. PSY 15 is everything SLS 20 wishes it could be, but with better and fewer assignments and more straightforward exams. Fiery's lectures are engaging and comprehensive, and the material covers a range of topics including racism, game theory, and cultural development, all in a respectful, data-driven way.","This class is easy to the point of boredom. However, the lectures are entertaining and make up for the high school level material. I took this class for the novel experience of designing my own experiment. However, I don't feel like I ended up with an experiment that particularly interested me. You might want to come into this class with some idea of what you already want to do. Be sure to complete all of the weekly assignments. The quick turn-around from Friday (when the assignment is announced) to the deadline (Friday or Saturday night) sometimes caught me off-guard. The class has two multiple-choice exams that count for a combined 45% of your grade. I don't particularly like Multiple-Choice questions, though the exams were fair, in that everything included was something important we learned. Sections are a ridiculous waste of time, but I suppose that may be in-built to science classes.","If Fiery is the lecturer, take this class! And probably take it even if he is not. Don't worry about taking SLS 20 if you haven't; you'll be fine without any prior knowledge of psych. The lectures are great and engaging because of Fiery. Also, make sure you read and know all the textbook's vocab before the midterm and final, because he puts a lot of that stuff on there, and doesn't talk about it in lecture.","Incredible course - Fiery was great and I learned a ton about how individuals work in the context of relationships, society, and an evolutionary standpoint. Only negative was that there were a ton of assignments that seemed like busy-work.","This is definitely a great course to take, even if you aren't going to be a psych concentrator. The content was pretty interesting and the course staff are really helpful\/not trying to make the course more difficult than it has to be. The one recommendation that I would make is to try to keep up readings each week as opposed to trying to wait until the midterm\/final.","This course covers a ton of material, much of which feels like common sense, but you will leave it feeling like you learned a lot of really interesting stuff. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer, although sometimes you may feel overwhelmed because he covers so much in such a short amount of time. The class is minimal work, but you should definitely keep up with the reading because exams include stuff from the textbook that is not covered in class and they can be a little tricky. Definitely spend time studying for exams and get to know your section leader, because they're awesome and really helpful. I definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a fun, pretty easy class that will teach you some basic psychological theory.","Great class. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer.","very interesting class","This is a course that allows you to fulfill SLS easily and gain some dope info.","Super interesting materials. Please, please go to lecture! They're so much fun.","Social psychology is an interesting subject and Fiery is a good lecturer.  There is a significant amount of work each week with textbook reading, weekly assignments, final projects and midterm\/ final prep.","Watch the lecture videos to prepare for the exams.","This course is like Freakanomics in class form with more useful studies and better science.  The lectures were entertaining and they taught counterintuitive and practical aspects of social psychology that can be used in daily life to better understand how people interact.","This course was fantastic. Fiery's lectures were great and section was usually interesting. Take this class if you want to better understand how people operate on a more grand scale and if you're interested in investigating social phenomena that interest you.","The lectures in this course are fascinating and they're all videotaped, which is nice. Section is good. The course is really well-paced, it has you stay up-to-date with the material and the assignments are fairly graded. I took this as my SLS class, and I would definitely recommend it (SLS20 not needed)","Fiery Cushman is by far the best lecturer I have had at Harvard. All of his lecture presentations are extremely interesting, and for some reason remind me of TED talks.","It was great definitely take it even if you think you're not \"good\" at science","Fiery entertains during lecture. The material is engaging and applicable.","Social Psychology is one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard. Fiery Cushman is young, energetic and passionate about what he teaches, and is also an excellent lecturer. The material is engaging and relevant, and the final project provides a low-stress opportunity to sample research in psychology. There are eight short weekly assignments of 150-250 words in addition to the final project, which includes a 1000-word commentary assignment, a short proposal, and the report itself, which is 2000 words. The course staff does a good job walking you through the steps of the project, including the write-up and the statistical analysis they expect. The lectures are videotaped, but I definitely suggest attending class, and then you can re-watch the lectures to study for the midterm and final. The midterm and final are very fair, and consist of 40 and 60 4-answer multiple choice questions, respectively. Sections are mandatory, but really helpful. Laura was a fantastic TF, and very accessible. It is very possible to do well in this class with a reasonable amount of effort. (I took it because I was interested in the topic; I'm not a psych concentrator.) Overall, highly recommend.","TAKE IT!!! It will change the way you approach group settings and social situations.  The lectures are extremely interesting and engaging.  I really did have fun reading the text, going to class, doing the assignments and project, participating in studies, even studying for the exams.  Fiery was great!!  If he keeps teaching it, definitely take it with him.","This class is really really cool and Fiery is such a great lecturer!! If you're looking for some way to fulfill SLS, this is the way to do it. It is objectively a really interesting and relevant to your life and this world, and it is a subject matter that I think should be incorporated into many more courses. Definitely do readings.. that's the only way to do well on the midterm and final. The project is the most fun part! have fun with it.","take it. take it as a fifth, a sixth class, it's worth it because this material will shape how you perceive others and how they perceive you; invariably, for the better","Fiery is the best lecturer I've ever had, and makes all the material extremely intuitive and interesting (although it is pretty interesting in the first place). Would definitely recommend as the best way to fulfill SLS.","Fiery is, without a doubt, one of the best lecturers at Harvard. The lectures are recorded, but I would not miss it. You'll do better on the exams and leave with a great understanding of social psychology.","Attending sections is great review. READ THE TEXTBOOK. There are things not covered in lecture that show up on exams that made me regret not reading.","TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S A PERFECT GEN ED","Social psychology by the nature of its discipline is a wonderful intersection between biology and the social sciences that can fascinate students from any backgrounds. The course is designed wonderfully and the lectures are wonderful.","Good course - lectures are engaging. You don't need to buy the textbook. Grading is fine, as long as you vaguely pay attention in class.","This class is incredibly interesting. The weekly assignments make you keep up with the class, and sections are mandatory.  Don't procrastinate on reading your book!! It will take time to think of a counter-theory. You get to conduct an experiment (it can be observational), and they don't grade you very harshly, which is considerate given most people have never run a psych experiment.","Take this class! Fiery is a really engaging lecture, and the course material - which can be quite convoluted at times - is very well organized and explained. Make sure to study both the book and lectures in preparation for the midterm and final.","This is by far my favorite course at Harvard. It has the rare combination of being fascinating and relatively little work. You usually get fascinating\/impossible or boring\/easy courses but this one had the best of both worlds. Fiery is so passionate about what he teaches that lecture is truly fun. I enjoyed every minute of this class and I'm really disappointed that this class had to end.","This class is very very exciting and interesting and fun. Lectures are definitely worth going to. Fiery Cushman is a great lecturer! The material is extremely interesting and relevant. This is a great elective \/ gen-ed.","PSY15 is amazing!!! Definitely take it with Fiery!","Really good gen-ed or elective--you learn a lot, the information is presented very well, and it's pretty low-stress","If you're looking for an interesting and engaging class with relatively low commitment, then this is the class for you. Professor Cushman was awesome and he really engaged the students with the material.","I recommend this class strongly to all students, no matter one's academic interest. It is impossible not to find the course material applicable to most aspects of your life, daily and otherwise. You'll find yourself thinking differently.","This is a class with great bang for your buck. Fiery is an astoundingly dynamic lecturer, and every presentation will have you laughing, or, at the very worst, at the edge of your seat in rapt interest. The material is very engaging, though if you don't have a personal interest in understanding the concepts of social psychology, then I really don't suggest taking this class for an \"easy Gen Ed\" or something. There's a lot to cover, and you will get swamped if you're bored. That being said, it is very hard to be bored with this subject, especially with the fantastic way in which Fiery presents the material. I don't believe I've taken a better course at Harvard yet.","Take this class if you are interested in how and why people behave the way they do.","You learn lots of interesting things about psychology and better understand how people think. Lectures were engaging.","It's a good SLS course.","Fiery is an amazingly engaging professor, and the course material actually changed the way I think about things in everyday life. Take it if Fiery teaches again.","This course is extremely interesting. I enjoyed both, going to lectures and reading the material in the textbook. You will learn more about yourself and others by examining the social relationships between people. Although interesting, this course is challenging. Since the material covered in class is not the same as what is in the textbook, you have to keep up with readings and lectures. I recommend reading a chapter per week and attending all lectures as to not fall behind.","With Fiery as an instructor, this course is more \"science-y\" (greater emphasis on the brain and on biological explanation) than you might expect a social psychology course to have. Nevertheless, it is completely manageable if you are a humanities person. The material is by definition applicable to the real world, and you will find yourself referencing concepts from the course multiple times a day. A frustration with the course is that the exams are very definition based -- you may understand all the concepts perfectly, but if you didn't sit down to make flashcards and memorize a specific definition, you could easily fail.","Pay attention! The information is helpful, interesting, and amazing.","This course is highly recommended for all students who are looking find out more about emotions, attitudes, behavior, and more. It is easy to think that you know everything about yourself, but this course raises many thought-provoking points that I am sure most people are unaware of.","Really solid class.","Great class! Tough exams, but you learn a lot","It's very light work for most of the semester (short assignments which don't take time if you were at lecture), but studying for exams takes time because you need to read the large textbook as well as re-watch the lecture videos.","Social Psych is a great class and super applicable to the real world- its a decent amount of work, but definitely worth it.","The lectures are awesome. Definitely worth going to, even though there are videos online. Also, the best possible way to study for exams is to just watch lecture videos again.","This course is really great if you're interested in social psychology. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you like your studying clearly defined - there are a lot of sometimes vague and overlapping terms and theories that can be confusing. I did like the final project as it offers the opportunity to be creative and design your own study, and Professor Cushman was a great lecturer.","I loved this class; the thing about psych is that we often think that the conclusions reached are obvious, but there are often things that we think that are obviously true that are not, in addition to surprising facts about our own psychology that have a large effect on our decisions and attitudes toward various ideas. This class will teach you all about that and will also allow you to engage with the material on a more personal level since you'll get to conduct your own experiment. The source books that you read to help you think of an idea for your experiment are interesting in themselves as well. The TFs are nice and available if you have questions, and Fiery's pretty cool as well. The exams are very generous on time, and the staff even used a concept from the course on one of the exams to help us out\/give a laugh to those who noticed!","fF you are interested in exposing yourself to the field of Social Psychology, and covering a breadth of topics within the field, this class is perfect for you. If you are simply interested in learning how people think, and operate, I believe that is a quality course for you as well. This class was not always the most engaging class for me, but if you are someone with a strong interest in Social Psychology you will find this class very interesting and engaging.","Be sure to attend section for recap of challenging concepts and to rematch lecture slides\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201ceven when you are passively going over the material and think you have mastered it, learning this material is challenging and requires going back over it for many people in this class.","This was a really great class. Fiery is such an engaging lecturer and does a really good job presenting enough, interesting evidence while making it clear how course themes apply to your own life\/the world around us. It's really interesting to learn about and very applicable. It isn't too much work. You'll have weekly assignments but they are quick. There's a commentary on a book-not that consuming. The experiment you'll have to do seems daunting at first but it isn't that bad, you'll get guidance, and if you pick something you care about it is fun to do and illuminating. Really good course and great (stress-free) way to fulfill gen-ed requirements.","You'll learn lots of fun applicable information!","The material presented is quite interesting and the lectures were very clear and well-prepared. Plus, things like the fundamental attribution error and cognitive dissonance are generally useful to know about","If you haven't taken psych before, this is a good introductory course. It is not difficult and does not require a high amount of work; it's possible to do well without ever attending lectures or owning the textbook if you are willing to study hard for exams.","This course IS SO RELEVANT. Legit. It sheds light on so many human idiosyncrasies: why we believe what we believe; how our individual selves are so heavily influenced by the external. Take this before graduating! It'll help you become a better human being and more self-aware.","It's a very good class as a first psychology class.","This class put into perspective for me just how many biases I have in the way I think. The message wasn't that these evolutionary and cultural biases were good or bad; although many of them explain why humans are the most advanced life-forms on Earth. More importantly, though, this class made me examine the way I think, either because I was raised to approach situations a certain way, or because it's an innate response. Now I know to make sure I push myself farther when thinking critically, and to make sure I'm not falling back on some tendency or bias that clouds my judgment of the situation. I know what traps I am prone to falling into, whether evaluating criminals, different cultures, or moral situations. I learned to acknowledge my biases without being proud of them, and stubbornly rooting myself in them.","This was an amazing course, and Fiery articulately teaches with obvious enthusiasm about the subject matter. Social psychology is incredibly important in retrospect, and it has enabled me to scrutinize human interaction on a whole new level. Take this if Fiery is teaching!","This class is awesome, just make sure you go to lecture and read the textbook, both are tested in exams. Otherwise, awesome class.","Professor Cushman is an engaging, funny and generally fantastic lecturer.  He'll make you want to come to class. Additionally, the topics covered are interesting and make you think about the world in a whole new way. I highly recommend this class for the interesting projects (a book review and a research project) and topics.\n\nThe annoying part of this class are the required 5 study pool credits, which are pitched as a learning opportunity, but really are a way for the Psych department to get unpaid labor for their studies in a way that no other department does (trying to imagine a Government or Behavioral Economics class that required you to participate in studies without compensation - really, this should hardly be allowed). Rather than being a learning experience, this requires you to sit through hours of completely mind-numbing and mindless activities (for example, one of my studies involved having images flashed at me for 1.5 hours while I guessed what color they were - I got my learning experience out of it after the first 20 minutes). Another annoying bit is how much the mid-terms and exams rely on textbook readings and terms that are not mentioned or covered in class, which makes it difficult to understand how to fit them into the context of the course.","Psych 15 was a great way to do SLS. I am not a psych concentrator and had not taken SLS 20 and it was still very approachable. The material is not easy - you need to put some time in when it comes to exams and give the assignments some real thought, but most of the content was really interesting. The midterm was mostly fair and straightforward. A lot of what made this class great was Fiery - he's a really good lecturer and has an amazing way of making complicated concepts very clear, especially to people with no psych background.","Social psych is a great way to do SLS, much better than SLS 20. It's far more interesting and it's easier. Fiery is a great lecturer but they're also recorded so you can go back and watch. All of the assignments are fairly straightforward and kind of fun.","Great course to fulfill the SLS gen ed. In my opinion, the most painless SLS class. I don't know if I learned a lot from this class though; it's a relaxed easy class.","I would recommend this course to anyone with even the slightest bit of interest in psychology. Professor Cushman is so knowledgeable and his lectures are very engaging. The exams are fair; the written assignments are thoughtfully designed and often leave room for creativity. The highlight of the semester is definitely the final project, in which each student has the opportunity to design and conduct a social psychology experiment.","Please attend the lectures in person, for your own sake. You'll remember the material better if you go.","Fiery is a fantastic lecturer: intriguing, relatable, and fun!  The information is something that everyone should learn in order to understand the world around them and how we as humans interact with other humans.","Amazing lectures and Fiery is awesome! Everyone who is interested in social psychology should take this course! It will make you think a lot. Key to do well on the exams: read the book & take notes during the year; during reading period - rewatch the lecture videos and review notes. Nothing is tricky on the exam, very straightforward.","Fiery's lectures are an absolute treat\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe does a truly phenomenal job of making the information relevant, weighty, and fresh. I definitely wouldn't worry about taking SLS 20 before this class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere's some, but not too much, overlap. Finally, aside from ease of grading, there's no reason why the exams for this class need to be multiple choice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI would highly recommend that future iterations of the course change this to a short response-style exam, which demands accurate, rather than vague, understanding of the concepts tested.","Interesting lectures with a passionate instructor. Painless assignments.","Fiery is an engaging lecturer, and the material is interesting.","Fiery is a powerhouse academic who will become a huge name in the field in the years to come.  A pleasure and an honor to learn from him.","If you are interested in examining psychology through different lenses, like combining the subject with anthropology, biology, sociology, etc., I would take this class. Personally I often felt lost because it seemed like I was no longer in a psychology class when we were discussing some concepts because they either seemed out of context or were very difficult to connect back to the big picture. Fiery is humorous and an overall great guy, but his lectures aren't very structured and it often took me at least one rewatch of the lecture recording to understand how and why certain studies and ideas were relevant to the bigger topic.","This is a solid class that covers an array of concepts in social psychology, ranging from stereotyping and prejudice to attraction and relationships. The material is engaging (and super applicable to your everyday life), the workload is on the lighter side, and the professor is really great as well. Recommended.","This is a great class. Professor Cushman is an amazing lecturer; he's always enthusiastic and has a great sense of humor, and is also usually interactive. He's clearly excited about the subject matter and it's infectious. You cover all sorts of topics related to social psychology, from baby morality to why people become addicted to cocaine. Really interesting subject material, plus, it's not too difficult of a class in the slightest.","Fiery is the best lecturer! Seriously, all professors at Harvard are smart and brilliant people, but NOT everyone is a good lecturer\/teacher. Even though some contents\/concepts in this class overlap with SLS 20 or some other psychology seminars, the way Fiery presents the topics are still so interesting that I couldn't wait to go to lectures every week. (Watch out for the lecture where he does vocal fry!!!) He is also very accessible outside class (which is another thing that not every other professor is good at!) \n\nThere is a weekly assignment that takes about like 0.5-1 hour a week to complete, but overall the workload is not that overwhelming (though it looks like there are a lot!) The TFs are super helpful. Overall the teaching staff are always there for any questions, concerns, and any help you need to complete the assignments.","TAKE PSYCH 15!!!!!! It's unquestionably one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard so far, not only because of Fiery - who is incredibly insightful, funny, and personable as a professor and a person - but also because of the sheer content of the course. Social psychology is so interesting and applicable to real life, and there is no better way to learn about it than from someone who knows as much about it as Fiery in this course. It's also a very manageable workload and all of the assignments are pertinent and meaningful, and you will find yourself looking forward to lecture and all of the new ideas and insights you will come away from each day.","The class provided a great foundation for psychology in general and covered a wide range of topics, but the exams are both all multiple choice and cover material from both lecture and the book, so you have to either stay on top of your readings during the semester or spend a super long time cramming before the exam. Pretty great class though!","This is a really interesting class. Fiery is an amazing lecturer, so you'll genuinely enjoy going to class. Assignments are very few and relatively simple and the final project is pretty fun (develop your own psych study), but definitely study a lot for the one midterm and final exam.","I took this class as a senior to fulfill SLS. The material is interesting, relevant to your life\/interactions\/groups\/Harvard\/etc. However, this is not the easiest way to fulfill the requirement. It also requires a lot of memorization and the assessment is not easy. It is a lot of memorization. Fiery was great and everyone say's Greene is great too. You can't go wrong. It's manageable in that it is videotaped, has clear expectations, and will not require much work on the week to week assignments. However, the midterm\/finals require a lot of studying and are quite difficult - even if you think you are good at memorizing. They do curve them, slightly, though.","The material is interesting, but the lectures are somewhat dry. A decent number of questions on the midterm and final will cover material from the textbook so make sure to do the readings. Sections were fun and interactive!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"3.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"166","response rate":"77.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 15","course_id":"4231","cat_num":"4760","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"15","4s":"49","5s":"63"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 15","course_id":"4231","cat_num":"4760","1s":"8","2s":"55","3s":"109","4s":"21","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 15","course_id":"4231","cat_num":"4760","1s":"38","2s":"67","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
