'09":{"comments":["This class was really hard and was not so fun at the time but in hindsight I feel like I really learned a lot.","It is easier than chem 30, and it is a lot more biology oriented if you prefer that rather than a more pure chemistry course.","hard, but interesting material-- I would only recommend if they needed the course for a requirement.","lecture is not worth going to - you are better off going through the lecture notes, doing practice problems and understanding the mechanisms yourself with that time, than sitting passively and pretending that you're gaining information.","Unlike Chem 17, which throws massive amounts of information at you, Chem 27 takes basic concepts and applies them to biologically relevant situations in a way that is not overwhelming and is easy to understand.","If you're coming in from Chem 17, it's very different so be prepared. Chem 17 was very much about learning a lot of the basic mechanisms. Chem 27 is focuses a lot more on a few select mechanisms that can be used for different purposes.","It is hard and not usually fun, but it is doable and interesting.","Bunch of pre med students in class, if you're not hog wild about chemistry, take this in place of the much much much harder chem 30.","only if want to learn, should take this class","Read the background notes before class, and definitely do the practice problems in the workbook!","Chem27 is difficult and requires a lot of work, but the material covered is very interesting and useful.","Its very interesting and applicable","work hard, and you will do well!","If you need to take organic chemistry you will enjoy this class tremendously, much more than Chem 17.  However, the level of work (class & lab hours) required means that I would not recommend it to anyone who wasn't required to take the course.","This is a baller class. No joke. Amazing topics, great choice of example enzymes. Fascinating intersection of biology and chemistry.","It's hard to actually get excited about the material.  It's good analytics and problem solving if that's what you're into.","This is a great opportunity to explore the amazing way chemistry explains the biology in our bodies.","A biochemistry class. Unlike Chem 17. A lot of memorization, a lot of mechanisms. Good if you are interested in enzyme chemistry. Practical applications.","A very challenging course","It is very different compared to Chem 17.","This class takes a lot of time, but if you can put in the effort, you will learn a lot.","This class may be amazing or may be horrible. It may be amazing if you're really into science and the type of problem solving skills it requires. However, if you're really not into the topic, it will be painful.","the curve is harsh","Only take this class if absolutely necessary.","very time consuming, interesting, and beneficial","If you like organic chem and\/or biochemistry, you will love this class.  If you just want to fulfill a pre-med req, take it over the summer or at a different university.","This course covers a very large amount of material in a short amount of time. Therefore, you need to be very organized when preparing for this course (i.e. no cramming). I personally found the practice problems very helpful.","Take the course seriously because it is a difficult class. It seems easier than Chem 17, but can become overwhelming.","Chem 27 is organized very well, though the problem sets and tests vary in difficulty widely, which sometimes makes it hard to prepare.","It's not as scary as people make it seem. It's really just a combination of orgo and bio.","Practice exams under time pressure because exams are designed to be longer than the allotted time","not hard","The class is an eclectic mix of examples drawn from biology. While some of the topics are interesting, there is a distinct lack of different types of reactions. If you have taken chem 17 or chem 20, you have learned all the chemistry. This class just applies it to biological systems. I'm not sure how much of the stuff I learned in this class I'll remember.","If you work hard this is one of the most rewarding classes you will take at Harvard. If you need help and look for it, you'll find it. Everyone involved in the course is very accessible and willing to help students if they want it. It's a fantastic introduction into the basic biology and chemistry of life, and it will open your eyes to all of the reactions and processes that keep our bodies going on a daily basis. This class makes me love orgo more.","Only take it if you have to - definitely take this over chem 30. It is more of a biochemistry class than a chemistry class.","Good course for people interested in chemical biology.","It is  a great way to start applying organic chemistry to biological systems.  If you are interested in the details of how living oranisms work, this class is a great starting point.","It requires a lot of work, but is very rewarding to finish","It is a hard class, but it's worth your time. You can do well if willing to put in the work.","If you work hard, it is very straight-forward and can be very enjoyable, as the material is interesting.","This class is very different from Chem 17, so it takes a long time to get used to, but it is very interesting once you get the hang of it.","Organic Chem is AWESOME and its even more AWESOME when you get to apply it to biology!","This is a very good class.","Be sure to utilize all of the online materials for this course, particularly the review notes and practice problems.","For pre-meds, you've got to take it. If you put in the time and really dedicate yourself to the class, you will undoubtedly enjoy it. The stuff is cool.","Difficult exams- lecture notes are very comprehensive.","make an effort to stay abreast of the work, but a rewarding course","It is very challenging, but rewarding.  You will be proud of yourself after completing this course and the information is useful.","if you like chemistry","This class expands on knowledge gained from the first semester of organic chemistry and applies it to other areas such as biology.","extremely difficult","The material is very interesting. By the end of the semester you'll be able to understand much of the biochemical transformations that happen in life and many pharmaceutical approaches. It is not too difficult, and help is always available if needed. It's a very relevant and suitable course for pre-med and pre-pharm students, to whom I actually recommend with enthusiasm.","Make study guides for the exams and do as many practice problems as you can.","a lot of biochemistry","It sucks but it's orgo... ya know but if you can take summer orgo definitely do!!","put time into this class and you will get more out of it.","This class is awesome. The material is great, the problem sets are fun, and what you learn is directly applicable to pharmacology and medicine. TAKE IT!","only if you're premed, like chemistry, or are insane","Very good class for pre-meds because it puts organic chemistry in a biological perspective, something that is useful to know as a prospective doctor","As long as you attend lectures and do the practice problems, this course is completely manageable and not at all difficult.","It is entirely doable and not painful if you keep yourself motivated for the entire semester (Which is hard because the lectures get so boring!)","Make sure you keep up with the work. The practice tests are super-important for seeing what types of problems will show up on your own exams. Take the time to understand the material from readings and class notes, then do a lot of practice problems to review and make sure all the mechanisms are second nature to you. You won't have time on the exams to figure out basics.","The material ties together very well in the end. Also, peer leader sections are very useful in addition to regular section.","You have to work hard, but it is worth it","Prepare to work hard","I really, really enjoyed and did well in Chem 17, but struggled a lot in Chem 27. Make sure you keep up with the practice problems even though they are not actually assigned!","Great class overall. Very well structured.","More interesting than Chem 17 if you like to see the biological applications.","Do the practice problems!","It has a good approach to chemistry, and if you have to take organic chemistry, this is a great alternative to the traditional approach. That being said, since it's a non-traditional type of class, there are some sections and approaches that are still being worked out by the course staff, so not everything is smoothe.","Take this course only if it is a requirement. Be prepared to donate a lot of time to studying and working on problem sets, and do not be afraid to contact TFs and the preceptor for help","This course is very interesting since it directly relates to the body during each and every lecture.","Good class. Interesting subject material. Decent lectures and excellently written textbook and lecture notes.","It's more interesting to learn than Chem 17, but parts of the chemistry is just not really explained.","good for pre-med students, lots of drug applications","practice, practice, practice. Do problem sets. Read the preceptor handouts - they are much better than the background readings.","It's pretty cool learning about the chemistry that your body does. It's like magic, but takes a lot of work and memorization.","If someone wants to work hard and is interested in the material, I would recommend this course.","It's certainly not easy, but it's a much more rewarding class than Chem 17, is well-taught, and goes over a lot of interesting material.","It takes concepts from Chem 17 and applies them in real biological situations.","I'm sure the new professors (whoever they are) will be better than the professors our year. The TFs are good.","If you must...","It's a good way to fulfill the organic chemistry requirement, especially because it focuses on questions relevant to biology and medicine.  The drug development and enzyme catalysis portions were especially interesting.","Be sure to be prepared for a difficult class, and if possible, take the course during the summer when you can devote a large amount of time.","Chem 27 provides a good, comprehensive understanding of chemistry in biology.","unless needed for pre-med, or if you really just love chemistry","Definitely not the same as Chem17. Takes a much different approach and getting accustomed to the changes isn't easy.","Much better than Chem 17. A safe haven for biology students.","If you are pre-med you have to take this course, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it unless you really like or are good at chemistry.","It is a well taught class, sometimes really boring.","The teaching fellows are not always effective in sections.","very interesting biological spin on chemistry","not as hard as they say it is.","Lots of work","very memorization based- unless chemical biology is your passion, you'll probably forget everything in a few weeks","Much different than chem 17.

It is not an easy class, but in the end, can be rewarding.","As a biologist, this is will complement your learning and make everything make more sense.","This is your basic orgo course.  While lab is a pain overall this is a good course to take for pre med requirements.","It is amazing.","very difficult","Take it if you need to fulfill the premed requirement.  It will be difficult and a lot of work, but it is very manageable.","It's not possible to do well in chem 27 without fellow student help--work in big study groups to be the most successful.","It's orgo but fun. Plus it counts as the biochemistry requirement.","Read the preceptor hand-outs!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Keep a list of mechanisms as you learn them and practice.","Chem 27 is well-organized class with a positive atmosphere and great teaching staff. You will learn A LOT about some of the big chemical processes that happen in your body. There are so many office hours and resources, so if your fear is struggling alone, fear not! If you take advantage of the resources that the course has to offer (practice problems, practice exams, very friendly and dedicated teaching staff), you will come away with a great learning experience.","If you have to take the course, there is not much avoiding it. However, if you can, try to start freshman year, everything you need to know comes from Chem 17 and taught in 27, so they are very insular.","This is a really interesting class but make sure you have the time to dedicate to it in order to learn the most and really enjoy it.","Chem 27 covers more difficult material than Chem 17, but the topics are more interesting and applicable to biology.","Don't take this class unless you have to.","remember to write the coproducts","After chem 17, the chemistry in this class is not extremely involved. I found that the toughest part of this class was deciphering which small details we needed to know for tests. The material involves large chemistry concepts that are applied in biological settings. These biological settings however are described with way too many details, most of which you do not need to know.","Moves very slowly.  Takes off points for very silly and insignificant things.  Sometimes it seems like they are trying to mark off as many points as possible, instead of trying to get the students to understand.","Make sure to get started on the practice problems as soon as you learn the material!","Chemistry 27 is undoubtedly difficult, but it also by far the most organized and well-structured course that I have taken thus far at Harvard. Unlike many Life Sciences classes that are unorganized, ambiguous, and vague, Marie Spong has dedicated herself toward making sure that this class runs smoothly for each and every student. Never once did I complain about a lack of resources or answer keys that were unsatisfying. I always knew what was expected of me, and I knew that the amount of work and effort I put into the class by practicing problems directly correlated with how well I did on exams. Though the material is not always the most interesting, the class itself is probably the best I have taken thus far at Harvard.","The lecturing isn't particularly good, but it's a very cool, very rewarding class if you put the appropriate amount of time into it.","This class is doable as long as you work hard, go to TFs when you questions and go over the lecture notes. Make sure you check you psets with other people!","Chem 27 is really well organized. This class is by no means easy, but I the way it integrates biology and chemistry fascinating. There are plenty of resources for students seeking any kind of help, the psets are comprehensive, and many materials are made available to help study for exams. As far as pre-med requirements go, I would say that this is one of the few that I genuinely enjoyed, irrespective of the amount of work it required.","Even if 20\/30 is supposedly harder, it seems like everyone I know who took 20\/30 is happier than those of us who took 17\/27.\r\n\r\nIf you're committed to 27: Reading the material isn't enough. Memorizing the mechanisms isn't enough. To do well in this class, you need to understand the underlying chemistry well enough to be creative. You'll need to get good at mental rotation, *really* understand pKa, be able to explain why a molecule fits into a binding site in much more detail than \"Because the residues are in the right positions to stabilize the charge.\" You'll need to be able to count and draw very accurately and very quickly. You'll need to have some kind of freaky sense of perspective when interpreting PyMol questions - I never would have imagined that I could be wrong about which object is closest to another object. I've heard getting good at orgo compared to learning another language, but you only need to acquire one new skill to learn a new language.","This is not your normal organic chemistry course, so don't be hesitant. There are many applications to biology building upon previous organic chemistry knowledge, and there are a lot more applications than mechanisms to memorize.","Although this class has much potential, much remains to be worked out, particularly on the logistical front of problem sets and exams.  I would recommend that students that can afford to wait a year or two before taking this class do so.  \r\n\r\nFor 20\/30 veterans, the material isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t difficult at all, but the grading right now is very much based on perfection in adhering to course guidelines on showing mechanisms.  Take the class if you like, but be aware of this going in.","This class is harder than chem 17. I went in excited to be learning about the biological aspects of chemistry, but that gets lost in the extremely difficult mechanisms and concepts. I still am not sure how any of the concepts we learned would be applied to physiology. For some people organic chemistry just clicks, but for some people (myself included), it is a continuous struggle. At Harvard it seems professors assume it will just click for everyone. Most stressful and difficult class I've taken here- seriously just hoping I passed.","Do many practice problems!","It's rare to find a difficult course where it's really possible to put in the time and have it show, yet Chem27 really strikes the right balance with it. There are lots of resources with practice problems and all kinds of peer study leader sessions, sections...etc. This takes a lot of time but it's really really worth it and generally it will show in the results. You probably don't have much of a choice to take this class, but honestly this is, while very time consuming, very interesting and very doable. Lab is a little tedious, but it could be a lot worse.","Two resources: Peer Leaders and Practice Problems. Do these and you will perform well. Also, keep the grading in mind--it's not curved, per se so data on averages\/standard deviations are unnecessary. Work to finish your psets two days before they are due and go to Lab TFs office hours (otherwise you will spend more time than is needed to figure out answers to  lab quizzes). Because your grade comes from basically 4 exams, practice problem, practice exams, and the review session will cover most of what you need to know. That said, if you screw up a midterm, don't worry--Chem 27 final is better prepared than the Chem 17 final. I had 4 pset classes, so being able to go to office hours was hard for me, so try to balance your load and go out to meet the professors once in a while--both Dr. Balskus and Dr. Spong are good resources.","This class is very well organized and well taught. The TFs, peer leaders, and professors are fantastic, and the material learned is very interesting. All the resources necessary to succeed are provided for you, if you are willing to put in the work!","This class is hard, but definitely worth it.","Tough course with a lot of work and long labs, but the TFs at section and office hours can help a lof in preparation for Psets and tests. If you put time and focus in the course (and are good at chemistry) you can do well.","Chem 27 is a very well-organized course! The teaching staff (especially Dr. Sprong) care a lot about the students and try very hard to make the course accessible to everyone. However, the exams are tough (the average for the first two were in the 60s) and really require you to master the material. There is a biological as well as chemical component (it is the organic chemistry of life) so that can be tricky, especially as you're learning about enzymes and inhibitors, etc. The material can be interesting, but the lectures can sometimes diverge and not be as helpful (the FAS\/PKS\/NRPS stuff could have been better taught). Prepare to spend a lot of time on the course, and possibly not get the best grade.","I absolutely adored Chem 27!!! This course is a definite if you are interested in organic chemistry and if you want an idea of how the principles of organic chemistry apply to biological processes.  However, although this course is well run and is enjoyable, do not be fooled.  Biochemistry is very difficult and you need to stay on top of the material.  One of the strengths of this course is that the material builds on itself so that when you get to oxidative metabolism at the end of the class, the all of the mechanisms that you have seen throughout the course become important.  So definitely keep up with the material, but the teaching staff is wonderful and definitely able to help you.  The problem sets are easy, but the practice problems and the exams are not.  Definitely do the practice problems in the book before each exam.  They will be your SAVING GRACE!  The practice problems are sometimes harder than the exam problems, so if you can do them, the exam will be manageable.  Go to office hours and use your teaching fellow.  Professor Balskus is wonderful, and she and Dr. Spong are very enthusiastic about the material.  Both of them and the entire teaching staff really want you to succeed!  I didn't really like the lab component of the class, but it's all pass\/fail, except for the lab quizzes, so just get through it, and put your energy into the other aspects of the course.","If you love puzzle solving and have good endurance you will love this class. Actually though, it's a pretty good class once you put in the time to learn the basic mechanisms. I found it really interesting!","This course will take a long time and it won't be easy.","Honestly, this class ended up being pretty solid. Organic chemistry is all about time commitment, so if you put in the work you'll be fine. But you do have to  be really disciplined about doing and completely understanding problem sets, getting through labs, and always reviewing lecture material- because old stuff in the course always comes back into play. This class was also really good about giving what you needed to study and was super clear about what you needed to know, so I always felt that the work I put in was productive and did translate to success. I also found the biological aspects of it interesting and overall a much better class than chem17 (but a lot of people have the opposite opinion...). The labs also ended up being manageable. So all in all I highly recommend and definitely makes the 17\/27 year better than 20\/30.","Do the practice problems. Also be very proactive and attend sections\/PSL's. Take the time to make review guides if you want that A","It took me a while to realize what was important to study to do well in this class, but I think I figured it out by the end. The lectures aren't that important. They are really only important to introduce the material. Very few concepts outside of mechanisms are actually ever tested, so don't bother much with general concepts (and the few that are important will return several times, so you'll know the few that are important). Literally, all you have to do to do well is practice problems. I know it's tough to add to your schedule, but do all the practice problems for each week of lectures directly after those lectures are done and you will be golden. Just a couple hours every weekend. Practice al the mechanisms over and over again, and you will do great.","Be ready to spend a lot of time thoroughly learning the material and logic behind the mechanisms. You'll love it once you start understanding the concepts.","Hardest class I've taken, grading is very unstandardized across sections and for exams, Labs are tough when your TF can not speak english that well, Chem TFs from earlier chem courses and other high level chem people are allowed to take the course for some reason and skew the curve.","This course was undoubtedly the most well organized and well structured courses I have taken. The Balskus-Spong duo is fantastic. The course instructors care about you and provide you with the necessary materials to succeed. That said, it is up to you to put in the time and effort to understand the material well.","It will take some time to do well.","You know it's going to be really hard.  This course is truly excellent in terms of how it is run.  Just put the time in on a weekly basis.  Do practice problems.  Learn the concepts well.  You will not be tested on the exact same mechanisms you learned, but on variations, and to get those you need to understand the lecture content.  Oh yeah, and it's hard.","Be sure to dedicate a lot of time to this course - if you want to do well, you need to do practice problems very regularly","Okay Im going to give you the secret to a good grade in orgo. Ready? Study EVERY DAY for at least an hour. Go over a lecture, do practice problems, make links between the concepts in class and clinical medicine if that will motivate you to learn it. But do it EVERY DAY. Im not kidding. I really did not enjoy orgo until I started doing that and now I am thinking about a chemistry concentration. I will actually miss this class and I had a deep dislike for orgo before I started doing the hour-a-day thing. Changed my life. Actually. Do it. Yes it is going to hurt. But less than failing the class.","Practice, practice, practice, office hours and PSL review sessions should get you smoothly through the course. I highly recommend the course for its interesting material and very helpful teaching staff. Orgo preferences differ--some people like this better than Chem 17 because the biological contextualization makes the chemistry more interesting. This was the case for me, as I was better able to appreciate the chemistry having known how it functions in real life. Others prefer 17 in part for the opposite reason\u00e2\u20ac\u201dChem 17 seems more varied in its mechanisms and may appeal\/have appealed more to the more hard-core chem students. Take Chem 27, or at least shop it!","The material in this class is pretty interesting; you'll learn a lot about enzyme catalysis and inhibitor design, which is very relevant to drug discovery and design. However, the material itself is not that hard, so the class is very focused on small details to create a distribution, which can be frustrating. I'd definitely think twice about taking this class if you don't have to. The inconsistent grading and focus on relativity insignificant details when grading exams is a headache, and you'll find yourself worrying more about making stupid mistakes and writing mechanisms exactly the way they want you to, rather than focusing on the material itself.","Do all of the practice problems.","Organic chemistry generally isn't a course that people look forward to, but I ended up actually liking this course. Everything is presented really clearly, tests were fair, and there were so many resources available for help. I learned a lot and liked that things made sense.","Just do all the practice problems and you will be ready for the exam. However, don't think that you can finish all of them in just two or three days before the exam (except for midterm 1).","Go to as many PSL sections as possible and do the practice problems well before exams begin.","I was surprised to see how much I ended up enjoying this class. The teaching staff was great my year, and Prof Balskus and Marie Spong are both really nice teachers who are worth getting to know. If you are willing to put in the work to review all the problems before exams, you will do just fine.","They definitely give you all the tools that you need to succeed in this class. If you use them, the class is very manageable and fair.","This course is a requirement, so you have to take it whether you want to or not. The material is not too difficult if you practice it often, but the exams are very tricky and overall I felt as if no matter how much studying and time I put into the course, I could not improve my scores. Overall, it was frustrating and grueling, and took a toll on my other classes and extracurriculars. However, since you have to take it, I think doing the practice problems is the best way to study for this course, and they should be done each day instead of all before the exams.","Staying on top of the material - during and after lecture - is key to success in this course. Do NOT fall behind on practice problems!","This is the best course that I have taken at Harvard, mainly because of the information learned throughout the semester!","This course is VERY promising, but in the end, it did not meet my expectations fully. I really wanted it to be put in the context of biology more. At the beginning of the course, this was happening and I was very happy with it. But as the course went on, lectures began starting with simply \"this happens with this medicine,\" but did not cover where in the body, when, or for what reason. Sometimes going to office hours was crowded, so getting help was difficult. But overall the course was very helpful and I learned a lot. If you put in a lot of time you will get a lot out. Doing the practice exams are very very helpful for the midterms.","This is a phenomenal course for examining the molecular details of life. You've learned the definition of what an enzyme is and what it does. But have you ever seen it down to the atomic level? That's what Chem27 is all about.","Use Professor Balskus and Professor Spong. They are eager to help and do so with kindness. No problem is too big or small for Professor Spong, especially. This course was really difficult, but I learned from the struggle thanks to her.","You better be really detailed oriented. Details like + and - signs.","they're very nitpicky, but as long as you're a good pre-med and cross your t's and dot your i's, you'll be fine. keep up with the problem sets and practice problems, and the exam will be a breeze. it's a very straightforward class, and you'll be fine.","If you liked Chem 17, you will also enjoy Chem 27","Every class operates differently but most pre-med classes always fall into the more or less same formula to do well. Here is my suggestion for what to do, and what worked for me. Go to lecture and try to pay attention. It probably won't happen all the time and when Marie is teaching it gets a bit more difficult; Balskus is awesome though. Make a schedule and ACTUALLY DO practice problems as you go along. Try do do a few before you tackle the problem sets. FORCE yourself to do them otherwise you'll end up looking at the answer key days before each exam because there are too many to do before taking the practice exam. GO TO PSL sessions. They are literally the best thing ever. The PSL people have taken the course before and will have their own study guides for you. These were always the most useful resources to do well exams. When exams come around make sure you actually get through all the practice exams. The class is very enjoyable. There is real life context to everything you learned in chem 17.","If you have taken 20\/30 and think this class is a good idea: it's not. it's poorly organized and poorly taught. It's NOTHING at all like 20\/30. With that said, it's pretty easy.","The good news: it's over for me. The bad news: it's not over for you! Chemistry 27 is a decently organized second semester organic chemistry class that takes \"annoying pre-med class\" to a new level and will make you hate organic chemistry in a way you never thought possible. \r\n\r\nThe good: The teaching staff provides you with (requires you to purchase) background notes and lecture slides for all the lectures at the beginning of the semester. In addition, you'll get a book of practice problems. The TFs and peer leaders also create weekly handouts summarizing or reviewing important topics from the week. All this is really helpful, and if you make good use of it (i.e - if you can flip through the slides and handouts and then do a few practice problems per week), you can do well in this class. The problem sets are not too long or difficult and are a nice opportunity to review and practice weekly.\r\nAlso, my TF was really nice and helpful. He gave a good conceptual review at the beginning of sections, did a few practice problems with us, and was really good at telling us about mistakes we were frequently committing. He did, however, schedule his office hours during one of the scheduled lab times, so that automatically prevented 1\/4 of the section (including me) from attending them.\r\n\r\nThe bad: Exams. It wasn't so much that the exams were hard, but rather that they were long, that partial credit was incredibly stingy, and that there was no uniform grading system. Some advice for you is to always draw out completely ALL leaving substituents and coproducts, as well as all enzyme residues. I lost a ton of points because I would abbreviate leaving cofactors or coproducts with their names, rather than draw their chemical structures, even though I had already drawn their chemical structures elsewhere in the problem. If I didn't do that, I wouldn't finish the exams and would lose even more points. This would often cause me to lose 1\/4 to 1\/3 of the points on many problems, and these were points lost not for failure to know the mechanism and not because I didn't understand the concepts, but because I wrote the name of a structure that was leaving the reaction instead of drawing it, even though I had drawn it already. That is just absurd and so unfair. On some test questions, points were subtracted for doing things wrong, while on other questions, points were added for getting things right. Sometimes both systems were used simultaneously on the same question. It made it impossible to follow and understand what I needed to do to get full credit on a problem. On the third midterm I lost two points on one part of a question and asked my TF about it. He looked at the answer key and consulted with another TF, and neither of them could figure out why I had lost points. But since we got our exams back halfway through reading week and I still had to finish three papers and a presentation, I didn't have the time to submit a regrade over 2 points. Things like this always gave my friends and me the idea that the teaching staff was trying to steal points away from us, after we had all worked so hard learning and practicing the material. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you are a Chem 17\/27 student, you will resent that there will be a significant number of Chem 20\/30 students who ruin the curve for you. It's unfair that the 17\/27 students should have to compete with the 20\/30 students, who are advanced and have already taken 2 semesters of orgo. On the other hand, it's unfair to 20\/30 students to make them take a third semester of orgo so they can fulfill their pre-med biochem requirement. It's a somewhat broken system that ends up screwing both groups, in different ways.","This class was probably the most difficult class I've taken yet at Harvard.  That does not mean, however, that it is impossible.  It is really straightforward to do well.  There are a lot of ways to practice, and it really helps to do every single practice problem.  The labs in this class are okay, and most of them take under 3 hours.  It's easy to get a 100 on every lab quiz.  A lot of the course may seem very difficult, but just pick out the things from lecture that appear on your psets and on the weekly lecture handouts, and that'll really be the only things you have to learn.  Practice exams are a very good representation of the real exams.  Personally, I was not a huge fan of the material and didn't really understand the point of anything until the last lecture, where they wrap up everything with glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  Still, it's a very different course from Chem 17, much less chemistry concepts driven, and really heavy in mechanisms.  Overall, this is a very well-organized class with a clear method at doing well, however the material is not for all.","only if you have to","It is a lot of work, but very rewarding!","This class is difficult and requires a lot of extra work but it is not impossible. You have to know that you should dedicate time every day to organic chemistry if you want to do well.","it's a very difficult class and requires copious hours of studying to do well","This course is so much better than its reputation! The material is really interesting (mechanism of action of drugs, vitamins, enzymes, etc) and it is not nearly as hard as everyone makes it seem!","Great class! Super organized with a lot of available resources and practice problems. Peer leaders were very helpful","Chem 27 is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. The class is so well-structured with a caring teaching staff and reasonable assignments. In another chem class I took, I felt I was always lost on my own trying to understand the material, and I didn't think that their teaching staff cared about us very much. I came into Chem 27 feeling cynical that the same thing would happen again, but I was proven wrong. The teaching staff in Chem 27 do care about us and devote so much time to help us succeed. I enjoyed coming into lecture every Monday and Wednesday because I found the material fascinating, and I enjoyed section even more because my TF explained things in a fun way and showed that he genuinely wanted us to learn. Working on p-sets with other students was a collaborative process, and there were so many opportunities to come to office hours to ask for help. Additionally, I felt that the class gave us so many resources to work with, from the PSL sections (which were super helpful), to a booklet full of practice problems, practice tests, and handouts.","The material is much more interesting than the material taught in Chem 17. It's hard to believe that Orgo can be enjoyable.","This class is a requirement, so you have no choice. Work with a group on psets.","If you've done chem 20\/30, this class will not be a challenge at all, so you can just focus on learning whatever you want from the class.","At the end of the day, I truly enjoyed this class. The material was interesting, and I found solving problems fun and rewarding. At times, I grew frustrated, especially with what seemed like nit-picky grading. However, this ultimately doesn't really matter. The best way to do well in this class is to do the practice problems, and make sure that you understand the Psets, especially once the answers are out. This will make reviewing for the exams much easier, and they make  up the lion's share of the grade.","Stay on top of the material!! It is managable if you do the practice problems and psets practically and thoughtfully. Less so trying to cram them all in the weekend before the exam. Also, the PSL's are extremely helpful -- so go to them.","Chem 27 is a course that had a lot of promise that unfortunately fell far short of expectations. I took this course as a student who took the Chem 20\/30 sequence beforehand, so I had a different background in the course than many students. Nevertheless, many of the portions of the course that I found frustrating had little to do with my above average level of preparation and while my comments here are largely directed towards students wondering whether to take Chem 27 after Chem 30, I hope that this review is also more generally applicable.  \r\n\r\nThe material in Chem 27 is quite interesting and at times well presented. I learned to look at biochemical reactions in a way that I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t before and learned a fair amount of biochemical logic that I hope to use both in lab and in my future studies. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some cool stuff in there, but unfortunately the overall quality of Prof. Balskus' lectures was dragged down by the poor quality of exams and problem sets as well as by Dr. Spong's lectures.\r\n\r\nMost areas of the course that are administered by Dr. Spong need to see a massive overhaul, starting with the ridiculous grading policies of the course as well as the repetitive, boring assignments and continuing all the way to the abysmal quality of her lectures. I believe that Dr. Spong is truly trying to help the students in the class who may have difficulty with the material by explaining concepts exceedingly slowly and stressing rote memorization as a route to success in this class, but I believe that such attempts were not effective and only served to frustrate most members of the class, including those who she was attempting to help.\r\n\r\nExams and problem sets were absurdly simple in their execution, requiring little time to complete and rarely if ever venturing beyond the material taught in course. There's a great opportunity to learn more on problem sets beyond the material presented in lecture, and this course completely missed that opportunity. Honestly, these assignments were often a total waste of time and only served as an exercise in rote repetition of course policies on how to draw particular mechanisms. \r\n\r\nBoth the emphasis on rote memorization to solve problems and the overall grading policies of this course were ridiculous. The constant insistence to follow particular (often unsaid) course policies in drawing mechanisms was annoying and unnecessarily punitive both to those who understood the material and those who did not. The end result of this course's arbitrary grading policies was a loss of differentiation between those who understood the material and those who did not, which is theoretically the intention behind grading. Two particular facets of the poor grading policies in this course particularly stand out: 1) when a student needs to spend more time studying the course's policies for drawing mechanisms than actually learning the material, or 2) when the only explanation for a supposedly \"incorrect\" mechanism that multiple TFs acknowledge is chemically and biologically sound is that it is different than the key, there is something fundamentally wrong with the pedagogical methodology of the course. Clearly, the course is doable despite these annoyances, and grading policies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t everything, but the pedagogical philosophy expressed by the grading policy is an exemplar of the overall struggles of this course.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am glad that I took Chem 27, but I do believe that the course needs to be (and will be) improved. Prof. Balskus is an interesting lecturer who has a great body of material to draw from, and I certainly learned a lot from the course in its current incarnation. There is a great opportunity here to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-med\u00e2\u20ac\u009d course that can be enjoyed by students from multiple backgrounds and skill levels, but revisions must be made to bring this course up to the high level of quality that I have experienced in other CCB department courses.","This isn't nearly as hard as other people say. I took Chem 20 before this (without Chem 30) and might have a better grasp on organic chemistry, but in all honesty, if you memorize all of your mechanisms, you'll do fine! This class is basically a class on arrow-pushing. Do it well and you're all set!","I would simply say that if you are considering this class as previous 20\/30 student, just don't take it. Otherwise, I would say that it was definitely not my favorite class in the chem department and that I would not have taken it if it had not been a premed requirement.","Balskus was a great addition to this course. A necessary hardship to go through but is one of the better organized and taught science classes I have taken at Harvard.","This class is definitely very doable with the right amount of time and effort! Do the practice problems and use all the resources available to you - it's the best way to learn and to learn efficiently.","This class is neither an organic chemistry class nor a biochemistry class. It has very little in terms of chemical mechanism diversity, and doesn't really cover much of the biochemical pathways that govern life. Instead, 27 resides in this interesting little niche that kind of teaches a bit of both. But hey, it counts for med school, and I guess that's what matters for most of the people taking this class. Chem 20\/30'ers taking this class, be warned that you can't really coast through it without doing the work.","This is an incredible course and I highly recommend it.  I learned a lot about the human body and the mechanistic sense behind bodily functions.","I would tell students who are in the process of being introduced to taking ochem to take this course, but with reservations since some of the course material is gimmicky, tests are annoyingly graded, the professor (Balskus) doesn't teach half the lectures, etc. However, my TF Fred was really helpful.","This course requires a lot of time.  It's important not to fall behind on the work.","This class was quite honestly the best class I've taken in my 2 years at Harvard. I didn't do as well as I would have liked in Chem 17, but when I entered Chem 27 I felt empowered by the passion and support I felt from the Chem 27 staff. Absolutely every single person in the course was invested in my success and understanding of organic chemistry and its broader implications on real world problems. Office hours, whether with TFs, PSLs, Dr. Spong or Professor Balskus were fantastic because they gave advice and tips for tackling problems that seemed impossible at first sight. In this course, I believe if you have the desire to succeed and the will to work hard, you will go incredibly far. Please take advantage of the fantastic resources provided for you. Delve into the course with confidence in your ability to do well because the entire Chem 27 staff is there to support you. Best of luck! =)","Be sure to regularly work on problems in your yellow practice book so when exam time comes, you won't be rushing to do 70+ problems 2 nights before.","This class is intellectually stimulating. Lectures, Problem Sets and Practice Problems are all related, unlike some science classes. However, the lab component-while not too difficult-is unnecessarily dry. So boring and dull. This class isn't Chemistry 17, but Professor Balskus and Dr. Spong do a good job with the material they have to work with. If you thinking about taking it, go for it.","This course was extremely enjoyable.  The teaching staff was so helpful and so clear in their instruction that it was easy to learn.  If you do all the work and put some effort into studying every week there is no reason you wont do great.  Don't be afraid it will be fine and for me it was easier than Chemistry 17!","Biochemistry is miraculous.  If you're willing to work hard, you'll learn some of the most elegant chemistry known to science.","This class is a lot better than chem 17. It applies the concepts you learned in chem 17 to a biological context, so if you are interested in physiology, this class would be more appealing than the chem 20\/30 series. Also, the class isn't that difficult if you put time into learning the mechanisms.","Do all the practice questions in a timely manner","If you are interested in biology and are planning to take organic chemistry, I recommend that you take Chem 17\/27 over Chem 20\/30. The content of Chem 27 is quite a bit more interesting than that of Chem 17 (or Chem 20\/30, I imagine), but the course is also much more difficult. Grading is sometimes harsh and arbitrary, and sympathy is hard to come by in such a large, competitive course. That said, the material is really cool, and I'm leaving with a much stronger understanding of organic chemistry, both in general and in a biological context.","It covers interesting material, but the grading policy and slow lectures are definitely reasons to avoid the course.","Most of the staff members of the course were helpful and pretty nice. However, I did not care for the way that the course was pretty much just biochemistry as I felt that it was not advertised this way. To be honest, I wish I had taken Chem 20\/30 because even though (from what I hear) the material is more complicated, I get the impression that expectations are more straightforward.","The material that you learn is interesting but the way you learn it is not.","This class requires lots of time and hard work but is extremely rewarding and pretty fun at times.  If you can devote the time and are interested in the sciences, I would recommend this class.","This is a very organized course. Lectures are clear, mechanisms are not complex, and exams are straightforward. If you are premed and have taken Chem 20\/30, this is a great way to get rid of your biochem requirement, especially considering you don't have to do the labs.\r\n\r\nThe exam material was very reflective of the practice materials and the problem sets. Nothing was ever unexpected; but there is certainly a fair amount of material.","Stay on top of your work and do psets early!","Take it if you have to","Be prepared to work hard! Reach out to the teaching staff; they are incredibly supportive and enthusiastic.","It's not too difficult but there is a lot of work involved.","I came into this class after taking much harder chem classes...let's just say that I'd only recommend Chem 27 with reservations. The grading is whack - chemistry isn't the real focus of this course, pandering to premeds is.","If you're interested in chemical reactions occurring in the body and understanding how drugs work, this is definitely the class for you. I think Chem 27 can be as bad or good as what you put into it. You do cool stuff in labs, so embrace that and be excited! The psets often aren't bad, and section is really helpful. Do the practice problems, and the midterms will be easier.","This material should be interesting, but it's taught in a way that's static, boring, frustrating; neither challenging nor engaging. The chemistry itself is not complicated, and yet many lectures spend an hour and a half going through every step of a mechanism in painstaking detail, when five minutes would be sufficient to understand it. The grading policy is quite rigid, and de-emphasizes understanding, synthesis and application of concepts in favor of rote memorization of mechanisms (somewhat challenging to avoid, I suppose, given the given the nature of the material). All in all I found this class rather disappointing.","It's as difficult as advertised: be prepared to invest a lot of time at office hours, studying on your own, and going to lab. It will be hard to do very well due to the crazy pre-med competition. It is a requirement for most of you, so there really isn't much you can do to get out of this one haha. Put in the work!","This class is an interesting application of the principles of organic chem to the life sciences.","This class is manageable if you are prepared to study and practice chemistry a lot. Take Chem 20\/30 if you are interested in learning the actual reasons why the chemistry happens. This class is simply memorizing reactions.","Get ready for a lot of work.","Be sure to dedicate the necessary time to this course! The material actually isn't impossibly hard. As long as you pay attention in lecture, go to section, and do the psets (all of which you have to do anyways, you should be just fine). The hardest parts about this course are the amount of material you have to absorb, the amount of time it takes out of your schedule (lab+class+section=9 hours\/week...and that's without time for doing the pre-lab assignments and psets), and the grading. Be anal about getting everything right in your psets and your practice problems! In this class, you can know all of the material and still perform poorly on exams because of small errors. Best of luck!","Chem 27 shows you how all the reactions and mechanisms from Chem 17 are biologically relevant.  I loved how the course connected these concepts to nature's catalysts - enzymes - and also taught us about the design of drugs\/inhibitors.","Honestly if you are considering taking orgo here or during the summer, take the second semester somewhere else. This class requires an insane amount of practice in order to be able to spit the stuff out fast enough on an exam. The material is interesting but the problems are not. Make sure you take this class seriously from the beginning and practice all the time. Plan a balance schedule. This class lowered my quality of life this semester.","Put in the work through practice problems, review materials, lecture attendance, and it pays off well. Also, go to office hours with Dr. Spong--she is so helpful and very methodical in her teaching.","Don't get behind on the material very early. The course overall requires a lot of your time but can be manageable. Interesting material.","Take this if you need biochem, but don't underestimate the amount of time that you'll need to spend on this class.","Take advantage to all of the resources provided to assist with our understanding of the material. Office hours are very helpful after you attempt all of the problems on the psets.","This course is amazing! The course is not the easiest in the world, and you have to be willing to really sit down and learn the material, but it is such an awesome class! Professor Balskus is amazing, and the material is so interesting!","This course presents interesting information, is well organized, and is fairly well taught. However, it definitely requires lots of time and effort to really master the material. If you don't practice, you won't do well. Take it from someone who made the same mistake.","Everything builds on itself in the course, so if you are struggling with a specific area, get help immediately.","Having come from Chem 20\/30, this course was made significantly more manageable because Chem 20\/30 trains you so well. Additionally, not having the lab component saved many hours per week. This course emphasizes mechanisms and inhibitors, with little focus on synthesis, which is okay. It teaches the fundamentals of biochemistry--important cofactors, and amino acids essential to any scientist interested in the field. Learning how to analyze pymol files is also nice. An upper level biochemistry course could probably cover the entire class in two-four weeks though, so if you've already taken organic chemistry, it may be better worth your time to take an upper level course. One last note--if you've already taken chem 20\/30, the concepts will likely be relatively easy to grasp. However, this course grades more strictly (e.g. when you propose a mechanism, if you miss small details and intermediates), you will lose points. Fortunately, the teaching staff is pretty phenomenal and reliable--Professor Balskus is truly interested and engaged in the material, and TFs are friendly. Overall, a useful learning experience, but if you desire academic enrichment in biochemistry rather than fulfilling another pre-med requirement, look for Chem170\/171!","Go over the answer keys to psets v carefully to pick out what details they want w mechanisms.","You probably don't have a choice, so don't waste your time reading these comments. Take the course because you have to and just make sure you like your other classes. The lectures are terrible and won't ever teach you anything. Give your clicker to a friend and just go ahead and learn on your own. The problem sets will come nowhere close to preparing you for the tests, and regardless of how hard you study, the teaching staff tries their hardest to make sure you get the least amount of points possible anyway.  Good luck, hopefully they'll change the professor and structure of the course for when you have to take it.","You're really only 'prepared' for an exam when you've done the two practice tests and ALL of the practice problems for that segment of the course. And by prepared, I mean scoring somewhere within ten points of the average. Plan accordingly. Also, take extensive notes on each lecture as they happen. This will save a significant amount of time when reviewing.","Spong and Balskus are both incredibly painful lecturers, furthermore, take note that this class is EXTREMELY different from chem17 so even if you excelled in that class don't expect that this class will be similar, its way harder because it involves biological applications you learned in 17, what this means is that memorizing the mechanisms isn't enough to get a good grade in this class, you will literally have to do every single practice problem in the yellow book because every single question on the exam is completely novel and will claim to be \"similar to yellow book problem x\" ... an extremely difficult class that requires an extremely large amount of time to do well, i didn't put the time in and my grades definitely suffered, also take note that exams are NOT curved like in 17","Take it seriously, and dont just go through the motions (pset, labs, lectures), but try and appreciate what you are learning. You'll do better that way. Also, attend lecture!","Chem 17 definitely was far better than this course. I suggest you do ALL the practice problems in the yellow book, because they don't hold anything back during the exams.","It demands a great deal of work - but in the end it's really amazing to learn about different cofactors and their responsibilities in the human body.","As long as you diligently do the practice problems and practice exams, you will be well prepared for anything they throw at you on a midterm\/final.","Start doing practice problems from the start. That way, you can work out strategies to tackle similar problems when the midterms finally roll around.","I found that even though I did every single practice problem and every practice exam, I really did not improve.  It was frustrating.  However, Professor Balskus is amazing.","Chem 27 is a sad excuse for a Harvard class. It might be good if you're a not very intellectually blessed premed, but other than that, don't take it. Prof. Balskus is awesome, and some of the TFs are helpful, but that's about the only good thing about the class. Be prepared for nitpicking grading that doesn't take into account your understanding of the material, a class structure that emphasizes memorization over learning, classmates that cause you to constantly wonder how they got in to Harvard, and a teaching staff that is often insufferable (peer student leaders and undergrad TFs) or has had any love of chemistry beaten out of them by generations of premeds (Dr. Spong).","It was hard, but doable.","Do not take this course. It will be the most pseudo-intellectual and frustrating experience of your life. This was by far the worst course I have taken at Harvard -- and that includes all of the major, commonly-disliked premed classes.","Be prepared to put in a lot of time for this course outside of lecture and section. It is also important that you're willing to take advantage of office hours that are not your personal TF's and to get to know the peer leaders. The outside resources for the course will help you A LOT.","only take this class if you have to. It was miserable and I hated it. No matter how much work I put into it, I never got better than 2 SD below the mean.","Make sure the rest of your schedule is light because chem 27 takes a lot of time. It is helpful to form a study group early on for problem sets. Always do the redo problem! Don't read the lecture pre-notes, they're not that helpful.","Hard but you can do it if you keep up with the work!  You can't cram...","The topics discussed in this course are so interesting and by the end, you will be amazed that you understand the way that your body generates energy. But the structure for the course is terrible. You're graded not for knowledge, but for flair and speed. Don't dare ask \"why\" something happens, because both the TFs and the preceptors will likely respond with, \"It's just what happens in the enzyme.\" The sense of logic that comes from Chem 20\/30 is not to be found here.","This class is a great application of organic chemistry to biology and medicine.  Very nice course to have when med schools are switching their requirements to \"biochem.\"","Stay on top of the practice problems and do not be afraid of asking for help. The teaching staff is fantastic and always there for you. You'll learn a lot of interesting material, but it isn't easy.","If you like chemistry and if you're interested in biology -and- you need to fulfill a requirement, take this class. It definitely takes work, but I also highly recommend it over Chem 17. It's taught very well, and if you put in the time, success is certainly possible.","Depends on brute memorization instead of understanding or creative thinking.","I can see the appeal of this class if you really like chemistry and want to see how it works in nature (in enzymes, with co-factors, no strong acids or bases, etc.) but really I'm assuming you're in this class because you have to, because that's the story of a majority of us. Do practice problems and try to keep up with the material. Know your amino acids! The handouts on the website are very helpful. Look at those before anything else. I also kept a separate part of my notebook and put all the important mechanisms there, and that was helpful to not have to look through 50 million lecture slides to find one.","If you want a biological application and a taste of the chemistry in biological transformations, this class is perfect to give you a sense of biochem too.","This was the worst course I've taken at Harvard. Poorly administrated, poorly taught, and a waste of my time. Take Chem 20\/30 instead - a bit harder, but you won't be arbitrarily punished and you might actually learn something.","Make sure you understand and remember the material from CHEM 17. It'll be hard if you're not a chem major because a lot of chem concentrators take this course their junior or senior year and they'll have a lot more background information to work with than you. Stay on top of things!","Get used to doing a lot of practice problems right away. I realized this too late and as a result did not do so well on the first two exams. Also, reach out to the teaching staff. Getting their advice on study strategies and strategies for problems will make an immense difference in how difficult you find the class.","This class is extremely interesting and I found the material much easier to learn and to study than Chem 17, however, it is difficult and requires a lot of hard work.","It is necessary if you're pre-med but beware, it is extremely difficult... Never have I struggled so much with a class. I absolutely loved Chem 17 and Professor Jacobsen. Coming into Chem 27, I expected to have a similar experience and was shocked by how different it was. I love chemistry, but I put in all the effort possible and barely scraped by. If you decide to enroll, be aware, from the beginning, that this course is a full schedule all on its own.","This is a hard class. Expect to put a lot of time into it! It is, however, very rewarding. I thought that the material is awesome and I learned so much.","Extremely well organized and very easy to do well if you put in the time and effort (which, unlike many people make it out to be, is not actually much more than any other science class). The entire teaching staff is ready to help you do well. The grading occasionally focuses too much on formalism, but you can avoid frustration if you learn this formalism early on and you are careful with your answers on homework\/tests.","This class requires practice and work in order to do well. You will already know the chemistry from chem 17 or 20\/30. The difficult aspect of this course is the sheer amount of stuff you'll need to memorize, such as how certain proteases work or how PLP functions. It is definitely doable to get an A for the class, but in order to do so you need to exhaust all available resources as a way of getting exposed to many different types of questions.","Make outlines of the lecture notes. That will help the best. Write out reaction mechanisms a million times. This class is all about memorization and not about concept understanding. Think of it as a bio class. It is very different from Chem 17! May even take more time than 17!","Chem 27 is a FANTASTIC course. The lecture material is very interesting, and the course is very well structured. Professor Balskus and Dr. Spong are both very effective lecturers, and they both really want you to enjoy the course and do well in it. There are also tons of resources available for you to ensure that you do well in the course (such as Office Hours and PSL study sessions). The course doesn't teach you just pure organic chemistry reaction mechanisms - it applies reaction mechanisms introduced in Chem 17 to several different biological processes and concepts (specifically glycolysis and the citric acid cycle), making this course a lot of fun to study for. My tip for doing well in this course - try to do a little bit of Chem 27 every day instead of procrastinating until the night before the exam. Cramming for exams the night before does NOT work, especially for organic chemistry courses. Trust me, I have tried this once before and failed miserably (it doesn't matter how many red bulls or 5-hour energy shots you drink - you will fail miserably). If you do a little bit of Chem 27 every day, you will do well and enjoy the course. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course!! Good luck to all of you premeds taking this course!","Chem 27 was among the least inspiring courses of my time at Harvard. I have never before worked so hard mastering subject material I could not find interesting, only to be so unrewarded in the end. There are so many issues with the way this class was taught, but one of the biggest was that Chem 20\/30, and even 40 kids took the class as an easy A, ruined section by answering all the questions, and killed the exam mean. It's not fair to be competing with chemistry concentrators in a class designed for pre-med biology concentrators. Worst class I've ever taken.","Keep up with the practice problems!","Do it if you have to. It doesn't have to be a miserable experience, but it does require a huge amount of work, and a commitment to internalize some challenging concepts.","If you are taking this course, most likely it is because you have to for a pre-med requirement. It is better than chem 17 but still painful. Do the practice problems.","Chem 27 was much more difficult for me than 17 as it focused much more on who could memorize the most than who understood underlying concepts.  To make matters worse the class is filled with students who are chemistry concentrators who are looking for an easy grade at the expense of making the curve hell for all the premeds who aren't as Orgo savvy.  Organic chemistry is seen as the hardest premed subjects at most schools and therefor focus is on helping students pass with the required information.  At Harvard the classes (name 17\/27 20\/30) go far beyond this and punish students who want to learn what is necessarily and move on to topics they find more interesting - a big part of this problem is not separating this class from the chemistry concentration or students who took 20\/30 and want an easy grade that still looks good on a resume.","This class must be your number one priority, and it will beat you down. get a tutor immediately, be diligent about putting in your charges, electrons etc, everything will get points off. this class was so frustrating, and i just feel relief that it is over.","Take this class!!\r\nThe teaching staff are tremendously supportive, and the class material is wonderfully organized to give you a great introduction to chemical biology pathways in the body. I have enjoyed learning organic chemistry this past year, and I hope you will also put in the effort to get out of it a rewarding experience.","If you put in the work, this class is entirely manageable.  Do every single practice problem in the yellow book.","It is important to go into the course with a positive attitude and be prepared to work hard.","One of the few premed requirements that I enjoyed. I actually came to really miss orgo by the time I finished the final. Fantastic, all-star teaching staff make it an enjoyable experience."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Its much easier than Chem 17, since it is applying the concepts learned.","This course took up a ton of my time, and was definitely stressful at times. However, in the end, it all came together in a really cool way and I couldn't help but be excited about all of the cool and biologically relevant chemistry I had learned. Enjoying this course is all about having a good attitude and not letting the experience feel like SUCH high stakes. The PSLs are really excellent, and I truly think you can do well in this course without driving yourself completely insane.","This course makes you appreciate how well-taught and organized Chem 17 is. Overall, Chem 27 is a good course, but it doesn't compare to chem 17. The lecture slides are really convoluted and the mechanisms are never just written out simply. Balskus gives pretty good lectures, but Spong's lectures are really hard to watch unless you're watching them on 2 or 3x speed. There are no section handouts, which is one of the best components of chem 17, but section is still pretty helpful.","This is a tough class, but I think it's possible to be on top of the coursework if the material is fully used. Definitely do the practice problems, they will save you. But overall, it is a good course with good information. It is hard, but possible.","This class, for me, was significantly harder than Chem 17 and less interesting. If I had to do it all over again, I would have reviewed the material more regularly and started studying earlier for the exams. You will need at least 20 hours to study for each exam.","If you have to take organic chemistry, this is a difficult but manageable way to do it.  The class is well-organized by very talented teaching staff who provide you with everything you need to do well, as long as you are able to put a LOT of time into the class.  It would very tough to take this course along with other heavy ones.  By the end of the semester, however, you have learned a huge amount of chemistry that actually is applicable sometimes if you are a premed.","If you have a good TF, Chem27 can be a semi-enjoyable experience. Do all of the practice problems and go to the PSLs. The material covered in them is invaluable. They are akin to Professor Jacobsen's Friday problem solving sessions from Chem17.","Better than chem 17 but the exams are so hard that it's still awful and frustrating.","Do the practice problems. Study more than you did in Chem 17. The tests are harder than Chem 17 tests.","This class teaches you how to think, they don't spoon feed you, but they dont throw you in the deep end either. But you have to think, put in the work","If you are pre-med or Life Sciences you have to take it.  I'm sure it's better than chem 20\/30 but it still stinks a lot.  The psets aren't very hard, but this is deceiving because the tests are super hard.  Even if you study a lot and do all the practice problems and think the practice tests are fine, the tests are still brutal.  Low averages and not good curves as well.  Go to all of the PSL sections and office hours (they are super helpful)!  The course staff really wants to help so take advantage of this.  Don't expect to get a good grade unless you commit a LOT of hours every week to just doing extra studying and extra practice problems (which seems unnecessary because the psets are deceivingly easy).","This is a difficult course, but you have all the resources to succeed if you choose to seek them out and use them.  I recommend attending the PSL sessions and Dr. Spong's office hours.  Don't leave yourself to struggle through the course on your own, or else it will not be enjoyable.  I actually found it to be quite collaborative and enjoyable.","You will hear many bad things about this class because the majority of students who take it are pre-meds and they care only about their final grade. If you want to enjoy this class, try to appreciate the beauty of Biochem and it will be one of your best classes at Harvard. Highly recommended.","This is a very well taught and fairly interesting class. However, it is extremely time intensive and one of the harder classes I have ever taken.","this class is ridiculously challenging, but so incredibly rewarding. The time you spend on the material will pay off when it comes to studying for the final. get ready to werk! There is so much help to guide you along the way.","This class was a great course, with lots of resources available. There was very interesting biology application also. It is fairly difficult though, and you have to put in a lot of hours to do well in it. Take advantages of the PSL sessions!","This class is likely a pre-med requirement for you, so I guess you have to take it.  Make sure to take advantage of all of the resources they offer: office hours, PSLs, maybe a tutor.  Stay on top of your work.  I found this class really difficult, but probably could have done a better job getting outside help.","What to say about Chem 27? It's better than Chem17. Or maybe you'll just be better at Orgo. Try to do all the practice problems. Don't forget to draw leaving groups or other obvious things. Attention to detail is key. Just try.","Chem 27 is a hugely informative and exciting course! It reinforced how satisfied I am with my decision to concentrate in Chemistry. The course combines an integrative approach to chemistry, biology, and medicine. Chem 27 is a very challenging class. The course staff is the best and always willing to help! However, you must be ready to put in the necessary work and do not fall behind. Go to as many review sessions, PSL sessions, and office hours as you can!","Chem27 takes time. It's a commitment, but if you plan your schedule accordingly and put in the work required it can be rewarding and cool. It's a great feeling when you solve a problem. I'd highly recommend taking advantage of ALL the resources they offer. There are so many, and they're extremely crucial to doing well in the course: lab office hours (didn't discover these till late in the semester, but they're GREAT), GO TO PSL SECTIONS, and DO PRACTICE PROBLEMS like there's no tomorrow. Practice, practice, practice, and then practice some more. Pre-lecture notes aren't necessary. Study lectures, handouts online, and do problems. There's no substitute for practicing the problems.","I was really nervous about taking orgo, but it ended up being a really great class. I learned a lot and felt the work was very manageable. Don't be scared :)","You have to take this class if you want to go to med school, so recommendations aren't really relevant here.","If you have taken Chem 20\/30, do not take this course. The material is new and you'll definitely learn new mechanisms about how the human body handles this chemistry, but it's not that exciting of a class. There is absolutely no focus on learning or understanding concepts. Most of the teaching staff doesn't even know or bother to explain why things actually happen. The real focus of the class is reproducibility and testing whether you can memorize mechanisms exactly as they're done in lecture (and I mean EXACTLY, down to every deprotonation). \r\n\r\nThe class is not particularly challenging, and you'll learn some, but it's definitely frustrating. I'm sure there's a better class you can take to fulfill your biochem requirement!","This class can be very interested but you may not see that right away. My TF gave me great advice while I was studying, he said that it is wise to know the chemistry and not just the mechanism. I had been content with knowing only the mechanism but by applying what you learned in Cem 17 (where it is applicable) it save a lot of thought and time. \r\n\r\nIf you can avoid it DONT BUT THE COURSE BOOKS! Only buy the practice problem book and lab book. You can get all the slides on PDFs and it is far better that you shorten the notes yourself rather than just copying what the professor writes on the board. Do well on the midterms because they are actually not that bad at all but learn how the exams are graded and pay attention to details.","This class is awful. Seriously, don't take it.... Orgo is difficult enough, but combining it with biochemistry is even worse. The material is extremely difficult, lectures are confusing, and the only time when you actually learn is section and the PSL sections (which are awesome). I've never hated a class more than this one.","The class is difficult. Plain and simple. You'll learn a lot, but I definitely felt that my knowledge was not at all reflected in my grade. I was consistently at office hours, PSL (shoutout to Kevin Bu and Riley -- I would not have survived without them), did well on the psets (which you MUST check with many people), studied hours on hours for the exams, aced all of the lab quizzes, but just didn't do well on midterms. It's tough but you gotta do what you gotta to get to med school.","Great Class. I really appreciated how the chemistry you learn from other courses is applied in a biological context.","This is a fantastic course. Ignore what everyone says about organic chemistry! This course is an absolute gem but you do NEED to work hard in the course. Keep up with materials, go to PSL sections (oops, didn't do that), and go through the practice problems as you go through the material. Read the background notes and review the notes from the lectures each week. It is definitely a worthwhile course, but it will make you work for it.","I don't think you really have a choice if you need your pre-med requirement.  It's a nicely organized class and labs aren't as ridiculous as people made them out to be.","Although organic chemistry tends to get a bad reputation, this class is really not as bad as everyone says it is. There are so many resources available to students, so that if you are falling behind in the class, it is your own fault for not reaching out. I especially found going to the PSL sections helpful and would definitely recommend taking advantage of them. You also learn some of the most important chemical pathways in the body, especially cellular respiration, which is pretty cool.","Take it if you have to.","Be careful, there is too many Pre-meds in this class. Thus, the class is miserable!","This class is exactly what you have heard about it --- an incredible amount of work constantly, but you learn a ton and will feel very supported the whole way through if you take advantage of all the resources (TF Office Hours, PSLs, weekend help sessions, practice problems, etc)","You probably don't have much to think about if you're debating whether to take this class or not -- if it's a requirement, buckle up and get ready for the ride! Take advantage of the numerous Peer Student Leader sections as well as the office hours. The support system is there if you seek it.","Balskus is great and all the TFs are great. There are so many resources for help that is almost overwhelming, but it's ultimately on you to do well. Faculty really does everything they can.","This course is a lot different than Chem 17. The material is a little less intuitive and it really covers both biology and chemistry.","Chem 27 is a very challenging class that is also very rewarding if you put enough time into studying the mechanisms and drilling practice problems. I found the connections to biological pathways interesting and useful for providing context for the mechanisms we learned. I enjoyed Chem 27 more than Chem 17 because of this and also because I thought the course was well-taught, though less well-organized than Chem 17.","This class takes time--invest in practice problems, psets, and Office Hours and you'll be just fine.","The class is hard. Organic chemistry is something that some people get and others don't. However, in terms of how the course was taught, I have no regrets. There were enough sections, PSLs, office hours, etc. where I could ask questions. \r\n\r\nDO ALL of the PRACTICE PROBLEMS and if possible, go to the PSLs. If you have ANY questions, ASK THEM. \r\n\r\nAlso, treat organic chemistry like it's a language class. It requires practice and maybe some intuition, but MOSTLY PRACTICE.","This course was really great. I learned a lot about how chemical processes in the body occur and I became more able to explain them. The teaching staff is very approachable and available and they are really willing to help you do well, and I highly recommend office hours.","This is a well-taught class with relatively light workload for a second-semester orgo class. However, you won't feel like you're learning orgo. Instead, it will be more like a biochem class. You won't be learning how to use tools in a chem toolkit to solve mechanisms. You will be memorizing mechanisms to regurgitate them on the test. And there will be a TON of mechanisms to memorize. Also, don't bother with buying the coursepacks as the teach staff does a great job of posting lecture slides online.","While it was no doubt the hardest class I've taken yet at Harvard, I thoroughly enjoyed learning the material. The teaching staff is excellent and is very good at making sure that you have help if you have questions or are starting to struggle.","It's very memorization heavy, and there's definitely less emphasis on creativity than in chem 20. However, there are tons of resources. Use the PSLs early on!!","A really great introduction to biochemistry; if you're interested in how drugs work, you'll get a really solid introduction in this course.","Practice, and you will do fine in the course. The number of midterms is staggering, but they will help keep you on pace for the final exam.","This is the best chemistry class that I've ever taken at Harvard.","As someone who really enjoyed Chem 17, this class was a disappointment.  If you love learning biology and the steps of biochemical mechanisms then you might find this class interesting.  I was constantly frustrated by not actually understanding why something was happening at a chemical level.  The class was also needlessly picky about the strangest of things so PAY attention to all the little things-- they will likely get you more marks than actually knowing a mechanism. \r\nIf you are yet to take orgo, still have the opportunity to take 20\/30, you enjoy logic problems and understanding chemistry then TAKE 20\/30 instead! Even if it is more painful, based on what my friends say, you will get a lot more out of it!","This is a great continuation of Jacobsen's awesome teaching.  Balskus and Spong really enjoy and understand the material.","Organic chemistry is a universal pain, BUT if you must take it, this class is the best way to do it. The course is incredibly organized, and they offer a wealth of resources and support. The topics are really interesting since many of them have medical implications, and even if you don't like them, the class will help you to appreciate them. The class will require a lot of you time, but if you put in the time, you can definitely do well and learn a lot.","Rumors that chem 27 is easier than chem 17 are definitely false--I spent way more time on chem 27 and did not do nearly as well on exams. Definitely do all of the practice problems--multiple times--and make sure you understand why each problem is completed the way it is, not just how to do it. Understand a concept and figure out how to apply it in a novel way, and have the pathways down cold before taking exams. Office hours are fabulous, and make sure that you utilize them to get full points on problem sets (turn in the redo q every time!) to boost your grade, since the class isn't curved.","Any course following Chem 17 in a sequence has huge, un-fillable shoes to fill. Chem 27 comes pretty close. The course is extremely well organized, and the material is relevant to biology and the biochemistry component of the course is extremely fascinating. As a result of this course, I look up the mechanism of action of any antibiotic I take, etc.--this class managed to open up the field of medicinal chemistry as a career possibility for me. I am grateful for the strong biochem component of the course--it brought organic chemistry to life.","This course is not as well designed as Chem 17. The labs are irrelevant and very time intensive, both in preparation and in actual lab time. As much as I loved Chem 17, I think that summer orgo may be less painful than the Chem 17-Chem 27 track. If you do take this course, prepare yourself to really dedicate yourself and to put in a great deal of time.","This a hard course, and if you're considering taking it that probably means that you're a premed student who has to. I much preferred Chem 17. Stay on top of your work, and go to PSLs. Identify the most important takeaways from each lecture and study those well.","Be prepared to do a lot of work with psets and studying for the exams. Though you may feel tempted to cram the material all towards the end, the best way to tackle this class is by consistently doing the practice problems every week and making time to go to psl, they are so helpful! (Shout out to Olive!)","How you do in this class depends entirely on how much work you put into it. If you work your butt off you can do really well. So do every single practice problem, especially those leading up to a midterm.","This is a really great course! There are a lot of resources to help you, so take advantage of them! Do or read the answers to all of the practice problems, go to as many PSL sessions as you can, attend office hours to confirm pset answers you're unsure about... I also HIGHLY recommend getting a BSC tutor from the very beginning before you get lost or confused. With only one hour a week of tutoring, I stayed on top of the material throughout this course and never felt overwhelmed. I really enjoyed biochemistry and this class!","This course is incredibly interesting, but, as is typical of all of these pre-med weed-out classes, students don't really have the opportunity to appreciate the material of the course because everyone is too preoccupied with grades.  Exam questions are of much greater difficulty than problem sets, which were quite basic.  Practice problems are far more useful in learning how to do problems.  The main problem, though, is that exam questions often require a significant amount of deep thinking (and an absurd amount of drawing extensive chemical structures).  The problem is that exams also require students to be able to do a problem correctly immediately upon seeing it without really thinking.  This strategy is not designed to really gauge how well you understand a topic; if that were the case, grades would be based on challenging problems sets, and there wouldn't be any concern about the distribution of grades.  But this is a pre-med class, so the point of exams is to an incredibly small cadre of students to get high grades.  Of course, if you are considering Chem 27, this phenomenon shouldn't be new to you: such is the life of pre-meds at Harvard.  \r\n\r\nProf. Balskus is a wonderful instructor, and a lot of effort is clearly preparing this course.  Some of the labs are rather interesting, and don't let the 5-hour time slot every week scare you off.  (Labs are intense, but not terribly high-stakes.)  \r\n\r\nMy advice to future Chem 27 students would be to try to focus not on the grades (since the grade cut-offs provide some leeway) but rather on the fascinating chemistry and biochemical processes that are taught in the class.","If you are pre med this is a great option. Knock out orgo and biochem at the same time. Fair class. Just a ton of work but that is the nature of organic chemistry","Prof. Balskus is a gem, and gives really great and engaging lectures. Spong, not so much. All in all, the material covered in this course is actually pretty interesting, if you actually pay attention rather than just trying to memorize everything you need to memorize and not thinking about it on a deeper level. Overall, it's a decent class, though probably not one to take unless you actually have to.","I mean there's no reason to take the class unless you're premed","Be prepared for ridiculous grading but interesting material.","This class is quite challenging and there are some frustrating elements to it. However, if you enjoyed 17, you are likely to enjoy this course for the most part as well.","Be prepared to put in a lot of time when preparing for exams. This course is practice, practice, practice. As long as you do all the problems in the practice booklet and review the lecture slides thoroughly, you should be able to do well. The materials could be dry sometimes, but this course will definitely broaden your view on biochemical metabolism and drug development.","If you have a lot of time to put into this class, then you have potential to do well. If not, then you better hope you are a genius","To do well in this class you have to do a lot of practice problems. Even though the book of problems may seem daunting, work through them as much as possible, especially before exams, because doing the practice problems is the most useful way to study. Prepare to put a lot of time into the class, and go to PSL sessions if possible because they are very helpful reviews of the material. If you put enough time and energy into this class to understand the material, then you will actually be able to enjoy the topics covered in Chem 27, which are all pretty interesting.","LEARN ORGO BEFORE TAKING THIS CLASS. It's so hard. I spent a whole year on it and left feeling like I haven't learned anything. Brace yourself and ask for more help than you think you'll need.","Chem 27 is definitely a step up from Chem 17, so be prepared for that! That being said, the course material is naturally more interesting, since it is motivated by biological phenomena, so it is easier to engage the material in this course compared to Chem 17 for most. However, the lectures can still be drier than Jacobsen's lectures, so it is a mixed bag. Whatever you do, stay on top of the practice problems. They will certainly help you on the exam if you have had multiple times to go over them before you get to the exam. Keep studying hard, even if you don't do well on the first few midterms, because there is a lot of room for improvement in this class.","Great class. Challenging but great","Take this class if you have to. It's not as bad of a class as you might think. But don't take it as an elective if you don't have to.","Take this course only if you have to fulfill a pre-med requirement or concentration requirement. It is not taught as well as it could be and the exams have some questions that will make you raise eyebrows because they are trying to trick you. Practice problems are unnecessarily difficult and do not accurately represent questions on an exam or problem sets. The sections are kind of useless, because you go over three problems in the span of an hour. Be prepared to learn most of the material by yourself through doing problem sets and sitting down and reading through the lecture notes that are written at a high academic level as if you already knew the chemical terms.","It's hard to make organic chemistry enjoyable, but Chem 27 does! The team does a great job and is very approachable.","For the non-premeds: I surprisingly loved this class. Yes, the stress surrounding this class due to the heavy pre-med population is definitely present, but I still found the material to be really engaging. Balskus did an amazing job making the material relevant, in that we were learning about real reactions and mechanisms of real drugs and inhibitors. I learned a lot of chemistry from this class and have come away with an appreciation for it. I don't know who will be teaching it next year, but Balskus did a great job.","Be prepared to dedicate time and not do well.","It's a tough course, no doubt about it. Pace yourself, do the practice problems multiple times and do timed practice exams before each midterm and the final.","Interesting, tremendous amount of work, do every practice problem.","You learn a lot, but the instructors assume this is your first priority and if you don't put in that amount of time, you won't do well.","A great class and fascinating but be prepared for a lot of work and a real commitment to understanding the material.","Do the practice problems and attend the PSL office hours.","A great, well-taught and interesting course that satisfies both the biochemical and organic chemistry pre-medical requirement!  I strongly recommend this course for any pre-med students who have taken Chem 20 and\/or 30.  I did not do well in Chem 20 but I felt absolutely fine in this course (much easier).  If you took both 20 and 30 then this course should be an absolute breeze.  Do not spend over $100 buying the course packets on your own!!!  Find a group of people taking the course and just have one person buy it, split the money amongst the group, and photocopy the pages.  In my experience, the blue book with lectures really is not necessary, but the yellow book of practice problems is extremely useful!","After Chem 17, this class is a great follow-up because you can learn a lot of ways that the organic chemistry we've learned about is directly applied in our bodies and in the world around us. The labs are also interesting, and most of them don't take a full 5 hours.","Definitely go to the PSL sections if you can, they're pretty much the most helpful aspect of the class and the PSLs this year were amazing. Unlike Chem 17, where the lectures are very specific as to what information one is required to know for the exam, discerning what information is important is much more difficult in Chem 27 and the lectures in general aren't as well organized, so make sure to ask early if you have any questions and look at the handouts on the website. On the positive side, the labs rarely (if ever) take the full five hours.","Good class! :) Not too stressful and pretty fair! Very interesting material too!","Yes, you have to take organic chemistry if you are a pre-medical student; no, it isn't always fun. Accordingly, this class isn't fun. But you will learn to pay a lot of attention to detail (whether or not you care about the right ion being in the right place) and you will bond with your fellow students over the somewhat ridiculous number of hours this class requires from you every week. Go to the PSL sections because they aren't really \"optional\" - there is class material available there you can't get anywhere else. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the teaching staff are generally very nice and helpful, and it will be to your benefit to get to know them.","Take it if you need it as pre-med requirement. Otherwise it's not really worth it.","professor balskus does a good job of clearly explaining the lecture topics, but the course could do better in terms of its organization with TFs","The material taught in Chem 27 is incredibly important for any student going into the biological or biomedical sciences. You will come out with, at the very least, an appreciation that enzymes are not just black boxes in research problems but rather very highly tuned machines that can be broken, jammed, and even fundamentally altered to cause disease- or even prevent it. However, passion for this topic is maybe 10% of the requirement for this class, at most. The nature of the class demands that the majority of your academic time allotment for the spring semester is spent working problems and understanding concepts. I personally was left questioning how 'well-rounded' my semester ended up being, with most of my time spent on chemistry, but was nonetheless very proud of my resulting knowledge of fundamental biological processes on the chemical level, something that sounds incredibly nerdy but is a sad truth.","Most people take this because they have to for pre-med or concentration requirements.  The teaching isn't stellar, certainly not Jacobsen, but the TFs are absolutely wonderful and are key to understanding the material.  Don't underestimate psets or midterms because the grading is actually pretty tough and not as lenient as in chem 17.  Although it was a pain going to lab every week, it was pretty doable and certainly did not ever take the 5 hours allotted for it.","This is not an orgo class. If you're at all interested in chemistry and would like to know actual chemistry rather than just memorizing random cofactors and mechanisms without fully understanding them, then absolutely do the 20\/30 track. Professor Balskus is great and you can tell she really loves what she's teaching but the course is just so bland and watered down. Also just a warning, she's leaving the course and the preceptor, Marie Spong will be the head lecturer so yeah, definitely take 20\/30. Spong's lectures were always so boring and so incredibly dry; I've never seen such little effort to interact with a class. I'm a chem concentrator and took this class for fun thinking I would learn some pretty cool biochem but it definitely wasn't worth it. It's pretty easy if you've taken orgo before but I feel like the kids who came straight from 17 were definitely at a disadvantage due to the kind of disjointed way the course was taught. I don't think it was really worth it.","only if you have to","This is a really well-taught class with many resources to help you learn and really understand the material. Though some people sometimes oversimplify organic chemistry as a difficult class meant to discipline premed students, a class that is not actually really used in medical school, I found that many things we spoke about were actually really important and interesting to learn about, and I felt that my understanding of them was deepened and enriched by the material. This includes topics such as how certain pharmaceuticals and drugs work and why certain vitamins\/cofactors and enzymes are so important. Furthermore, while I agree that the class is difficult and challenging, putting in the work and using the resources provided in the class, including doing the practice problems and attending office hours for extra explanations and answers to specific individual questions, make it a much more fun and rewarding class.","I came into this class thinking that was going to be Chem 17 part 2 (which I was not a huge fan of) but it wasn't bad at all. Yes it's a concentration requirement,  yes it's organic chemistry, but if you actually think about the big picture of what mechanisms you're doing, you'll realize that you're actually explaining some pretty remarkable aspects of life! You actually leave this class knowing a lot but you do need to spend a lot of time making sure that you don't fall behind. There is a lot of material in this class and you have to keep up. Do the practice problems. Literally, if you do the practice problems and the practice test, YOU WILL BE SET for the exam. Also, reach out to Marie. She is fantastic and really helped me through learning how to think about organic chemistry. Finally, you may think, \"Ugh, there's a weekly five hour lab\" Lab was actually one of my favorite parts of the class. Chris Kim was a fantastic TF that actually cared about us learning the WHY to many experiments and I feel like I have left this class knowing a lot about chemistry, science, and life.","Take it if you must or if you really like the material. It takes an astonishing  amount of time.","too much work, not enough payoff.  Very difficult.  Take with caution.  Never underestimate the exams.  Too much tedious memorization of mechanisms combined with nasty problems and applications.  The labs are too long and don't teach much.  ;","I really enjoyed Chem 27. The material is very interesting (more interesting than Chen 17 in my opinion), and it is an extremely well organized class (also like Chem 17). It does require an input of time, but once you have put in the time the material is really not that challenging. There are also plenty of resources (handouts, TF office hours, Peer Study Leader sections) to help you.","This class is very interesting and rewarding if you put the time into it. That being said, if you don't think you can devote several of hours to this class, I would not recommend you enroll in this. It is just a matter of practicing the mechanisms over and over again.","Be ready to put in a lot of time practicing. there is a lot of material and it is covered pretty fast.","All Aboard the struggle bus!!!  I wonder how many doctors will come out of this class #weeding","This class will require a lot of time if you want to do well. Balance your course load accordingly.","I consider this class a rite of passage; almost no one likes it but we all bear through it. You should do as many practice problems as possible in order to get comfortable with the materials, PSLs can give you extra material to work with. Beware that partial credit is stingy and the exams include unusual looking problems; even if you know everything you can still do pretty badly on a test. \r\n\r\nPlan to take light classes around this one. It demands as many hours as two normal classes between the lab and the practice problems, but if you put in due diligence you'll be alright.","This is a great class and the material is interesting although it could be challenging. spend enough time doing the practice problems and you should do well on the exams.","It's not as good overall as Chem 17.","Take this course if you've seen NAD, FAD, or glucose briefly mentioned in one of your classes but really want to know the chemistry behind these compounds. Realize though that this course requires you to memorize a ton of mechanisms\/structures and is a huge time commitment.","Go to PSLs and do practice problems.","If you approach this class with the appropriate mindset and are willing to do some work outside of class, you should have no problems with this class. First off, Professor Balskus is a breath of fresh air and is genuinely very interested in the material and seeing us all succeed. The course is very organized and you are provided with ample study resources. Lab is daunting at first, but once you realize that most labs do no come close to filling the five hour slot, it actually becomes kind of fun. The only advice is to do all of the practice problems before each exam, because they really help.","This class is really hard, and you need to work pretty much every day to make it out with a good grade. That said, the teaching staff is super dedicated and there are lots of opportunities to improve throughout the class.","You should be prepared to devote a ton of time to this class if you want to succeed.","Do ALL of the practice problems, go to office hours, especially Dr.Spong's and you will do well. The PSLs are super helpful and they've been in your position so use them. O Chem is hard but there are a lot of resources around to help and if you use them wisely it won't be as hard as you expect.","Well organized and the teaching staff is super supportive - you will get through it.","You probably have to take this course, so just know that it's most likely going to be the worst of your college career. There is only one thing that saves this course, and that is the PSL's---my grade jumped by 30 points when I started going. They bridge the gap between the lectures and problem sets (which section is supposed to do but most of the TF's are pretty awful). Good luck, work hard, and know that it'll be over at some point.","Chemistry 27 is not just a class, or a way of life. You must devote a very large amount of time to this course in order to have any chance of doing well. You must make sure you know the material backwards and forwards in order to do well on exams. The problem sets don't prepare you for the exams so you should take extra steps from the very beginning to make sure that you are understanding the material on a relevant level.","It was interesting to see how a lot of things work but at the same time this class was incredibly difficult and a huge time commitment. Unfortunately I never really learned how to study properly for this class and the efforts I put didn't show in my grade. With that being said its not impossible and this class is definitely do-able! Just make sure to do all the practice problems without relying on the answer key and really understand all of your PSETs. Reach out to your TF and get help if you need it.","This course is a lot of work, but I personally found it to be better than Chem 17 (I think I may be in the minority in that opinion though).  The instructors give you everything you need to learn the material, but it's up to you to put the time in every week to stay on top of things.  The exams are hard, but I found that putting in a lot of time studying did result in better outcomes on the test.  This course definitely caters specifically to people who took Chem 17 in the fall, and so if you're someone who did Chem 20\/30 and are looking to fulfill the biochemistry pre-med requirement, I think there are better and easier options.  I actually enjoyed the lab component of the course more than I thought I would - there's 1 or 2 that take a lot of time, but most of them are well under 5 hours (the last one is like 45 minutes!).  In general, I don't think people take this course because they really really want to, but rather because they have to, and if you suck it up and put in the effort then it's really not too bad.","This is actually a really great course.  Will require a large chunk of hours, but nothing unrealistic.  It's an interesting topic matter throughout the semester, so never boring.","If you like mechanisms (like chem 17) and pushing arrows around, you'll love this class! Chem 17 made me switch my concentration to chemistry and I loved chem 27 just as much. The pests are very fair and helpful, as are the exams. I wrote the same thing for my evaluation for chem 17: You NEED to put time into it if you want to reap the benefits and do well. There is no way around it. If you put this course at the back of your mind you will get very lost and not be happy. If you go about it with the pre med mentality of \"oh, just one of my annoying requirements,\" you will hate it. Embrace the course, even if you are just doing it for pre med, and try to enjoy it! It's really a great class.","Take it if you need orgo and biochem but the course is a lot of memorization rather than problem solving.","This class is very challenging - it requires an almost faster-than-automatic recall of mechanisms and an insane attention to detail - but it is very much worth it. I definitely understand biological processes at a much higher level now!","You really need to put in the work, early. If you get behind in the beginning, you'll be playing catch up all semester.","You are already taking this course because you are premed and already took chem 17. It's not a bad course, but I think it is more poorly organized than Chem 17. Lab is probably the best part of the course, and the lectures are pretty painful.","Study hard, do all the practice problems and do not think that you can just start studying for these exams a week in advance - it's a semester long choice, it's a semester long commitment. Do","Listen to spong","It's difficult, but it isn't impossible to improve.","It's not as clearly structured as Chem 17, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Do practice problems carefully and rewrite mechanisms from lecture; exams were pretty straightforward once I started doing that. I think if you liked Chem 17, you'll like Chem 27, but they are rather different classes in style and in content. I can't speak for PSLs, but I hear they were useful. All told, the lab component was my favorite part oddly enough.","Memorize memorize memorize. Start from the beginning. Also, be aware of what classes you take this class with.","Great class with awesome support structure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you won't regret it! You learn the molecular mechanisms behind many of the phenomena we talk about in biology, so that all the biology actually starts making sense. The professors and teaching staff really go out of the way to make this a good experience, even making videos of themselves acting as enzymes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 You'll see what I mean when you take the class!","Take advantage of office hours for lab and non-lab questions, do the practice problems\r\nDon't worry--the lab doesn't take 5 hours every week! Usually it's only 2 or 3 hours but it did go the full time once.","This class is tough and will consume your life. That said, all the resources are there to do well. It just takes A LOT of time. 3 hours of lecture + 2 hours PSL + 5 hours lab + 1 hour section + 3-4 hours psets makes this course pretty much a part time job..","While orgo is a very difficult class (and this class is not different in that respect), Chem 27 made it at least interesting and tied it into biology and drugs on the market.  However, it is crucial to keep up with the practice problems (even though it is hard). Be ready to apply what you learned in Chem 17.","Be strong, do your best, remember that you want to be a doctor.","Chem 27 covers pretty interesting material.  Learning about how enzymes function is pretty cool, and you gain a much deeper understanding of how cells go about functioning normally.  That being said, the course is basically a ton of busy work - a lot of things are based on rote memorization, which can make things pretty annoying.","Just make sure to stay on top of your stuff. Other than that, I think this is a pretty good class and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. The teaching staff is extremely helpful and PSLs are also very helpful in this course. Dr. Spong is especially great at helping you understand the material; go to her if you are able to!","Practice problems. Practice problems. Practice problems.","This class was great. Very well taught, not as bad as people sometimes complain about. You really learn most of the actual chemistry from Chem 17, this class is more about just using that chemistry in a biological setting, which makes it more about remembering different enzymes and what they do rather than about learning a lot of complicated chemistry. The labs are quite long though","First, let it be known that I took Chem 20\/30 prior to taking this class. That being said, this is an abysmal class--by far the worst I've ever taken at Harvard. Honestly, I am saddened that I wasted any of my time at Harvard on a class like Chem 27. There is absolutely no emphasis on understanding the actual chemistry involved in any problem. My understanding of chemistry actually went down this semester. The only emphasis is on regurgitating exactly what was in lecture and\/or the practice problems. If you ask a TF a question about WHY something happens, you will often be left with the answer \"well, that's what she said in lecture\" or \"I don't know\", which to me is fine, provided that isn't the answer all the time. Spoiler alert: it is. You will often feel like the TFs would rather you stay quiet instead of asking hard\/interesting questions. I just finished talking with a TF who said \"we asked for x, and you gave us a reasonable y\" as justification loosing 90% credit on a problem. Grading aside (that is up to the course staff, after all) this response epitomizes Chem 27. They couldn't care less if you are able to think about the chemistry on your own and propose a reasonable alternative. If it doesn't match the key, you're out of luck, no matter what. This class will teach you how to do the exact problems the Chem 27 staff will give you. It will NOT teach you chemistry. You should take Chem 20\/30 if you have the time. Even if you don't have the time you should take Chem 20\/30. You will not regret it.","I'll describe this class in one word: off the heezy fo' sheezy. Check it.
