I highly recommend it. Professor Seitchik is great and has created a class where you learn a ton without spending hours on meaningless assignments. It's extremely applicable to the real world and the subject matter is fantastic. Given the name of the class, the class is nearly entirely done in groups.","This course is an absolute must-take. It is the only class I have taken where I was truly excited to go to class every day.","This class is awesome!!  Take it take it take it!!!  The Professor is smart, funny, and nice, and ties in all the readings and lectures into activities you do so you can actually see how groups interact.  The assignments are fun and fairly easy, and no textbook!  You can't beat that!  By far my favorite class I have taken in my four years.","Great class and Prof Seitchick is awesome! You need an interest in group psychology and a willingness to work in small groups for an entire semester.. Loved this class","This class is awesome. The group activities are fun ways to apply the concepts to real life. The observation papers are also pretty cool and the group paper is also a great assignment."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.90","workload":"1.40","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"9","response rate":"77.78","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 1515","course_id":"11332","cat_num":"26285","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 1515","course_id":"11332","cat_num":"26285","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 1515","course_id":"11332","cat_num":"26285","1s":"4","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
