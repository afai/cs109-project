However, it does not provide you much support in trying to pick a topic. You need to come in with an idea in order to  make progress. Also, you will have to turn in little things for milestones, but  you do not get much feedback about them. Also, the certain section you are does not matter at all.

The Stata problem sets are horrible and you might as well just go to office hours rather than spend lots of hours spinning your wheels. Eventually you will come to appreciate stata but only after working through it yourself on your own thesis towards a goal.
