The end of the class can be challenging with a final paper, presentation, and exam.","Just do the readings and you'll enjoy the class!","This class can be a great way to view health from an evolutionary lens. The readings are also really great and discussions are super engaging.","I loved this class! If you're interested in why humans evolved various traits that make us vulnerable to disease, you will love this class. Though there is a short paper, midterm, final paper, and final, the weekly workload isn't bad, and all the readings are extremely interesting. I highly recommend this class!","class discussion was great and the material was really cool. definitely relevant for pre-med students, but interesting for anyone.","The material presented in this course is really interesting and is supplemented with a good deal in class. That being said, it often does not feel like the most exciting course which is strange given the interesting subject matter. I hope that there are changes in the assignments and structure of the course that allow you to think more critically and memorize less. If you take a look at the syllabus and it appeals to you, I would definitely take the class--you won't be disappointed with what you come out knowing."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.50","workload":"3.00","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"9","response rate":"88.89","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1424","course_id":"11004","cat_num":"85528","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEB 1424","course_id":"11004","cat_num":"85528","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1424","course_id":"11004","cat_num":"85528","1s":"2","2s":"5","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
