'08":{"comments":["don't be rude and show up late on the monday sessions!  even though people were told not to do this, it seemed that no one listened.  I personally felt disgusted everytime someone entered while a patient was being interviewed.  It felt like that late person didn't care enough to adjust their schedule to accomodate the patient even when the patient took the time to come talk to us late at night as well as risk their own embarassment.","One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.  Inspiring lectures and patient visits.  You'll appreciate what you learn, and, just as importantly, you'll remember what you learned.   The workload is a terrific balance: the major assignments are appropriately challenging, but the week-to-week upkeep is manageable.","This course was one of my favorite at Harvard. For people who are interested in neurobiology research or clinical practice, this is one of the best classes you could take.","It is a very informative and insightful class.","It's awesome!"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["Unless you really want to pursue an MD\/PhD, this class is really not worth the time","This is one of the few courses in which you get to meet and interact with patients, which is a huge merit in  and of itself. Furthermore, the guest lecturers are experts in the current disease research, which is based on much more basic science research on neural and molecular mechanisms in animal models. Thus, it is a great way to better understand the connection between basic science research, clinical practice and everything in between including exposure to the workings of clinical trials.","The patient presentations are excellent, and eye opening. Class is well organized and thought out, although the reading each week can be excessive. Teaching fellows and faculty are very easy to talk to, and very approachable.","Ed (and Jang-Ho when he was here) are fantastic. Ed and the facilitators worked so hard to feed us and provide us with the opportunity to hear experts in the field talk about the diseases we were studying. Yes, some of the lectures got a bit boring, but meeting the patients honestly changed my life and my outlook on my own scientific research career.","It's awesome. The patient presentations are unlike anything I've experienced during my undergrad years at MIT, and it adds a layer of realism, purpose, and enhanced understanding to the academic coursework and reading we complete throughout the term. I'm not sure how I'd improve the course; it seems they have everything figured out (but since Ed's been doing this for so long, it's hard to expect otherwise...). The speakers hail from Boston hospitals and area academic institutions such as the Harvard and MIT networks. All are excellent and many are leaders in their fields. The class is really awesome, and I can't really do it justice through this short eval or text field...."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Amazing class. I definitely learned a lot.","This is a very interesting course! There are a lot of readings (4-6 papers per week), but many of them are engaging.","The patient presentations were the best part of the class.  It definitely helps put a face to the disease.\r\nLectures are sometimes better\/worse depending on the instructor and what he\/she chooses to focus on.","Best class I've taken at Harvard.  Professor Kravitz brings together an all-star team of doctors, researchers, patients, and course staff to deliver an experience you couldn't get anywhere else.  An absolute must to take if you are interested in medical research on the brain.","Hearing from patients and receiving lectures from experts on the disease made this course truly a unique and valuable learning experience. Not too work intensive and highly interesting! Definitely worth taking! (Also, you get dinner during class!).","This course provides students with the fascinating opportunity to study neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, autism, schizophrenia, Tourette's, and more each week via presentations by researchers and patient presentations by physicians. Seeing patients with the diseases was by far the most fascinating aspect of the course, and I encourage all students interested in neurology or clinical research to consider taking this course. Undergraduate students should know going in that graduate students taking the course will most likely achieve a higher level of understanding than their own and that the final exam is not specifically written for the level of undergraduate students, but this course provides such a fascinating learning experience that you shouldn't let this discourage you from taking the course.","This is an amazing course if you're interested in Medical School or pursuing a PhD in neurobiology. The opportunity to learn alongside medical students and other graduate students really distinguished the course. The patient presentations are incredible as are the research papers discussed. If you have a love for the field, have been engaged in research for some time, and have completed several courses in neurobiology, this course would be ideal. The teaching staff is extremely supportive and knowledgeable, and the experience overall is excellent.","This is a great course, especially for premeds. It's the first time that I get to interact with patients in an academic setting. This is such a worthwhile and satisfying course.","Keep up with the readings and take diligent notes in class.","The unique format of this course is what makes it so special. Having the opportunity to talk to leading researchers in their particular fields and meet patients who have various neurological disorders is both insightful and puts a face to medicine. I loved this course!"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This course is one of the best I've taken at Harvard.","This is a really life-changing course.  It's amazing to see terminally ill patients, and hear how they are facing the disease.  Then you contrast that with what research is being done to treat the disease.  This connection between the scientific and clinical is what makes this course great (plus the awesome teaching staff and dinners!).  However try to ask questions and go to office hours or else you will get lost in all that is going on.","It's a fantastic course that is well organized and super interesting, if you're interested in the neurobiology of diseases. The teaching staff is always there to help, and there are patient visits before each lecture that really puts the lecture material and research papers we read into perspective. We also visited a stroke unit at MGH for one of the lectures and that was a really cool experience.","it's gonna be more than whatever you expect","This class is a really great exploration of neurological diseases and the patient presentation component adds a human element to academic learning.","NB 209 is one of the best classes you can take at Harvard! Getting to hear form patients and doctors on these various diseases is an incredibly rewarding way to approach these complex topics. This year, the class was very undergraduate heavy, but if you are at the college, beware that the grading standards are higher because it is a grad school course. As an undergraduate student, be sure to ask the teaching staff where you stand during the course. The final was difficult, but also did a great job of putting the whole course in perspective. Perfect for a senior spring course!","This is a good course to take if you are interested in learning a bit about different neurological diseases.","greatest class I've taken at Harvard! Definitely take this class if you can. The teaching staff is outstanding, the patient presentations are very impressive and the spectrum of disorders is very well-balanced. A great course! Especially at the college it is hard to find a course that makes medicine and curing so real!","An invaluable opportunity to personally interact with patients and learn about neurological diseases in a very real way. You also learn a great deal about how to conduct research. The time commitment is very low - your grade depends on a presentation and the take home final exam. The readings can be dense and difficult.","The patient presentations are definitely the highlight of the course, and a rare opportunity for an undergraduate. However I think the rest of the course isn't as great as it may be hyped up to be. The paper discussions are not interesting, and there is no continuity in the course at all because there are guest lecturers every week.","A very classic example of a get-in-what-you-get-out sort of class. It's very easy to get by in this class not having done the readings, but it will get you both when you take the final exam, and in the degree of knowledge you take away from the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"18","response rate":"72.22","QCourseOverall":{"number":"NEUROBIO 209","course_id":"3350","cat_num":"5562","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"NEUROBIO 209","course_id":"3350","cat_num":"5562","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"7","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"NEUROBIO 209","course_id":"3350","cat_num":"5562","1s":"4","2s":"7","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
