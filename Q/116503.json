Unfortunately it will not be taught by Professor De Sole, so I'm not sure exactly how it will be.","This class is like vegetables.  If you like them, that's great.  Even if you don't, you still gotta take it.","The material -- abstract algebra -- is very important in mathematics and has many applications. It's also a very interesting subject.","Useful and cool stuff for people intersted in math.","The class is really interesting, for its own sake. If you are a physics student, there are more important math classes to take than this one."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["I would definitely recommend the course if Mazur was teaching it again, and if the student that I was advising was willing to work hard.","Learn about Galois Theory!","Only take this course for concentration requirement.","Be prepared to work hard","Galois theory is an important class.","The material is beautiful, but psets could be routine and boring.","Take only if you want to learn about Galois theory.  I would only recommend to mathematics concentrators.","It's Galois theory. They all tell me it's very important."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The material is very interesting, and Prof. Mazur is a great lecturer.","It will make you hate math. It is ridiculously difficult, mind-numbingly boring, and completely useless - every third grader knows the quadratic formula, and that's about all you are going to learn.","If you're interested in math, the material covered in the class is interesting and very worth knowing. The course can vary quite a bit depending on the professor, but you will leave with a thorough understanding of basic Galois Theory as well as an assortment of other topics.","Math 123 is a clumsy and oafish introduction to a beautiful subject. Mazur complicates even very simple ideas so lecture isn't very useful because Artin and Lang and even Cox do a much better job explaining ideas than Mazur does. Additionally, the psets were boring and tedious.","123 is quite difficult, but Galois theory turns out to be quite satisfying, as you spend weeks building a theory from the ground up which turns out to have amazing results.","Form study groups early on, as there will be at least one topic that is more intuitive to the people around you than it is to you. Mazur's lecture style very well-suited to the material but not always to learning styles of the students. Take advantage of office hours if you notice this, as his style in office hours is much more individually tailored.","Galois theory is fascinating material from many perspectives, and I don't regret taking the class. I did experience more difficulty with it than I thought I would, and the class made me lean away from this kind of mathematics and towards physics, geometry and modeling. I am amiable to abstraction, but this material caused fewer moments of deep excitement or insight than I've had with other mathematics. Personal taste, of course. It'll vary a lot by instructor.","Moderately easy material, but sometimes a bit abstract. Some problems were interesting - most were not particularly challenging.","Galois Theory is confusing at first. Hang in there. Don't get behind on the problem sets, you'll regret it if you do.","Difficult, harder than 122, not as applicable. Interesting material in its own right, but perhaps not worth the sacrifice. Well taught. All the people who do much below the mean in 122 don't take it, so you're left with a very challenging class of people who did well in 122 augmented by a good number of 55ers who take it, which exacerbates the difficulty.","the tests are easier than the homework!","Definitely take this class if you are a math major. Also, Mazur is a very great professor and his lectures are awesome. Take a math class with him if possible. Galois theory is also a great extension of the things you may have learned in Math 122.","This class does to some extent continue where 122 left off, but the feeling is very different.  In 122, we generally proved results and immediately used them to further results, and eventually died everything together by using topics that at first glance were far afield to prove important results about things we studied at the very start of the semester.  123 by comparison was much less cohesive.  We often proved results which never showed up again in any way, making it extremely difficult to keep in mind everything we had learned.  My general feeling was that I could follow all the details and the big picture, but that everything in between was a big fuzzy area.  Some more motivation or applications would have helped tremendously.","Representation theory\/Galois theory are pretty fun, but they won't blow your mind. Of course, they are important pieces of mathematics that you need to know for the more interesting courses. I bet the course will be quite different when Gaitsgory teaches it next year, so shop the course and decide if it's for you.","Its very interesting material (and very important).","The difficulty and the workload are very reasonable. An easier course or a lighter workload would have been negative.","- great course and fascinating material, but the student ought enjoy abstract thought","necessary and interesting material for mathematics"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Take this class if Professor Gaitsgory is teaching it. He is the man. Your life is going to be consumed by this class but he is the greatest man alive. He is just super super awesome. Don't miss taking a class with him. Don't take this class if you are not ready to spend a lot of time on cool abstract algebra!!","While 122 is a very friendly, gentle introduction to the main actors in algebra, (dabbling with eensy-weensy groups, making the acquaintance of rings, etc.), in 123 you really step things up and take a more hard-nosed approach to the subject, focusing on commutative rings and fields. \"Stuff\" gets real, one might say.\r\n\r\nThe material covered is extensive - this term we mostly looked at tensoring up, Galois theory, ring spectra and localization, and representation theory - but it is definitely sequential, coherent, and totally manageable. \r\n\r\nPersonally, it changed my perspective on algebra, just because in introducing all these nifty gadgets like the tensor product and localization, it allows you to examine objects like modules over a ring and say much more interesting, deep things about them than you would think to be possible, given the ridiculous generality of their definitions! \r\n\r\nHonestly, it's freaking crazy how much rich inner structure there is to these kinds of objects, which you would not suspect from their definitions, and 123 really brought that to light, which made me a total algebra fanboy. \r\nSo totally take it, especially if it's being taught by Gaitsgory.\r\n\r\nActually, on that note, for people wondering what Gaitsgory was like as a professor, I have nothing but good news for you. He's an awesome lecturer, assignments and exams are pretty long and pretty tough, but he grades everything really easily. I'm pretty sure everyone got an A, and not because we're all total geniuses either. But yeah, Gaitsgory isn't all that big about examples, is big on commutative diagrams and universal properties, and all those other goodies that smack of higher math. Good fun.\r\n\r\nBasically, 123 was a blast, and you should definitely take it, or any classes which Gaitsgory teaches.","Math 123 was the first time in 2 years at Harvard that my best effort wasn't good enough.  Dennis Gaitsgory is ridiculously difficult, and it really hurt that we didn't have a text to go from.  However, we did learn a lot.  The last difficulty was that when the TF took the class, they focused on different things, so he struggled with the class as well.","To do mathematics (or even proper computer science), you must know algebra. Take it!","The class was definitely difficult and challenging (my hardest course this semester), which I think was Gaitsgory's intention. This class is much different than in other years because of the professor, so most of what is said here won't apply generally. We covered material really quickly, and I would say too quickly. We spent a very short amount of time on Galois theory, and never even touched on it's main application regarding solutions to quintic polynomials. It seems that his goal was breadth - just to get through as much material as possible - and not cover any area in depth. Also, he tends to skip over important parts of proofs in class that he thinks are trivial, but he does encourage people to ask a lot of questions if they're confused (which is really good), so it ends up being the student's responsibility to stop him if he does end up skipping important bits. Overall, the \"style\" of this course was not what I expected (I was hoping for a solid, deep understanding instead of a broad survey). However, I can't deny that the material was definitely interesting and the workload challenging. Probably not for people who aren't math majors.","Only take a course taught by Dennis Gaitsgory if you have a lot of time and focus to put into it. If you have a serious interest in math, you can probably get a lot out of his teaching.","Dennis Gaitsgory.  These two words alone could summarize the extensive workload, insane difficulty, and high levels of stress induced by this course.  In one word the course is even easier to describe: AMAZING!  If you want to learn math, any course will suffice.  But if you want to learn to think like a mathematician, then this course (or any course with Gaitsgory I would presume) is necessary.  And trust me, with the amount of problems you do and the time you spend on this class, you will not forget anything you learn.  This course really will change your life!","Under Professor Gaitsgory, the course covers a lot of material very thoroughly and quickly.  It's very well taught, and you learn a lot.  However, the breadth and depth of topics make it quite a lot of work.  I understand that it generally is not nearly as much work when other professors teach it.","Be prepared to work...hard. But you will learn a lot of cool algebra, and Gaitsgory is a neat guy. Go to his office hours!","This is a very interesting class covering fundamental results in Group Theory, Galois Theory, Commutative Algebra, and Representation Theory. It is abosutely necessary in order to dive deeper into Abstract Algebra.","The class varies a lot depending on the instructor. If Gaitsgory is teaching it again take it, but be prepared to work really hard. Homework (10 problems that must be typed every week) takes 20+ and more. The level of the class is such that the students are mostly from Math 55, many others dropped the class throughout the semester.","This course is very much defined by who teaches it. This year, Professor Gaitsgory's 123 was more abstract and probably more difficult than most other years. Whoever teaches it, Math 123 is strongly recommended."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Professor Harris is absolutely amazing and you must take a class with him!  He's an extremely clear lecturer and you can expect to understand everything that you hear.  That being said, this certainly isn't the hardest class you'll take (though I'm sure this largely depends on the professor).  The workload was relatively light, but I enjoyed it.","The material was interesting, the homework wasn't too difficult or time-intensive, and Harris was a fantastic lecturer.  Take this class.  :)","I'm not sure if it was the subject material or Joseph Harris, but this class was great. If you want to learn Galois Theory, representation theory, and modules, take this class.","Professor Harris is excellent. Math 123 was manageable and interesting. Do check who the lecturer is - in the past two years there was an unimaginable difference between what 123 is and how it was taught.","If you're coming to this class from Math 122, depending on who taught 122 when you took it you might have to do some extra work to fill in the \"gap\" between where 122 ends and 123 begins.  Math 123 can be a pretty large step up from Math 122.\r\n\r\nThat said, Math 123 is well worth taking, and Joe Harris was great as always.","This was a really great class and I learned a lot. It was a fairly even cover of Galois\/module\/representation theory. Joe Harris is a great lecturer\/professor and overall thug.","The material in this class is essential. Galois theory in particular brings together many fields of algebra beautifully even though some say it is useless. Joe Harris is a fantastic lecturer, though the problem sets he gives can be pretty computational rather than clean proofs.","If youre 55 level, not too much work, but still rewarding. Solid intro to rep theory and modules.","Great class, *especially if Harris is teaching it.* I tried taking the class a year earlier with Gaitsgory but couldn't keep up. Trying again, with a year more experience, I found Harris to be an excellent teacher and was really glad I hadn't insisted on trying to keep up with Gaitsgory.","It probably depends more on the professor than on the course. If Harris is teaching, take it, he's a great lecturer. The material's pretty interesting too, if not especially mindblowing.","Very interesting material!  And Joe Harris is a lucid and entertaining lecturer.","Things are harder than lecture might make them seem.","This is a really interesting class that moves faster than 122 or 25a\/b. Don't miss lectures, and don't get behind on the often difficult homework.","TAKE THIS CLASS! It was hard for me, but that barely dimmed my enthusiasm for this awesome course. If you liked 122 (or 55, I guess), then you'll love this stuff even more. Rings, Fields, and Galois theory are all wonderful to learn about. Representation theory is a little less interesting, but many parts (like most of character theory) are still enjoyable. Modules are pretty good too. The big draw for this course, though, is Professor Harris. That man is just electric when he lectures. He really made me enthusiastic about  123. Pray that he teaches this class again!","Great course! Professor Harris is awesome.","Prof. Harris is amazing, great lecturer and hilarious. Take courses from him whenever possible (this was only my first course with him, but I think I will adopt this strategy from now on...). I think courseload depends widely on who is teaching but Prof. Harris makes the workload pretty fair, not too much of a time suck.","The course ends up covering quite a bit of material so make sure that you understand each part thoroughly and occasionally come back to review, otherwise it could come back to bite you during the final.","it's hard (has a lot of 55ers in it) but worth it","It was a very interesting class, with great lectures by Prof. Harris.","The subject matter is really interesting, and Harris is amazing. If he is teaching this, you should be taking it.","A difficult class with lots and lots and lots of material (essentially three separate units: fields & Galois theory, representation theory, and module theory).  Harris is great though.","Any course taught by Professor Harris is bound to be awesome! In general you'll learn a lot of math and solve interesting problem sets.","I loved this class. Harris the best, as you probably know. He is an effective lecturer and the most humble guy. He is great and taught everything so clearly. We managed to do Galois Theory, Rep'n Theory, and started Ring Theory\/Module Theory, it was very cool.","As I gather, the class varies from year to year, and the emphasis on abstract concepts vs. concrete concepts can change greatly. The year I took Math 123, it was taught by Joe Harris, and the course was pretty accessible, with the more abstract stuff like the tensor product and other abstract constructions not really emphasized\/required for the final. The workload was sort of moderate, but psets weren't really hard, they just took some time to write up.","Prof. Harris is great and I would recommend this class especially when he teaches.","This class is fabulous, especially when taught by Professor Harris. The material is fascinating and exciting. The course is difficult, but the interest of the material makes any difficulty worth it.","This is a good course if Joe Harris is teaching it. He is just amazing. The class is very manageable and you will learn a ton. Do not take the class pass\/fail, you will end up working as hard as everyone else and you wouldn't get a grade for it.","Harris is an excellent lecturer, and his class provided what felt to me to be a well-rounded finish to undergraduate algebra.  The psets are computational as they were (at least for me) in 122, but the material should be interesting and worth learning to those interested in an introductory study of algebra.  The curriculum does tend to vary by year, though, so it's hard to speak for other instances of the course.","If Harris is teaching, take it.  He is enthusiastic, fun, and even funny.  A great teacher.","Awesome material and awesome prof.","The class composition is kind of heterogeneous, so pacing might be a bit weird, but overall it's very worth taking."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Professor Gaitsgory is amazing at everything he does.  What he doesn't do, sometimes, is try to explain intuition, so if you take the course with him (which I absolutely recommend you do), make sure to figure out the intuition behind things in class and on the problem sets.","If they are up for the challenge, take this course.","As with most Math classes at Harvard the class strongly depends on the professor teaching the class. I was fortunate enough to take the class with Professor Gaitsgory, who not only is an amazing professor, but also provided some of the most well-written notes I've ever had in any class, which made the class interesting and enjoyable despite it's difficulty and workload.","The content covered in this class is awesome. If you are taking this class with Prof Gaitsgory, be prepared to spend time digesting the material (the content moves along quite fast!) but the amount of content you learn and the growth you undergo is astonishing.","This stuff seems to be pretty important to being a math major. You should learn it! And if you work at it and don't fall behind it's not too bad.","Gaitsgory's rendition of Math 123 is great, especially if one likes an abstract approach, and loves to use tensor products.","Gaitsgory is the boss.  He sometimes goes very VERY fast, but as long as you keep up with the class he will certain get you from undergrad to grad level in a semester.","This class is awesome and Professor Gaitsgory is awesome!!  It is fast-paced and intense, so expect to spend a significant amount of time doing homework problems and reviewing notes, but it is extremely rewarding.  Prof. Gaitsgory presents the material in a really logical, intuitive way, always motivating concepts before introducing them so they seem very natural.  Definitely take this class!","If Prof. Gaitsgory teaches it, he is amazing. However, sometimes the material gets really abstract, so I found it helpful to complement the lecture notes with other material found online. Try to ground the material with some concrete examples to get the most out of the class.","When Gaitsgory teaches this class it is very special. Probably different from the other classes I have taken in the department. There are very few examples, which can be a good or bad thing, but in general the material is presented at a fast pace, yet clearly. I think I learned a great deal this semester.","It's a large amount of work\/time, especially if you're coming from 122, because the pace tends to cater towards the 55-ers, some of whom are very quick. Grades are forgiving though (extra credit).","Professor Gaitsgory is a phenomenal mathematician and teacher, and his lecture notes and homework problems are very well-done. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning some beautiful mathematics.","Gaitsgory is a genius. In the words of Prof. Kronheimer, a class taught by Gaitsgory is about 1.7 times more difficult than the same class taught by anyone else. Yet, one feels a great sense of accomplishment and growth by the end of the term. Grading is fair, so don't let that prevent you from taking the class (with Gaitsgory, that is). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that Cotton-Clay will be teaching the algebra series (or at least 122) next year. Enroll with caution.","This course was absolutely stellar. Obviously it a prerequisite for nearly all of the upper level mathematics classes, so most math majors will have to take it. However, Gaitsgory made the class one of my best experiences of my life. More than any other professor, he taught at an abstract level, and made me realize how little of mathematics I understood before, as well as all the amazing ideas out there. He taught for the students' understanding, and on multiple occasions, it was easy to see he put a lot of thought into the order of presentation as well as which proofs would be easiest for us to understand and would be most motivated in the context of the course. For one thing, before this course, I was often somewhat confused what \"show this is well defined means\" but the way Gaitsgory introduces the material makes this absolutely clear. In the class, we were introduced to abstract gadgets like tensor products and localizations, which are really prevalent in all of mathematics. Tensor producs came up almost every week in different contexts, (in induced representations and frobenius reciprocity, in normal and seperable extensions, in localizations, etc.) and seemed to magically make everything easier. This course will truly show you the power of such abstractions, and give you an intuition for how to use these fundamental techniques. If you do take a class with Gaitsgory, make sure you ask questions whenever you're confused, as he is more than glad to answer them, and office hours are also a fantastic experience. If you're serious about learning abstract math, I recommend taking any course with professor Gaitsgory you can."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This is a very well-organized course in certain topics in algebra.  We treated field extensions very well; the other topics (representation theory and linear algebra over rings) got shorter shrift, but the parts that we learned were still well presented.  The workload was also reasonable if inconsistent week to week, though this depends highly on the instructor (Gaitsgory's versions of the course in particular are known for their difficulty).","The material is really cool and Prof. Harris is an excellent, clear lecturer. Definitely take this class if Harris is teaching it!","It really seems to depend on who is teaching the class. Professor Harris was an amazing lecture, and he introduced all the topics with so much enthusiasm. Galois theory is fun!","If you're a math concentrator, you'll almost definitely need to take this class. If you took 55a in the fall, you should take this class - it's substantially easier, in fact, and the material is pretty fun. For some reason I felt like rings and modules were the only things you'd really need   for advanced math classes - Galois theory probably to a fairly limited extent, and the rep theory you learn here is kind of baby heuristics more than anything else. Harris is a super-nice guy and a really solid teacher and will make sure you understand everything, espe although he is sometimes imprecise or hand-wavey and occasionally forgets some details. His version of 123 was significantly less abstract than I expected - he did use commutative diagrams\/tensor products\/universal properties when specific situations required them, but rarely as general motivating concepts. This is not necessarily a good or bad thing - it's just something to keep in mind, considering how you prefer to learn algebra. Don't know if Allen will be CAing again, but if he does, go to his section - he's great.","More good stuff","Professor Harris is great! He really cares about making sure his students are learning things, not just mechanically taking notes in class. Plus, Allen and Arpon are both very nice and very helpful.","the material is so cool, and very important. harris is an awesome lecturer, and gives fun assignments!","This course was a great introduction to fields, Galois theory, and representation theory. Background in groups (e.g. Math 122) probably useful but definitely not necessary (I came from 25, and didn't take 122). Harris (who taught it this year) is a fantastic lecturer, and managed to strike the perfect balance between rigor and developing intuition. His real enthusiasm for the subject comes across in lecture, and makes all the difference.","This course is taught excellently, and the homework helps you get a solid grasp of the subject. The best part is Galois theory.","Harris is an amazing teacher. The class is hard, but completely worth it.","This is a great course to take, but the instructor Professor Harris was uninspiring during lecture. He basically teaches out of the book, and that is boring because you can just read the book and skip the lectures. Take this course with Professor Gaitsgory, and you will fall in love with algebra unconditionally.\r\n\r\nBe warned with the Q-ratings on this course -- Professor Harris is rated very highly because he's a nice guy, but the point is that he's not a great lecturer.","The material you learn is ubiquitous in math, and absolutely necessary if you want to go into the algebraic fields of math, but be wary of who's teaching this. Professors will take liberty with the presentation of the material.","Harris is fantastic and just makes the class enjoyable as well as incredibly informative.  Take this class.","The material was really cool, and Harris is a really good lecturer. If you're in math or a related field, I highly recommend the course because the material is just beautiful to watch unfold.","Joe Harris is awesome and so is Galois theory.","If Joe Harris is teaching this course, seriously take it. He is incredible and truly committed to teaching, which is clear in every hour of class. Harris a really engaging lecturer and is great at generating enthusiasm for the topic. Beyond this, Galois theory and Representation theory are really cool material.","This is an awesome class. Prof. Harris is a great lecturer, and you will learn many interesting topics in algebra.","I highly recommend Math 123, as the course covers great material. However, I recommend more strongly any course taught by Professor Harris, Arpon Raksit, or Allen Yuan.","Great class! The material is very interesting and Harris is a great lecturer. You will learn a lot about different topics (Galois theory, representation theory, rings + modules). Expect to work hard though as the problem sets can be rather lengthy.","If you took Math 122, I think this class is a great one to take next. The results you proved in 122 allow you to tackle much cooler problems in this class.","Awesome class :) Prof. Harris is amazing.","Professor Harris is probably my favorite math lecturer. Extremely approachable, clear, informative, and fun. He makes math less intimidating."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"42","response rate":"76.19","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 123","course_id":"2860","cat_num":"5613","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"9","5s":"22"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 123","course_id":"2860","cat_num":"5613","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"17","4s":"12","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 123","course_id":"2860","cat_num":"5613","1s":"1","2s":"4","3s":"18","4s":"8","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
