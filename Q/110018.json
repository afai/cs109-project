The readings, while a bit long winded, were very engaging and Dr. More herself is a fantastic facilitator.","This class is fascinating, but a lot of reading and a high expectation for written work!","Fantastic class!","This is a really interesting class on a really interesting topic. It's a lot of work to be able to participate actively in class, but definitely worth it. The assignments are a little long, and perhaps require a little more structure (so actively get help from Betsy). Worth taking if you're interested in these issues. Does tend to lean towards studying white feminists though; I would have appreciated more readings by black feminists","This course is AMAZING! It really does study motherhood in an academic matter, placing issues of race and class front and center. I loved that it focused so much on intersectionality. It does have a heavy amount of reading, but the readings are super interesting, and the assignments are pretty low-key (just 1 midterm paper, 1 presentation, and 1 final paper). Beware of section kids though and of people who share their personal stories way too much.","If you are at all interested in the construction of motherhood, take this class! Super interesting readings. Definitely takes a couple hours to read it all, but it's stuff I've always wanted to read anyways.","This class is structured as a hist & lit seminar with WGS content, which I really liked. Prof. More is great, and always willing to meet in office hours if you're having difficulties with a particular thing. I enjoyed this class a lot--I learned all about the history of what we understand to be motherhood\/housework in the US, and why we think about things the way we do, while also paying particular attention to racial\/gendered\/class-based biases in shaping the way we understand these things. I would definitely recommend it!","i really enjoyed taking this class! the readings, though sometimes dense, were very interesting. the discussion portion of this class was by far the best, i really enjoyed getting into in depth conversations about the weekly readings. professor more is also a great resource!","The subject matter and readings for this class were amazing and so essential to feminist thought, and the papers were interesting and enjoyable. Unfortunately the in-class discussions sometimes felt pretty limited.","Great class, definitely a must take for a wgs class. The final paper was free range and really allowed me to explore my interest. Staying on top of the readings is important in making sure the class is fun and interesting.","Super interesting, lots of reading, changes the way you think about motherhood, but I was a little disappointed that we weren't able to talk about personal experiences that much."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.40","difficulty":"2.90","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"15","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 1440","course_id":"11190","cat_num":"29785","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"6","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"WOMGEN 1440","course_id":"11190","cat_num":"29785","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"7","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 1440","course_id":"11190","cat_num":"29785","1s":"0","2s":"10","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
