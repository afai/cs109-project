Even though you have to be in the lab 8 hours per week, it is great because you can pick your hours.  Furthermore the work can be tedious at times, but over all it was not that bad.  I loved the class and found it interesting!","Professor McNally is wonderful and made himself very accessible to us.  He has a great sense of humor and the weekly lab meetings were a nice way to get to hear what everyone was working on and to see the different approaches you can take to the same topic\/Disorder.  I did a lot of computer-based work and less working with study participants, but I did get to do both which was a nice way to be involved in multiple studies and to feel like I was actually having an impact on the research.  Definitely take this course for your lab!  The disorders they study are so interesting and everyone in the lab is wonderful!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["I enjoyed it, but the work is a bit tedious and one needs to want to work in a psych lab and be prepared for that.","This class is really a great learning experience, but be expected to accommodate your schedule around the lab schedule.  Also, you will be held accountable for just about everything that you do.  Although there is great responsibility that comes with this class, it really teaches you a lot.","McNally's is an exceptional lab experience. While doing lab work isn't always fun, this lab is great because of the research it is doing and the people who are conducting it. So many generous, intelligent people willing to share their thoughts and time, which is invaluable.","Professor McNally's research is extremely interesting and compelling to the clinical psychology field, and the RA position is a great one because you are able to interact with many different types of studies. I was trained for an exercise study, coded and transcribed complicated grief material, acted as a participant to test a few studies, and even worked as a confederate for an anxiety study. This lab allows you to have many different roles in research, and you learn a lot from this exposure. Additionally, the group lab meetings kept us informed of new studies in the lab and ideas that the labs wants to research further. I bonded very much with my fellow RA's through our discussions coding specifics, as well as I was able to gain some important advice from the grad students and Prof. McNally. Being in this lab was definitely a necessary experience to pursue my interest in psych, and it was extremely enjoyable!","Professor McNally is a great professor, and everyone in the lab is really nice and accommodating. I learned a lot"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"7.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"12","response rate":"58.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2410r","course_id":"4321","cat_num":"12616","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2410r","course_id":"4321","cat_num":"12616","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2410r","course_id":"4321","cat_num":"12616","1s":"2","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
