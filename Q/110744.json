'10":{"comments":["Take this class if you are interested in classical music and the history and culture surrounding the first performances of these five great pieces. It's super interesting to get the perspective of the context of the premieres of each of these pieces. Professor Kelly is great and is a very enthusiastic and insightful lecturer. The TFs are all very good as well. This is a great Gen Ed, one of the best ones out there so take it if you have an interest in music.","This course is so rewarding with a minimal amount of \"work\" (It's listening to music!)","While the class is fun and you learn quite a bit about the pieces and composers, it is one of the few Gen Ed classes at Harvard that actually curves down on tests (on our midterm an A- was a 92 and above, and a B+ was 88-91).  You also need to be prepared to listen to the pieces many many times in order to get the specificity of the listening portions of tests, which are the hardest parts of the course.","Very fun course. Professor Kelly is a fantastic lecturer.","This class will really help you appreciate all that a composer puts into a piece, and it will probably make you like classical music more than you used to.","Definitely an awesome and exciting class. Learning new and interesting things about music and history. Take it especially if you have no musical background. A fun gen ed class.","It's a very accessible course, even if you have absolutely no background in the material. And it's a wonderful change-up to your normal class schedule.","It's a fun an intimate class where you can really get to know the professor and the TF's really well. Talking about music from an objective standpoint was a fun experience that expanded my view of music","Great class for intro and experienced musicians.","If you come into this course with no musical background expect to be crushed. There are a lot of musical terms to be learned and it is often difficult to absorb such complex terms so quickly. Unless you are willing to focus a lot of term to learning about classical music, do not take this course if you are a novice. However, if you do have some experience with classical music I recommend this course highly. The sections and lectures are fascinating and the course will expand your musical knowledge and teh way you think about music.","The lectures are enjoyable, the class does not require much work, and that which is studied is some amazing music, but the grading of reviews and papers is quite arbitrary, or unclear at the very least.","It isn't too difficult of a course, but make sure you prepare for the exams well and learn the format of the exams.  Ask specific questions and don't write musical fluff.","I would certainly take this class again.  Professor Kelly is wonderful to learn from.","It was a lot of fun, Professor Kelly gets really into it, and it's fun to watch","This class was so much fun! I was just looking for a way to fulfill the GenEd requirement and ended up really, really loving this class. I learned a lot and the work for the most part was enjoyable. The weekly section assignments are not included on the syllabus, which would have been nice to know coming in, but they weren't too terribly time consuming.","This course does not require a lot of work during the semester, but you must keep up with the work, or else it is a lot of catching up on listening the music at the end of the term. You need to spend time listening to music for this course.","If you like music, and if you're willing put a little amount of work in, you're bound to get a WHOLE lot out of this class.","A really good course...Professor Kelly is such an engaging lecturer and I found it to be a nice break from the rest of my pre-med classes because it was different but I still felt like I was learning a lot. I would recommend some experience with classical music (playing an instrument definitely helped me) before taking this class though.","This class is not conventional or \"easy\". It requires listening to the recordings, doing the readings, and putting time into the writing assignments. However, it was a very interesting and one-of-a-kind class!","This is an excellent class. The lectures are always entertaining, especially when live performers are brought in to play for us, and the material isn't difficult at all.","This is your chance to actually enjoy learning something. Take the time to learn something new, something you wouldn't otherwise take the time to learn about. Not that much time is required, but if you do put the time in to get familiar with the pieces and the stories behind them then you'll get a lot out of the course and it will stay with you. This is the kind of course you came to Harvard to take.","if you complete the assignments and listen to the recordings, you will do well on the exams.","Prof. Kelly is fantastic! He warms my heart and is the nicest person.","This course is great for people with little musical ability or knowledge who want to learn to better hear and appreciate music. It will let you hear so much more in a piece and will give you a great love for the pieces we study. Also the in-class performances and interactive nature of lecture (with Professor Kelly playing on the piano, diagramming sections of a recording, and giving historical setting lectures) keeps it really interesting and fun.","A class that you get to listen to music for homework? Awesome! It might sound a little weird and annoying to have to be graded on your music listening, but I thought it was a lot of fun to be able to delve deeper into those famous pieces and learn to like what is really strange (Rite of Spring, anyone?). The assignments were quick and painless (with the exception of the final paper, which was difficult because you had to review a new piece you hear only a couple times), and the lectures are a ton of fun (Professor Kelly's a great lecturer!). If you have any interest in classical music or music history, take this course!","This is an amazing class, and by far the best class that I have taken at Harvard.  Professor Kelly is a great lecture, and extremely accessible and easy to get to know outside of the classroom.  Additionally, the TFs make the class very enjoyable and are extremely enthusiastic about what they do.  One word of warning - it is my opinion that if you don't have previous knowledge of music\/music theory, the class might require a lot more work of you than it would if you do have this knowledge.","Prior music experience is helpful.","It is a very interesting course that explores subject matter you might never otherwise think to explore.  It certainly illuminates some very important reasons for having a classical music presence in one's life, and opens up the possibility that classical music need not be an elite, singular experience.  Finally, this class really does improve articulation skills.  Even though we wrote entirely about music, the observational skills we called upon (especially to write about the world premiere we experienced firsthand) and the analytical tools that we used to write musical reviews could definitely apply in other literary projects as well.","I would say that it's a very interesting class that inspires passion for music within a historical context.","This class is a great class to take to fulfill your aesthetic and interpretive gen ed requirement. It will make you appreciate classical music much more.","Even without musical background, go for it! It's a great class, and one of the most interesting I've taken","I thought this was supposed to be a fun and easy class. It's not. You have to listen closely and actively to every piece, and listen to it over and over and over if you want to get familiar with it. For someone who had never done that before, it's harder than it sounds.","You feel like you've come away from a class learning something truly important and applicable to real life, which is rare at Harvard. The professor's very nice, the sections and TFs are awesome and really helpful, and all of the live performances are incredible, and make you realize \"wow, I'm at Harvard\"","It's a great class if you are remotely interested in classical music. You really learn how to analyze classical music and the history component of the class is pretty fascinating. There are live performances in class and Professor Kelly's lectures are quite entertaining. However, the class is not easy simply based on the nature of the material. You'll have to be able to listen to 20 seconds of a segment of the music and identify where it is in the larger composition. You'll be surprised at how much you improve throughout the course though, so the challenging aspects of the class should not deter you from taking it.","LOTS AND LOTS OF LISTENING.  ESPECIALLY FOR THE MESSIAH AND THE RITE OF SPRING.  otherwise, a pretty painless class, although before the final, i found myself going through every piece with the score, which was an especially maddening task for the Rite of Spring. On the other hand, I did end up getting a copy of Berlioz's memoirs.","This class is an amazing gen ed class to take for those who can read music and who don't like English.  It satisfies a requirement easily that otherwise would have required a writing\/reading intensive class.  We had at most 300 words to write a week, and those were always graded very easily.  The two essays that come with course take a short amount of time to write.  This class has a very low course load.  And Professor Kelly is an amazing professor.  His facial expressions are the best.","This class is a great introduction to learning about music and it definitely gives you the tools to understand music on a different level.","Fun!","You can get by in this class without a lot of effort. But if you want to enjoy this class and do well without having to stress about cramming, you should put a lot of effort into listening to the music daily.","This course bills itself as a music appreciation class for total novices, and does indeed teach toward that population very well. You will, however, be graded both consciously and unconsciously against the sizable minority in the course with prior musical and orchestral experience, making a decent grade for the non-musically trained all but unobtainable. This leads to the extremely frustrating situation whereby you find yourself working harder and learning more than many more expert students, but receiving a lower grade than them.","It's enjoyable, but taxing in the realm of creative writing. It might be easier to solve a math problem set than to compose a piece of creative writing for you, and this course requires a lot of that kind of work. But it was fun to listen to great pieces of classical music and actually be \"doing my homework.\"","This class really does help cultivate an appreciation of the circumstances surrounding not only the premiere but each and every performance of a great work of music.","take only if you have at least some musical experience","It's really fun but it will make you work hard for a good grade","Listen to a lot of music","So take this course if you want to learn in-depth about these five pieces. If you really enjoy these pieces as it is, the course will be amazing because you will find out a lot about the cultural background of the piece and the composer and the time that the piece was written in, and it will give you a fuller appreciation of the work. Don't take this course if you want to learn about music theory and be able to apply it to the music.","Workload and difficulty dependent on TF","As time goes on, having extensive music background is going to give you advantage.","This is an amazing class! Prof Kelly and the TF are awesome and you'll walk away with unbelievable skills. The live performances and lectures are worth it!","This was my favorite class this semester! Professor Kelly and the TFs are all amazing! Don't let the fact that you may not have musical experience affect your decision to take this course. They make it accessible to everyone and trust me, the music selections only are worth it!","If you like music and want to better understand how it is put together, this is a great class. The time commitment is not very large which is nice.","TAKE THIS CLASS. It is absolutely amazing. I have no doubt that this will be one of the best and most important classes I'll take in my entire four years at Harvard. However, f you have literally no musical experience, I might choose a different course. As long as you know basic things like what a key or tempo is, you should be fine. Professor Kelly is an AMAZING lecturer and the TFs are all fantastic. I couldn't recommend this class any more!","Fantastic Course. The workload is moderate until the last week of the course.","This has been my favorite class so far at Harvard. I'm so thankful I discovered it and it has contributed to making me a more cultured student and individual. I never missed a lecture and will be attending First Nights performances next year for fun.","Professor Kelly is awesome. This course is really interesting, however if you don't have much musical background, you might find it kind of challenging.","This class is really interesting and fun.","This class is a chance to combine history with some musical appreciation and analysis.","This class is amazing.  I have always enjoyed classical music, but this class taught me how to really listen to it.  Now I enjoy it so much more.  Also, I love how this class places the pieces we listen to in historical context.  It reveals the significance of this piece in time and grounds it so it's not just a floating entity in a sea of tons of classical music.  The live performances are amazing (concerts in Sanders!), the new composition was very good, and Professor Kelly is a great lecturer.","You will come away with a rich understanding of how classical music has affected western culture over the centuries, along with a deep appreciation of varied styles of music.  The class is entertaining and fulfilling, without an overload of work.  My favorite class this term.","This class is a perfect way to learn how to enjoy music and it made my appreciation for classical music much higher. I now really enjoy most of the pieces we have learned.","First Nights is a very entertaining, enjoyable class. Professor Kelly is a goofball who loves what he's doing; his energy is contagious and his lectures are always interesting.  Kelly moves around a lot on stage during his lectures and it is very common for him to casually begin playing the piano in the middle of a thought or joke.  He also brings in musicians to perform pieces of music for the class, which is always a nice treat, and he genuinely wants to befriend his students, and will have opportunities where students can eat lunch with him, etc.  \r\nThe content may be deceiving; many people might take this class as an \"easy class\", but there is a lot of steady work one has to stay on top of, and music theory is not \"easy\" by any means.  Be prepared for an intense listening portion on the midterm.  \r\nBut despite the work, overall it is a great experience.  I would warn future students with little or no musical background from taking this course--it will be a lot easier and enjoyable if one has somewhat of a background.","This is one of those Harvard gem courses that you absolutely MUST take.","Brilliant class! I'd have to say this has been my favorite class of the semester. Professor Kelly is very passionate about this class and gives wonderful lectures with much enthusiasm and charisma. There are even in-class concerts. At the end there is an actual premier of a piece-imagine knowing that at that moment you and your peers around you are the only people who have ever heard that piece.","This is a great course if you have any interest at all in classical music or want to try something new...the work is not too difficult and the professor is AMAZING!! One of the most dynamic people I have ever met.","Listen to the pieces a lot!","You will NEED music experience. I mean the class is definitely for people w\/o music experience (no real music theory needed at all. explanations are extremely... basic). But, the listening IS difficult. There is moderate work, but you should read the book so you can know the terminology and be able to answer those essays.","Professor Kelley is a great lecturer and the material covered is incredibly interesting. The workload is completely manageable.","You should enjoy (classical) music and be willing to learn both the music and the culture around it.","Going to First Nights was a break from other classes. Sitting in Sanders, listening to music and Professor Kelly's dynamic lectures was fantastic. I had never learned about music this way before and I know appreciate the performance and pieces so much more because I understand the context in which they were originally composed and performed.","This class is really rewarding: Professor Kelly is fantastic, the section leaders are all very helpful. The workload is not hard at all, and it is, at times, very fun!","Don't let anyone fool you into thinking that it won't matter if you're a music novice. Experience in music definitely helps in this class."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Study groups are useful","The material is very interesting and Professor Kelly often points out quirky things.  The in-class performances are pretty awesome too.  However, I didn't feel very well-prepared for the final and the mid-term, based on lecture and section.  The things we discussed, while very interesting, were not exactly what was tested.","Make sure you attend lecture because you'll find there is no written equivalent of the material taught in lecture on the site (although you can synthesize it back together later); overall lectures are entertaining and fun, probably one of the most fun at Harvard! If you don't like classical music you'll still enjoy the class and like the music a little bit more by the end of it... but beware, you should listen to the pieces throughout the semester since a LARGE part of your evaluation is in-depth analysis on the music presented in the course","You don't need any musical background at all to take this course. In fact, if you have an extensive musical background, you will find this course boring and lame. If you are really interested in music and you have been playing an instrument for a while, I recommend taking one of the theory classes, or even music history. That being said, the workload is fairly light and it is easy to get by without going to lectures if you have some knowledge about music.","Don't take this course if, going in, you have the mindset that it will be an easy class\/a waste of time\/stupid. You probably won't do well. You need to put in some effort, but it's not particularly challenging. Start thinking about the two assigned papers early so that you can discuss them with your TF; they won't read drafts but they will go over your thesis\/outline with you. Don't think that, because you have musical experience, you will find the class easy; I know many musicians that were shocked by their grades on the first paper. The class is OK but not life-changing.","The class was a lot of fun, but it was much harder than I was expecting.  I have very little musical background and found it difficult to catch up in terminology and listening skills, and everyone else in my section seemed to have extensive musical background.","This class is worth taking and a lot of fun! It's a nice little break especially if you swamp yourself with a bunch of rough classes.","The professor is amazing! Take this class!","It is a lot of fun and the professor is simply amazing. The information that we learn is also incredibly interesting, and if it weren't for small concerns.","easy gened that is actually useful","The lectures were very informative and entertaining.  The teaching staff was dedicated and knowledgeable.  The book, assignments, review sessions, etc. were all helpful and clear in their purpose.  The course was well-organized and well-run.  Most of all, the subject matter was enthralling-- the course looks at several great pieces of music in a way that I, as a musician, had never looked at any music before.  Take this course no matter who you are, but if you are a musician you will especially enjoy it.","This is a great class to open your mind to a new way of thinking about music. It's very fun and makes you appreciate classical music.","Fantastic course. I will never regret having taken this course. Music background helps, but overall the course is really accessible. Professor Kelly is wonderfully animated and makes lectures a really fun, engaging experience. Plus, we have 3 live performances performed for us. Amazing. Highly recommend. I hope they improve sections, though.","This provides a refreshing way to learn with a combination of music listening, history, and analysis.  I found the course very interesting and Professor Kelly is great - impressive musician, good lecturer and the man literally glows on stage.","This class is very interesting if you know a bit about music and like studying both music and history. Listen to the pieces all through the semester...you don't want to be in the position of cramming 3.5 hours of classical music for the final.","This was definitely one of the most enjoyable classes I've ever taken.","I would recommend this class, but only if you're willing to put in the time and effort to do the listening and reading (easier said than done). Otherwise you won't be able to completely engage and you won't get as much out of the class, and out of Kelly as you can. I especially recommend it for those with no musical experience (like myself). It's a great beginner course and super-interesting to delve into a new subject.","This course is interesting and pushes students to think in new ways about music.  It is also difficult, especially if you have little music background.  Yes, it matters what experience you bring; at the same time, it is doable if you have practically none.  You will need to know the pieces inside and out, which means you have to LISTEN to the pieces EARLY and OFTEN.  There is the potential for you to get a lot out of this class, but be prepared for what it requires of you.","This class is overall worth taking if you're at all interested in learning more about music or music history.  Note that there are small weekly assignments that may not be on the syllabus.  It's not terribly difficult without any musical experience, but it will be harder to get an A.","This class is great, if you are interested in classical music. The lectures are phenomenal, the assignments are low-stress and sometimes fun. However, sections are unnecessary, feedback can be lacking, and the concepts tested in the exams are not easy. This course has a disproportionately high level of difficulty for its correspondingly low workload.","I would strongly recommend a musical background before taking this course. The lectures are very enjoyable and Prof. Kelly is a terrific and entertaining lecturer. You learn a lot about these pieces and classical music generally. How many courses at Harvard does the Professor bring in full orchestras to perform the music live! Very cool. A lot of the course depends on whether you get a good or bad TF. The papers can be frustrating to write, but they are very short. The exams are good and fair expect the listening component was hard. I would recommend carefully with reservations. Workload is low.","Don't expect this course to be one for hardcore music students; that isn't its point at all. Rather, it's an excellent course for students who want a background knowledge of a few important and wonderful pieces of classical music, or just want a fun and engaging way to fill an A&I requirement. Professor Kelly is fantastic, so be sure to take one of his classes, if not this one.","A musical background is not necessary but definitely helps. Don't expect this to just be a filler class. You need to do the listening consistently and pay attention when you listen or it will come back to bite you.","Writing about music is hard.  And the listening sections on the tests are hard, so make sure you take the time to really listen to the music.  I took this class because I was interested in in, but if I had taken it for an easy A, I would have been upset with the seemingly arbitrary reasons for losing points on things.","Contrary to what the course description says, a music background is important. Take this class if you can read music and if you have played classical\/band music. Think twice before taking it if you have never read music and have never played an instrument. You may have a more difficult time understanding what pitch is, what an accent is, what rhythms are, and what meter is for example. These are all basic terms for the average musician though - if you understand those terms, take it. \r\n\r\nExperience in classical music however, is not necessary. I came in as a jazz saxophonist and did just fine . There are certainly classical music virtuosos in the class but I think I did just as well if not better than some of them because I read the book thoroughly.\r\n\r\nNote also that history plays a large portion of this course. I personally loved reading the personal accounts of the premieres of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring.","A very good course. Material is very interesting, you don't need a strong music background to do well.","I would especially recommend this for people interested in learning more about classical music. You may not get as much out of the class if you already have exposure to classical music.","The course focuses on five different premieres in-depth, but the approach is dominantly historical with theory and musical details discussed but never analyzed at length. Professor Kelly is an amazing lecturer, and the course is great, but because of it is so enjoyable, you will also find a significant number of people who don't really care about the course except as an interesting GenEd.","As interesting as this course appears, be sure that you want to spend hours listening to five pieces of music and historical details about five events before signing up. I took this class because I love music, but I found myself quickly bored and frustrated with learning and memorizing details of which I could never decipher the significance.","Well worth taking if you do not know anything about classical music. I am very glad I took it because it introduced me to some truly great pieces of music, like Monteverdi's L'Orfeo and Beethoven's 9th Symphony. While the worry is that being introduced to these pieces of music in a class setting, to study for an exam on them, will detract from your enjoyment of them, Professor Kelly's attitude was very healthy and conducive to enjoyment of the pieces. Don't expect the class to be a cakewalk if you don't know anything about music, though. A lot of people who take it  have a lot of musical background. The exams are not terrible, but not super easy, and definitely not the type of things you can cram for, since they involve being able to name and recognize different parts of very long works of music. Don't take it as a joke class, but that said the workload is fairly light and it is very rewarding subject matter.","Like everyone else says, you have to listen to the music ALOT to guarantee success on the listening sections on exams.  If you listen only a litte then its really a dice roll to see if they give you an excerpt you just happen to recognize.  The rest is pretty straightforward.  Going through a piece once with the listening guides on the course iSite is very helpful.  Do that before you go over the piece in section and lecture and everything will be a lot easier.","This is a great class, in that the lectures are entertaining and there is minimal coursework throughout the semester. However, I would discourage taking this course if you have zero musical experience. There was major variability in the musical knowledge of students, and I found myself as a disadvantage, despite playing the piano for 10 years.","Please please go to lecture. Prof Kelly is fantastic and you will not regret it one bit. He is amazing.","This is a great class, but you have to put in consistent work throughout the semester to do well in it. If you are not a music person, you will probably go through a lot of frustration because it seems as if everyone knows more than you, but don't give up. Listen to the music regularly, even 15 mins a day would do wonders.","Listen to these five pieces from day one. You will not regret it. Many people made the mistake of not listening to a piece they didn't like (for me personally, The Messiah) and of course they will ask about each piece on the final, so plan accordingly.","This class is a great Gen Ed in my opinion, as it allows music enthusiasts to build upon that passion, and people with no music background to gain a foundation of musical knowledge. It also does not require too much reading or writing, but rather small weekly assignments, and a small textbook's worth of information throughout the semester. The curve on the midterm exam does not work in your favor, which is unfortunate, but it is also not too difficult if you study for a moderate amount of time.","I knew hardly anything about classical music coming into this course and now I can say I know 5 very cool pieces very intimately; Professor Kelly changed the way I'm listening to music from now on and I thank him for it. If you have any interest in music and have always wanted to learn what make something like Beethoven's 9th so special, take this class.","You can take this course with no musical background, but it definitely would be much easier and more enjoyable if you know some music basics.","This class is very interesting and a definite departure from the average lecture class, but I would not enroll unless you are really interested and familiar with classical music and have an introductory knowledge of musical theory.","I took this class just because it was a core. I would recommend more interest in the class, because it was completely irrelevant for my studies. however, if I was more interested in the material, it would have been a phenomenal class.","It helps a ton to have previous orchestra experience, without this the course is actually quite difficult, its tough without previous music knowledge","I would tell them that this class is a lot of work for a GenEd and that it can be difficult\/confusing at times.  But it is a lot of fun and it's enjoyable to study for the exams!","First Nights is one of the best courses offered at Harvard. The lectures, in Sanders Theatre, are thoroughly enjoyable, often featuring live music and a perfect balance of historical and musical analysis, presented on a broad variety of media. Especially if you like classical music, you will never be bored. Professor Kelly is incredible - knowledgeable, good-natured, super enthusiastic, and with a great sense of humor. The premiere at the end is the highlight of the course. The homework consists of short weekly assignments, very doable essays and exams, and a lot of listening to classical music! It's a quintessential Harvard course. Take it - you'll love it.","This class is much harder then it first appears. While it is not the hardest class I have taken, it leans more to a music class then a Gen Ed only take it if you are going to have the time to memorize and deeply analysis the pieces","Professor Kelly is a wonderful teacher.  He truly loves what he is teaching and makes you love it as well.  There is a lot of outside listening involved but I enjoyed that part of the course!","This course is interesting and well taught. The paper topics were not boring (letter\/journal\/review) and the music was so varied that there has to be something you like.","The course says that you don't need to have any musical background, but it is certainly advantageous to have it. I found this course quite difficult not having a musical background. With that said, this is a very interesting course, which will provide you with an immense background on the 5 pieces you study. The live performances in Sanders are amazing.","It is SUCH A GOOD CLASS. Absolutely one of my favorites. The choice of music is great, and T. Kelly knows what he's doing. He makes the class interesting for people of all music backgrounds. However, I will say that having a music background in this class will probably help a lot, even though it's tailored for people who have no musical background. Just understanding basic concepts about music (notes, phrases, terms, etc.) will make your life a lot easier in this class. Don't let that deter you from taking this class if you are not familiar with music -- there will be plenty like you in the class! It is still really enjoyable and the workload is not heavy at all; section assignments tend to feel like busy work, but they're short and easy, and you get to listen to and appreciate classical music.","This class deals with a lot of information-both historical and musical, and despite a seemingly light workload, the papers, midterm, and final are challenging and time consuming. Stay on top of your work! Skim the textbook, pay attention in lecture, engage in section, and listen to the pieces. Frequently.","listen to the music often. It's the best way to make this not so demanding class easier.","Do not take this course.  If you need to fulfill a gened requirement, take a different course.  This was my least favorite class of the semester, and I always felt like I had to force myself to go to lecture and section. I actually had a genuine interest and appreciation for classical music, but this class did nothing to enhance that. Many of the lectures and all of the sections seemed pointless. If your goal is to get a 4.0 gpa, don't take this class.  You essentially have to memorize all of the (extremely long) pieces of music we study in order to pass the test, because they'll play random sections and you have to identify where in which five pieces that section occurred in.  Not easy, and definitely a very useless class.","If your looking for that class that you always dreamed Harvard would have, given it's reputation, then take this class. It truly embodies the grandeur of the Harvard education.","Realize that you actually need to spend time listening to the music. It's not just about writing papers and doing reading","don't fall behind on the work for this class.  it gets really overwhelming to catch up, but if you listen and think about the music as the professor discusses it in lecture, it all gets much easier.  also make sure you're in a section you find useful.  i LOVED my section and it was really helpful.  don't expect heavy social commentary on the historical contexts of these pieces; however, having those discussions is possible if you seek them out.","This is a fine class, but you need to make sure that you know what you are supposed to be doing for the papers because often instructions are unclear.","I took this course terrified that I would be at a disadvantage from other students with a musical background. I had nothing to be worried about. By simply doing the work and readings that were assigned to me, I was on equal footing with everyone else. Rarely have I learned as much as I have from this course; never have I enjoyed a course at Harvard as much as I have First Nights.","Take it if you've been a concert musician all your life and want another take on music from the perspectives of history and appreciation. Even for people with no previous musical experience, the class can be rewarding for those that want to improve their listening skill immensely.","This is a wonderful course about music, in a cultural and histroical context!  The lectures are interesting, and a lot of fun!  This is a great Gen Ed, as I believe that it embodies what Gen Eds should teach.  I would definitely recommend this course for music lovers and interested students alike!","BEST CLASS AT HARVARD. Really try to take it before you graduate. Lectures are amazing - Professor Kelly is a phenomenal lecturer and brings in full orchestras to play beautiful music for you. In what other Gen Ed class do you get that?! If I were not a senior, I would take First Nights again next year.\r\n\r\nThe class is set-up for beginners, so don't worry if you don't have a background in classical music.","A Must-Take at Harvard, T.F.K. is an incredibly genuine, engaging professor and the assignments are fair, sections well run, and the chosen premieres are great to study","This is a great class. Tom Kelly is an engaging lecturer, and there are live concerts in class every two weeks. It is also not very demanding in terms of workload.","This class is very cool, a good choice if you're looking for an alternative sort of learning experience. The pieces are great to listen to, and the source materials about them are interesting as well. This class is definitely much easier if you have a background in music however, especially if you are able to read it.","If you have any interest in classical music but have never known how to listen to it 'properly', or if you're curious to find out what music critics and aficionados listen out for in a piece of classical music, this course is for you. The thesis of this class is that everyone responds to music emotionally, and that music analysis is all about learning the language to express more precisely why it is that you like what you like-- to vindicate that emotional response that you knew was right all along. To that end, the class teaches how to listen to a piece-- how to really listen. It was a very worthwhile class.","Just make sure Epstein is out of the picture.  If he's still head TF, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.  His willingness to subject us to crappy weekly assignments (that weren't on the syllabus, by the way) almost ruined the course for me.  The whole \"this must be the only class you're taking, so here's more crap\" attitude is impermissible even for department courses; for a gen ed or core course, it's absolutely unforgivable.","This is not an easy Gen Ed. Lectures are amazing but besides that, I found the class difficult and painful. I love music and am competent at reading\/analyzing music. However, there are better A and I classes.","This class is a lot of work, but if you are very familiar with music, it is manageable.","This class is a great way to fulfill the AI requirement, but even if it wasn't a Gen Ed class, I'd still recommend it. If you have any interest at all in music or music history, you should definitely take this class. Professor Kelley's lectures are engaging and really get you excited and interested in the pieces and their histories. This was also the only class I took in which section was both helpful and fun. There's not too much weekly work in this class, usually just a short writing assignment (around 350 words) for section, but if you want to do well, I suggest listening to the pieces on your own to get more familiar with them. I loved this class, and really encourage others to take it!","It is very enjoyable! Just make sure you do the readings, and listen to the pieces. Look at what they have on the website to help you. Those pages are extremely helpful when you are trying to listen analytically and help you to identify what you hearing.","if you like classical music, take this class. kelly is pretty awesome, and the pieces you study are great.","This was my favorite course of the semester. I hope it will be for you.","This class is very manageable and very enjoyable - take it!","Studying for exams is extremely difficult and the amount of memorization required is immense during those times, but outside of exams the lectures are extremely enjoyable and the class if very relaxed with little work.","This is a fantastic course that covers really interesting material!  Professor Kelly is great!","It is a lot of fun, you learn some new and cool things, just be ready to write something every week for class.","Attend lecture and join Prof. Kelly for lunch in Eliot when he offers. He is a generous purveyor of hard-won wisdom and a lively conversant.","Very interesting, light work but papers are graded rather strictly.","Be open minded when you listen to the pieces. You'll find that you enjoy much more than if you just listen to get the work of the class done.","I thought there were no prequisites for this course, but I disagree. I think many people without musical training are lost when it comes to the more formal aspects, which we are tested on"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["First Nights is a fun and interesting class and Professor Kelly is very enthusiastic about the material. Some music experience is a definitely plus and be sure to listen to the pieces early and frequently!","Your grade in this class will be mostly based on how well you can memorize factual material as well as the music you have to listen to. Although the course says it is meant for people with no musical experience, you will be at a disadvantage coming in without it. The essays, I felt, had to do more with the idea you can center them on rather than actual musical analysis, which is disappointing given that this is a course about music. If you're good at writing about philosophy or \"bigger picture\" ideas, and if you can relate some musical details to these ideas, you should be able to do fine on the essays. The listening portion of the final was tricky, so you really have to know the music well. Additionally, some of the questions about the listening portions of the exams were kind of vague, subjective, and not clearly explained, so make sure you either ask a TF during the exam about any questions you have or ask the TF before the exam what kinds of things they could ask about the music, and to give concrete examples to those questions. Overall, I very much enjoyed the pieces we studied, but what the course asked its students to do had little, I felt, with understanding what was going on behind the actual music.","Prof. Kelly is a fantastic lecturer; it's a tried and true course that has been taught for over 20 years, so everything is run smoothly. This course is perfect for beginners who are interested in learning the basics of music appreciation, but note that you will be at a disadvantage compared to those who have formal training. Section assignments can be a nuisance, but otherwise it's 2 papers, a midterm, and final, so not too burdensome.","Take this class if you are interested in understanding classical music! The selection is amazing and I found that the more I listened to the pieces, the more I appreciate them. Now, I play Beethoven or Berlioz whenever I want to relax. Be sure to LISTEN to the pieces often, because in the final they picked a random 5-second clip of chords which would have been impossible to identify without listening to the pieces all the time. Overall, the TFs are amazing and Professor Kelly is super friendly and has his lectures down to a science. The material on the midterm and final is really straight-forward; they give you all the vocab and possible essays. The only difficult part was the listening.","Take this class! It's very low workload, lots of fun, and very interesting.","It's interesting and the professor is good, but section is not enjoyable or helpful and the listening parts of the exams are difficult.","Its great to learn about the music and the history, the lectures are fun, its a unique kind of class and kind of work and a good opportunity. The assignments and sections can be really frustrating. Take this class for fun so you aren't that worried about your grade.","Even if you have an extensive music background, this class may be harder than you expect. Assignments are fine but grading may be excessively hard.","The course was a good AIU gen ed for me. Also, I'm not sure how difficult the grading will turn out to be- so far things have seemed okay for me, but I do not have my final grade yet and I've heard they can be harsh.","Take this class only if you already understand music theory and can write well. You spend most of the semester studying the theory behind the pieces for the class, then suddenly they pull out a review you're supposed to write that determines 30% of your grade and you have no idea what you're doing because for the only practice you wrote (which you wrote 2 weeks before the final paper) the TF writes something about good evidence, improve organization. At this point, you assume that if you better organize your paper, but attempt to write similarly to how you did on the practice paper, you'll be fine on the final paper. This is incorrect, the TF's suddenly assume you've improve your review writing like 1,000,000 fold, and they infer things from your paper you had absolutely no intention of implying, and your grade plummets. Pretty much your grade depends on writing something you had little practice for. The music is really cool though and fun to learn.","More suitable for people who do not have prior musical experience.","NEED MUSICAL BACKGROUND.","It carries a historical aspect and merges it with the world of music, which is a very interesting and enriching combination.  I highly recommend this course.","I feel that you should stick with the course only if you are sure that you enjoy listening to a great deal of classical music ranging from Monteverdi to Stravinsky and like to speak and write about music. The course itself is not particularly engaging in that many students lose interest pretty quickly and stop showing up to class. Only around the midterm paper, the midterm exam, the final paper, and the final exam do you do a considerable amount of work. Otherwise, the course is pretty bland and does not require much work. Take this with a grain of salt, however, as easy is definitely not always good.","Gives you a new appreciation to music!","The only people this course serves well at the moment are the numerous elderly auditors. People without musical backgrounds learn but are given unfairly poor grades while people with musical backgrounds receive good grades but are bored out of their mind and sigh every time they speak in section.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE.  It is impossible to do well without it, and this class should be restructured as a music department class.","You will learn an equal amount about history and music.","Good class, good music, enthusiastic professor, interesting ideas about and ways of seeing music; just be prepared to cram random historical facts before the midterm and final","If you're expecting an easy fourth class to balance out your schedule, this probably isn't the class you're looking for. As much as it seems like all you do is listen to music all class, there's much more work that needs to go into it. Also, people who have musical experience definitely have an advantage over people who have none.","If you like listening classical music, this is simply an amazing course","This is one of the very best classes I've taken at Harvard. The lectures were superb!","It's a little bit redundant in some ways for musicians.","This is a great class, but it's hard to overstate just how much easier it will be for you if you play an instrument and can read sheet music. This will be a serious challenge if (like me) you didn't have any background, and it will be a breeze if you're in HRO.","Absolutely take this class if you love classical music and wish to learn more about its various iterations in a historical context.","Good class; even better if you have musical experience.","This class is amazing! Professor Kelly is excellent! He generates a lot of excitement about the class.  I wouldn't be the same without this class.  TAKE IT!!","First Nights is an awesome class! Having known all of the pieces beforehand, I really got a chance to get a more intimate understanding of the back stories of the works, as well as the underlying transformation of music throughout history. The listening portions of the exam can be tricky, so make sure you really have time to devote listening to works and thinking about them. I would warn those without musical experience, though.","The class was incredibly entertaining. If you already know a lot about classical music, this might not be for you, as the five pieces studied are extremely famous. But if you're interested in the history and innerworkings of the music, you'll get a lot out of it.","I thought this was a great class. Having a background in music definitely helped me a lot (particularly if you've played\/sung one or more of the pieces in the past). Start listening to the pieces early; it'll really help you when you're studying for the midterm and the exam!","Take this course. It opens your eyes to music without requiring a background in music theory, which is often hard to do, but Prof. Kelly pulls it off insightfully and engagingly.","It's a great reasonably low pressure gen-ed that has very fair assignments and two short essays (around 4-6 pages). It's definitely a good course to take if you, like me, needed to fulfill AIU but didn't want a literature course and had a heavy semester with three other difficult courses. Just be sure you don't put off First Nights for too long as you did need to listen to the pieces A LOT in order to do well (especially on the midterm and final). Professor Kelly is great and the TFs and great and it's really just a fun class to go to whether you have a lot of musical experience or not.","If you curious about music, want to learn more, and leave a class with a rewarding experience, First Nights is the class for you.","This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard! I think everyone should have to take this course!!! Professor Kelly is amazing. If you do take this course, be sure to go to lunch with him.","The course is a good mix of musical analysis and musical history. The assignments can be pretty open ended, but overall painless. Despite what the course description may tell you, a background in music is very helpful.","Professor Kelly is amazing. He is genuinely interested in the material. His enthusiasm is almost infectious.","It's an informative and great class, with a phenomenal professor.","It is helpful but not necessary to know how to read music. The tests' listening sections are hard: you have to spend a lot of time listening to the music to do well. But other than the two essays, there will be no other homework.","Take First Nights, it will change your life. I have no previous experience in music and this class made me not only love classical music but also able to talk about it. Professor Kelly created a class that has a perfect balance between music theory and history of music. By the end of the class you might not be able to sit on a piano and play but you will surely listen to all kinds of music (even Shots-LMFAO...) and understand what it is that makes you say \"damn, I love that piece\" or \"please turn this off\". If you end up going for lunch with Prof. Kelly (which I strongly recommend), his passion for what he does will make you realise that GenEds aren't there just to fulfil requirements but that they can truly change who you are.  Overall, best AI GenEd EVER!","start listening early!","This class accomplishes what it sets out to do. Provided that you apply yourself to some degree in the course, you will improve your knowledge and appreciation of classical music. However, this class is by no means a joke; the listening sections on the exams are challenging, and there are decent expectations for your work on the papers. This class is also a good way to get Gen Ed credit.","This is a fantastic course. It was thoughtful and interesting, and I always wanted to go to lecture. The professor is very engaging and makes the lectures fun. I found some of the weekly work to be mundane and tedious, but other than that I really enjoyed it!","If you want a class that really meets that \"Harvard\" appeal, do it. Probably one of the most amazing courses offered at Harvard.","Make sure you have at least some music background.","Savor it! It's so different from other classes that you take."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It is a great class to explore musical advancements in society through the premieres of great compositions. Great class to take for the general education requirement.","If you don't have any prior knowledge about music, this course might be very challenging. You do now know the extent of the difficulty until the final exam. You might be surprised how much of a knowledge is asked on the exam. During the course of the class, such knowledge is not required.","First Nights is a course worth taking as long as you understand that what you put into the course is what you get out of it. It requires very little time to stay on top of the materials and understand everything; if you do this, the course will be relaxed and easy.","First off, this course should not even exist anymore, as there are much easier ways to satisfy the A+I gened credit with a music course, such as the course entitled, \"From R&B to Neo,\" that explores the history of black music. This course is a very painful way to satisfy the A+I gened credit, as it requires extensive previous formal musical training to succeed, because so many of your classmates will have such training. The last paragraph of this Crimson article: http:\/\/www.thecrimson.com\/article\/2009\/8\/20\/how-to-game-your-classes-okay\/ is quite apt in this situation. \r\n\r\nThis course requires you to memorize random historical details about the musical pieces, which are ultimately useless. You will forget them right after the midterm, will relearn them for the final, and then will forget them again. Similarly, you need to memorize the five musical pieces that you will be studying, which is about 4-5 hours of musical material. It is a painstaking and annoying process. The 4-5 hours that I spent each day during reading period listening to these pieces were not even worth it, as I still struggled with the listening portion of the exam. It is very difficult.\r\n\r\nBe very wary before taking this class, as the grading on the essays is quite arbitrary as well. Professor Kelly does have an enthusiasm for the material, but that is probably the only upside. I left this course despising classical music and with less of an appreciation than when I came in, as I even studied some during high school.","Really fun and interesting, and not a lot of work!","You should be able to read musical scores and you should be able to identify different instruments when you listen to them if you're considering this course.","Professor Kelly and the TFs are all so knowledge and helpful. This is a great class for musicians and non-musicians alike. The course load is extremely manageable. This class is eye (or ear!)-opening because it forces one to listen more carefully to a piece of music which is a skill helpful to both musicians and nonmusicians.","Loved it. Tread carefully if you don't have a musical background-- it will still be possible to do well without understanding everything everyone else does around you ( because like 95% of my peers had musical background and picked up things from lecture that I didn't just because it was a ton of new info), but your appreciation shall be more if you have background. I didn't, so I got a tutor so that my lack of experience wouldn't take away from the pleasant experience this course is otherwise.","The class was great and really entertaining. The only part i didn't like was the final performance but that changes every year.","This is a good course. It teaches you a lot if you don't know much about classical music and it is relatively low-stress. It teaches you more than a lot of non-science courses as in many ways the music theory you learn is a formal skill and set of knowledge. I appreciated this very much. Don't get too bogged down by the scores and reading music. It is helpful but not essential. Just focus on enjoying the music and paying attention to detail.","I would really recommend this class. While it can be difficult at times, I feel that the grasp of history and music this class covers is helpful in becoming a well-rounded person and having an appreciation of the past.","Great course, a lot of work at times, but overall developing the capacity of critiquing music is invaluable.","The course does a good job of presenting 5 musical pieces both as stand-alone pieces and products of historical context. It also commissions a brand-new piece of music at the end of the year, which is pretty neat.\r\n\r\nProf. Kelly insists that you don't need any musical background to successfully take the course. This may be strictly true, but if you've never looked at written music or engaged in critical listening before, it will be very challenging. If you have even a basic knowledge of theory and a half-decent ear, you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a lot of work, but the class doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spread it out very well. It has 4 main assignments: 1 paper imagining the premiere of a piece, 1 review of the newly commissioned piece and two exams. The papers and exams are due close to each other,  so it feels like you sort of have two weeks where you spend a lot of time on the class, and the workload in between is such that you can pretty much ignore the class in the interim.\r\n\r\nThe class asks you to buy an expensive (~$100) sourcebook, which has the complete scores of the five pieces we study. I used it maybe 3 times. Unless you're really into the class and are going to devote a lot of time to looking at the score, save yourself the money and don't buy one. Or buy one copy for a four or five people and split the cost.\r\n\r\nJoe is a really good TF.","Great class, not time-intensive and fun to learn.","This course is pretty much everything an ideal gen ed should be. Even if you have an extensive musical background, it teaches you to look at what you already know from different angles that make you appreciate musical knowledge even more. From the history behind the pieces to methods of critiquing music to aspects of music composition and performance, this course successfully integrates it all. I've heard some say that the course was more work than they would have expected for a gen ed, but you learn a ton. Plus Prof. Kelly is hilarious and lectures are actually fun to go to.","It's a great class-- Kelly is a fantastic lecturer, and the teaching staff is great, too.","Take this class! It's a lot of fun and it provides a nice break from psets and other typical assignments. The music is beautiful and section is very interesting.","This is a great class. Professor Kelly does a fantastic job of combining the technical aspect of music with the history of these five premieres.","It's a really interesting way to learn about and talk about music.","First Nights was a fantastic class, and very different from any other that I've taken at Harvard so far. It was so relaxing to be able to take two hours each week to listen to some great music and hear Professor Kelly speak about what it might have been like to be at the world premiere of that same music. Definitely a great way to fulfill a GenEd requirement!","This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Harvard. The professor is a phenomenal lecturer, and will make you appreciate the music presented even if you may not enjoy it. I am a classical music buff, but I still learned so much about the pieces. I even learned to enjoy Stravinsky, something that I thought would never happen. If you have the opportunity to take this course, definitely do so!","TAKE THIS CLASS. This is one of the best classes you will ever take at Harvard!! Professor Kelly is a joy to learn from. Going to both lecture and section was the highlight of my week. The 5 pieces you study are amazing and I love being so familiar with them now. If you like music, fascinating history, and unreal professors, you will LOVE this class.","This is an incredible class. Without requiring background (though it is helpful), it gives you the skills to talk about and analyze music intelligently. The exams are unnecessarily tedious, but the rest of the course is a delight. Each lecture is a performance, and watching Professor Kelly dance around on stage and show pictures from his travels makes the music and the history behind it come alive.","TFK is a great lecturer, sections were engaging and interestinng (and I had a 9 am section).","It's an interesting course and the Professor Kelly is a great lecturer.  The final and midterm have listening sections in which you must recall sections of the pieces, and considering these pieces can be hours long, this can be difficult if you don't listen to the pieces regularly.","This class is a great way to get Gen. Ed. requirements out of the way.  The professor and TFs are very enthusiastic and it is obvious that they really enjoy teaching this class.  There is also not very much work for this class, just a short assignment each week beginning three weeks in and then two papers throughout the semester.  The only part I didn't like was that we needed to purchase a textbook and sourcebook that we rarely needed or used.","If you want to look at music with new, educated eyes, this is the course to take.","Prof. Kelly is among Harvard's best and I feel I learned so much about music and musical history in a short time, and that I can walk into any musical performance and feel very literate.","Just take it. The ability to relate to music is one that is necessary to understanding the human spirit because the power of music to relate to human feelings without using words is an enhancement to one's perspective on life.","This class is amazing!!!! Professor Kelly's lectures are incredibly entertaining, and he is a very friendly man. The subject matter is great as well, five great pieces, which makes the class always a pleasure. Take this class!","It is a lot of work for a Gen Ed, but you learn a lot about music.","Very fun and rewarding","Some musical background is helpful.","If you are interested, take it. If you like the subject matter you won't be disappointed.","This is an awesome class that will really make you appreciate music","the tests are all based on memorization, which I found very annoying.","Tom Kelly is one of the greatest lecturers at Harvard. He is excited about the material in a way that truly makes it come alive. Lectures feel effortless, and I loved that there was live performance at times. Sometimes the response papers for section feel like a slog. The two papers aren't tough (short in comparison to most of my other assignments!) but the listening sections on the midterm\/final are difficult. Make an effort to start regularly listening to the five pieces instead of trying to cram in binging on four hours in the two days before each test...it's good study music! Course provides good review sheets (list of possible IDs and essays) although grading on the tests was a little harsher than I'd expected. Nice to have some background in classical music or music reading. Great course!","Avoid","This class is a fun one -- what other class requires listening to music over and over again to study for the final? The two papers are pretty straight forward, but TALK TO YOUR SECTION LEADER about your thesis-statement before you turn it in. The grading on the papers seemed pretty subjective, and I do think I would have done better on the first one had I talked to my section leader before hand.\r\n\r\nSection frustrated me at times, but the overall aim of this course was a good one. In the end, I left with a much greater appreciation for the five pieces of music we studies -- I continue to listen to them even though I don't have to play them all on repeat to study anymore!","Go into this class expecting to take three courses: the First Nights in lecture, the First Nights in section and doing homework, and the First Nights in a lecture hall taking your final exam.","It's easy, it's a nice change of pace from lectures and note-taking.","Professor Kelly is a fantastic lecturer.  He makes the course seem like something straight out of PBS.  Take this course if you want to learn about music, though beware that most (or at least a lot of) students have (extensive) musical experience.  That being said, it seems like the course has a pretty narrow vision on how to view music, so there is focus on a lot of specific terms.  At times, being \"too musical\" in essays garnered negative feedback in essays, so try to be general and think like a lay person if you have a musical background.  Definitely start listening to the pieces immediately and as much as possible--the listening portions on the midterm and final exams are much harder than anything else, and that's something you cannot cram for with a day, or even with a week.  The listening can have the most obscure excerpts, so listen to everything many many times.  Everything else on the exam is run of the mill: a list of terms are given on review sheets and potential essay topics are also provided beforehand.  Just study these, and you'll be fine.  The second essay (on the premier) is really close to the final exam, so that's a drawback.  Section is great and can be extremely helpful to brush up on lecture material.  (Also, lecture closely follows the book, but going to lecture is a treat.  They sneakily said they weren't recording lectures but ended up putting all lecture videos up during reading period.)  Overall, a great way to fulfill a Gen Ed (A&IU or CB!) while listening to fantastic music.","While lectures are always interesting, sections led by Emerson Morgan were dull, unproductive, and uninformative.","This course was a great way to start my day. I really enjoyed the works, the performances, and the information presented in this class.","Beware - this class requires an exceptional amount of work for a gen ed. Section assignments are incredibly long, and I was not aware of that fact based on previous years' q guides. Also, make sure you have the time to devote to listening to these the pieces. I thought it would be easy coming in as a former musician\/performer. However, you have to know details of context, down to \"what is happening on stage as this excerpt is being sung,\" and \"what happens right before\/after.\" Even coming in with my background, I can say that the final tested some pretty difficult excerpts. I have no idea how students without significant prior knowledge fared in this class, but it must have been difficult for them.","This class really helps students to appreciate classical music; a very fulfilling course!","This course fulfills the goal for a gen ed class perfectly. It wasn't too much work, but was interesting and engaging. The homework never took more than 3 hours per week, with the exception of the paper weeks (fewer than 1500 words each). The midterm and final were easily manageable with just a few hours of studying. If you like music you'll enjoy this class, and even if you don't you'll still find it interesting.","If you have prior musical knowledge, this class will be fun and interesting. If not, then be prepared to get really in touch with your musical side. If you don't like classical music, just stay away altogether."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This is a fantastic course. It helps to have a musical background, but is definitely not needed. This course focuses on the premieres of five pieces of music, and studies the players and places involved as much as the music itself. Prof Kelly is an incredible and dynamic lecturer, and the live performances we have in class makes the course material come alive. The capstone of this course is the world premiere of a new piece of music - it is an experience that few courses can and will ever provide. I highly recommend this course if you are interested not only learning about music, but also if you want to be able to better appreciate music.","Good course, Prof Kelly is really good, but make sure you are actually willing to put some time in listening to the pieces and keeping up with a bit of the reading. Hurts the experience to totally blow it off for most of the semester until the midterm\/final.","Very interesting, but listening portion can be tough! You'll gain a lot of music appreciation out of this course though!","If you are willing to put in the time to listen to the music, I think you will enjoy this course. Homework assignments can be a bit sporadic. Everything is sent online or by email, so make sure you stay on top of checking that.","Definitely take this class if you have the time in your schedule. It's a great class to simply enjoy what you're learning about and can definitely balance out a difficult schedule. Professor Kelly's lectures are basically like performances - none of my other classes clap when every lecture is finished.","I loved this class beyond all reason! It wasn't a topic I thought I had any interest in, but the lectures were amazing, section was incredible, and I discovered a very real passion for a new course of study.","This class is absolutely fantastic.","This is a fantastic class. Professor Kelly is a great professor and I actually enjoyed going to Sanders to hear him talk every lecture. The midterms and finals are no joke, however, so be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the 5 pieces taught.","This class is a great way to fill the AI Gen Ed. In learning about music, it provided a nice break from other classes and an opportunity to study something different. Professor Kelly in incredibly enthusiastic and one of the best lecturers I have found here. I would have taken this class as an elective if I hadn't needed to fill AI.","This class will change your relationship with music in the most fantastic way.  Listen to the pieces a lot and approach section with enthusiasm, and you will get so much out of this class and do well. I want to keep this simple because the class is so wonderful- it should be considered a standard of Harvard college.","This class is one that you will not regret.","This class is so fun! Professor Kelly is an awesome lecturer and is such a talented musician. It is really interesting to get to know the pieces. The listening parts of the tests can be hard, but overall I would definitely recommend this course.","Great class, if you like and want to learn more about music! Prof Kelly's lectures are a lot of fun, and the live performances are an awesome way to spend an hour during an otherwise stressful week. Know that you will have to learn to identify and analyze music just from hearing a passage two or three times (but the class does a pretty good job of teaching you how). Having a musical background was very helpful for me, but the class is doable without one as well.","First Nights is great. Thomas Kelly is great. If Western classical music is completely alien to you, it might be a bit difficult at first, but the pacing is easy enough that most people should be fine.","It is a very interesting class. I loved every piece we learned about, and was inspired by professor Kelly's idea that music is something that happens once at a particular time and space and disappear forever. However, I feel sometimes it is more of a show\/speech rather than a practical and informative  class. For instance, the music knowledge we learned is not very systematic, because Professor Kelly often just brought up a technique when it appears in a work, and what we got were mainly separate pieces of information not linked together.","I loved this course and didn't miss a single lecture because it felt like such a privilege to be enrolled in it. I definitely encourage people interested in classical music to take it, even if you have no previous exposure to music. My older brother who really doesn't like classical music also liked it because the professor is very dynamic and makes the material accessible to everyone.","This course is an incredibly fun way to learn about music. Thomas Kelly is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and the multimedia format of the class makes it feel truly immersive. No matter where you stand right now, I believe that this course will make you love listening to music.","This class was just really chill and an amazing experience as well! Professor Kelly is such a nice, engaging professor, and the design of the course and the material presented is fantastic. I will say that some of the listening analysis would be harder for those with less of a musical background, though that shouldn't deter you from taking the course.","I highly recommend taking this course. It really does do a great job catering to both people who are very musical, or not musical at all. Also, prof. Kelly is one of the best lecturers I've seen at Harvard. He really does a great job making the material interesting, and clearly loves it himself.","This class is a very different course. In very few courses are you going to be asked to spend time critically listening to great, sometimes lengthy, pieces of classical music that stand out as some of the most brilliant pieces of classical music ever written. In addition, this course requires you to not only study and listen to the music, but learn and explore the history behind it. This exploration of the history surrounding the premieres of these pieces can be slightly un-interesting at times, but it does help you understand the piece all the more. The exams do require you to know numerous terms (pulled from the  history of the pieces), and having to remember all of them is a bit frustrating,  and seemingly unnecessary.","If you want any professor at Harvard, it is Professor Kelly. He is so knowledgable, so passionate, and so friendly. This class is in Sanders AND taught by an incredible professor and teaching staff AND about something so incredibly interesting!! STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!","!Great class that I really enjoyed and had a manageable workload, but although music background is not required, it really helps with the class.","I think if you have any interest in classical music, or even music in general (as most people do), it's a great class whether you need to fill an elective or a gen ed credit. Professor Kelly is an amazing lecturer and a great person overall, as are all of the TF's.","Take this class if you have any love or interest in music.  Seriously, Prof Kelly is the best.  He is engaging, humorous, and knowledgable.  When you pick up the course book, you tend to read it in his slight Southern accented voice.  The book is a pleasurable read that I continue to peruse outside of the course.  I loved going to lecture, it was one of my favorite parts to the day!.","It is not a lot of work except around times of big assignments and it can be difficult with no musical experience, but otherwise it is a fantastic class in which I learned a lot and lectures are so much fun to go to.","First Nights is a fun class to take that doesn't require too much work. Professor Kelly is a fantastic lecturer and the teaching staff this year was amazing.","This class is fascinating and is a great way to become acquainted with classical music.","This is a fun class. Every day I sat in First Nights lectures I thought, \"Wow, this is why I love college. This is the amazing stuff we come here to learn about.\"","This class is really incredible in some ways, yet has its faults. It provides a great look into five very interesting pieces, all of which are situated in a specific moment of time and composed by very interesting people. All of this is discussed in length, but this course is hard to appreciate if you don't already have some sort of appreciation or respect for classical\/non-modern music. Professor Kelly is incredible, as is Michael, the TF. Assignments sometimes seem like busy work and there is a TON of music that needs to be basically memorized, but aside from that, I really enjoyed this course.","This is a great course to take if you are taking other very difficult classes and would like to lighten the workload.","This course made me question my most fundamental beliefs about my cultural preferences. By the end of the semester, I had fallen in love with four pieces I came in ready to hate (and not because I'm an uncultured heathen, but because I had pretentious but woefully uninformed \"opinions\" about Renaissance music, Romantic art, etc). The listening is definitely a challenge, but such a pleasure. Monica and Michael are both terrific section leaders. Highly recommend.","This course will teach you how to appreciate and understand music. It will develop your ability to listen to and play music.","If you like music, fun lectures, and don't have a ton of free time to dedicate to a Gen Ed class, this is a great class for you.","Only take if you are extremely passionate about classical music. If you come into it without previous musical experience or past knowledge of classical music, you will start off behind a lot of the class. Not a lot of work, but exams are brutal... stay on top of listening and form study groups.","You'll enjoy the work!","Take First Nights!  It has a very easy workload and interesting material.  Professor Kelly is an animated and charismatic lecturer, and the TFs facilitate discussion well.  Recommend 100%!  (Little known fact:  First Nights also completes Culture + Belief.)","Professor Kelly is the teacher you want at Harvard; quixotic, hilarious, and engaging. He appeals to everyone and makes his class immensely enjoyable. If you have even the smallest inkling to take this class, do so--you won't regret it.","Take this course! It's such a wonderful class. There's no better way to begin your day than a live performance in the morning, or an engaging lecture from Professor Kelly. The music is perfect, and he gives you the right tools to be able to listen to it effectively.","This is a fantastic course. Professor Kelly is a very engaging lecturer and you really learn a lot over the course of the semester. Section is valuable, as well. It is certainly not necessary but probably helpful to have some kind of musical background for this class","This class is great to fulfill either Aesthetic and Interpretive or Culture and Belief. There are various things that one can focus on (history, music, culture) that can keep many people interested, but that may sacrifice some cohesiveness to the course. Take it if you want take a course with a moderate courseload and are interested in any way in music.","This is a course on classical music. Is that something you would devote a semester's worth of time to study?","This class is a fun way to satisfy a Gen Ed, particularly if you enjoy classical music. Professor Kelly is a very engaging lecturer, and not very much work is required. Weekly section assignments are very manageable, as are the two papers (one of which has a creative aspect). Tests are reasonable, but it definitely helps to familiarize yourself with the music (listening) throughout the semester.","This is a great way to fulfill the A&I requirement whether or not you have prior experience with music. Professor Kelly is a great lecturer and makes learning about each of the pieces really enjoyable. The way the course is set up, it gives you an overview of the last 400 years of music history through snapshots of different musical premiers. In addition, this class isn't super time consuming, even though it is helpful to listen to the pieces consistently throughout the semester to avoid cramming for the listening portions of the midterm and final. The bottom line is that this is a really enjoyable and rewarding class without being a massive time commitment.","This class is an amazing opportunity to take advantage of the unique courses at Harvard, the brilliant Professors, and the chance to study something you would never have considered before.","The required materials for this course are a waste of money. Don't buy them.","I really enjoyed this course- Michael is a wonderful TF and Professor Kelly is incredibly engaging.  Lectures were very enjoyable. You definitely get more out of the class if you have a musical background  but it's still easy to do well in it regardless if you go to lecture and section.  You definitely get out what you put in.","You should definitely take this class! Not only will you learn a lot but you will also leave lecture every day relaxed and happy simply by listening to Professor Kelly speak passionately on music.","Really interesting material and lectures- a class that you look forward to going to every week.  A musical background may not be necessary but will definitely lessen the workload.","you should have a bit of a background in music and be able to identify and independently study specific pieces of music","Fantastic course, lectures are amazing and the music is superb!","Although Professor Kelly is very animated and makes lecture enjoyable, the class is unclear in its expectations of students. There are a lot of seemingly random facts given about the premieres and a lot of the information that we were expected to memorize did not seem very important (eg. that one of the composers fell in love with someone who wore pink boots early in his life). While there is interesting musical analysis, the class is unnecessarily stressful because you have to memorize a lot of music that you don't discuss in class which leads to many hours spent repeating melodies instead of really engaging with the music.","Its a pretty interesting class and the coursework is not too intense.","This is an excellent course! Take this because you can learn about classic works in both a historical and musical sense, and they actually give you a grade to learn something you might never have a chance to study quite like this outside someplace like college.","it's lots of preparation for the listening tests","The description is a lie, hope you like music theory!","This course does a good job of combining history and musical analysis.  The structure is a little disorganized, but the courses teaches a significant amount of analysis of classical music while putting each piece of music in historical context.  The hardest part of the course is identifying clips from the pieces on the exams.  For someone who has not had much previous exposure to classical music, it can be very difficult to distinguish between, for example, different excerpts from \"Rite of Spring\"."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"89","response rate":"86.52","QCourseOverall":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 24","course_id":"1902","cat_num":"0144","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"1","4s":"26","5s":"47"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 24","course_id":"1902","cat_num":"0144","1s":"3","2s":"21","3s":"28","4s":"9","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"AESTH&INTP 24","course_id":"1902","cat_num":"0144","1s":"38","2s":"27","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
