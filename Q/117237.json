The second half is more different and does teach useful material about corporate finance","I found lectures boring and the grading unfair depending on a student's background.","It's useful for people like me, who know absolutely nothing about finance. If you already have some background, it might seem slow at times.","It is a good class but I would check out whether you like the instructor or not.","I wish I had not taken this course.

Unfortunately, there weren't any during the Fall of 2008. Hopefully the Spring will be better.","This course is cut and dry, with the emphasis on dry.  You won't be wowed, but you probably also won't hate it.","Based on math and nothing else.  Class attendance not required.

However, this may only be the case because of Professor Larrain.

Effi genuinely cares about us learning the material and it makes all the difference.","You probably would fall asleep in lecture.","This is a worthwhile class. You will learn a good deal about capital structure, agency, firm behavior, investment models, bankruptcy, public policy, and finance more generally. That said, take it only if you have an interest in these subjects. I certainly did, and I found the material interesting. Effi will not be teaching it next year. He was a mediocre lecturer and seemed obsessed with incentives that rewarded not genuine interest, but actions just to gain bounty.","Interesting material. But not as quantitative as Capital Markets (Ec 1723), especially the second half of the course. So if you want to do more quantitative finance. Then I recommend 1723 to this one. If you want to do banking though, this is a more important one.","take it only if you are really interested in finance and can't learn it on your own. if you just want to have some basic background in finance, it's not worth it","The material is really usefull while the course is average.","I would tell students to take this course if they absolutely have to.  Otherwise, capital markets is a much better course.  If students are interested in learning more about valuation (which capital markets does not teach), it is easier just to pick up a book to read about it.","Effi is fun, but mumbles and has a thick accent - read the textbook for your information.\r\n\r\nFinal exams are recycled from years previous intentionally to ensure that you study previous exams - the best study strategy is to copy the solutions to those exams onto your one page of allowed notes.  Then, go get a beer.","Great introduction to corporate finance. Can often be very theoretical.","Every student should be required to take this class.  You learn more about economics and business than any other class I've taken these past 4 years.","Definitely take this class! It's one of the most useful classes I've taken here. You don't need any previous finance background to successfully navigate the material. Effi's a great professor - definitely try to get to know him outside of class.","the prof is really poor.","Great class for learning the basic theories of corporate finance, essential knowledge for pursuing a finance or related field.  However, plan on teaching yourself most of the time.","The class is by far one of the worst classes I've taken at Harvard. The teaching is dismal. You have next to no support from TFs in the class. And the exams do not cover what is actually taught.","Don't come into this course with high expectations. You'll learn some theories of capital structure and that's it.","This course was amazing.","You could learn all the material in this course in about a day. The lectures were also not very relevant to the material.","Professor Benmelech is great.","take this class only if you are interested in pursuing finance as a job","study a lot on your own","be prepared to learn a lot of the material on your own.","be prepared to work hard, but it is a good class","Good class. Interesting and useful content, and not that hard.","pretty easy but can be competitive because so many people take it. lecture is very boring and it's hard to stay awake or pay attention because Professor Benmelech has no stage presence and makes it hard to identify what is important. you don't need to go to lecture really - just read them and do the problem sets to learn how to do everything for the exams","If you are interested in economics and business you need to take it.","Don't go to lectures.","This class is mostly interesting to people who want to explore finance. For everyone else, I would suggest taking another course to fulfill requirements.","This course prepares you very well for a summer in banking, either having that experience already or having taken capital markets would be extremely helpful.  The answers to the exams are all based off of old exams, so put those on your cheat sheet.","you should work hard. it's not as easy as you think. in fact, it's quite challenging, esp. you need to motivate yourself to go to class.","an interest in finance is a must. also, everyone who takes the class is probably going into ibanking or consulting.","Be prepared to do a lot of work.","good introduction for those interested in finance","Great!","It is very useful in learning the basics of finance, especially if you have no previous background.","a fast but fun exploration into the essential topics of corporate finance","ALWAYS USE THE NPV RULE","I would recommend the class, but I thought it was very easy and didn't teach a lot of substantial material. I knew a lot of what was taught already from having prepared for finance interviews. There's a lot of overlap with basic finance and economic ideas.","Lots of work, but definitely worth the time! If you want to understand corporate finance (the intuition behind the formulas) then definitely take this course!","professor's not good.","Attending lecture, especially at the beginning, is necessary to pass this class. Know the problem sets inside and out for the midterm and final.","This class is extremely boring and no matter how hard you work if you don't have finance experience you won't do well. Don't take this class.","The curriculum is applicable, but not very interesting.","You learn some essential skills in this class, whether you intend to go into finance or not. And it's not difficult."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["The way the course was taught this year was geared towards future practitioners in the finance industry. If you want to go into finance, this is like Investment Banking 101, and you will learn a lot and enjoy the course. However, you won't learn much about the corporate governance or crisis applications of corporate finance. It was a visiting professor, though, so it's hard to extrapolate for future years.","Plenty of interesting topics covered in this course.  It starts off very slowly, but picks up pace about halfway through.  The assignments and exams are not super difficult but you definitely have to be careful not to make silly errors.","This is a great class if you are unsure about going into finance. It teaches you a lot and in depth. If you are not interested in finance, do not take this class. It is hard, but go to the tfs for help.","not finance-y enough in the quant sense, but introduces students to a lot of interesting areas of economic research on corporate finance & governance","Good way to learn about Corporate Finance, although it's difficult to motivate oneself to attend lecture when the lecture notes are comprehensive.","Great exposure to corporate finance. Difficult tests and problem sets, worth it in the long run","This class is a little redundant and spends too much time on the minutiae of corporate finance. No one really gets very excited about it.","I would take this as a way to fulfil a requirement, but many of the things are learnable on your own.","This is a difficult course (or at least it was this year), and a bit disorganized. But the material is interesting and useful if you go into finance.","Among all the economics classes I took so far, this was the most engaging one. I felt I learned a lot of applicable economics.","this class is A LOT of work if you want to do well.","It is a decent course and great to tell recruiters, but it doesn't teach a lot of info that you can't teach yourself. It can all be learned in a financial internship or student group like HFAC. It is almost all straight forward common sense type stuff.","This is a very useful class. It is very disorganized, however, and very much dependent on memorization skills. There is a lot of ambiguity regarding which methods\/formulas you should use in which situations. Overall, it would have been better if the TF's and the professor had been more consistent in their approach to the material.","If you're interested in financial markets, this class will significantly help you understand the Wall Street Journal.","take this course if you want to work in finance!","It's hard. Don't mess around with it.","The most boring class I've ever taken. Also, the professor is a big douche.","It is ridiculous. The final doesn't reflect the midterm or practice tests. It focuses on minor details. Also, it is ridiculous that they don't allow graphing calculators for the test. I was shocked when I had to buy a $10 calculator.","Take this class if you are interested in finance, or need it for an internship. It is very focused on practical applications.","If you have not had any exposure to finance before, then this class will be really interesting and definitely worth your while.","IT is hard because of the exams. Knowing economics is useful for the course.","I would recommend this course if the same professor was teaching it. Otherwise, I think it would be very dry. The way the lecture is conducted is of utmost importance.","This course is a refreshing dose of practicality compared to the purely theoretical economic classes you have taken before","Only take this course if you are interested in corporate finance. perhaps pretty useful for interview prep too, but if you are taking this course for \"prepping for the summer\/FT work\", doesn't really help work-wise.","No need to go to lecture as the notes provide a comprehensive review of class discussion.","Take it with Elias!  He is AMAZING and explains things in a very practical and engaging way.  Cold calls in class can be intimidating but is a great way to memorize important ideas and really internalize the concepts.","This class isn't super well taught, but it's the closest you can get to Finance at Harvard other than Capital Markets.","It is tough. Structure of midterm and final were very different and they were also different than the problem sets.","It's a good class to have, though sometimes lectures were difficult to understand.","It's practical, but you're better off just reading a book.  The professor is very arrogant.  The homeworks don't help and there is no push for you to do problems.  Groups that turn in 1 hw?  That's ridiculous.  And we never do problems in section.  We just listen to the TF\"s talk about examples, which dones't help.  It's a horribly structured class, the worst I've experienced at Harvard.  Worst ever.  And I am usually a very easygoing person","I strongly advise you to have a small and efficient team before signing up for this course (because of Problem Sets and Group Project). Be prepared to do a lot of studying on your own, reading the book and going to lecture will not necessarily be enough. You will have to develop a deeper understanding of Corporate Finance (by reading the news or googling stuff). Exams are unnecessarily tough. As the professor said \"You either got it at the end of the term, or you didn't.\"","Great material to learn.","The current professor lectures in a very confusing manner. Just make sure you know the material well.","Very good for ib interview prep","Be sure to set aside plenty of time to read the book and make sure you know the material better than it is covered in lecture"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Terrible course, terrible lecturer, and terrible material. If you have any respect for economics, don't take this course. It's designed for pre-professional financiers and should not be listed among the department's courses.","I'm glad I know these concepts and some of the theory behind. On the other hand, I don't expect to ever need to calculate an IRR by hand, nor to have to be able to derive anything related to Macauley duration.","worst lecture ever.  highly unorganized.  terdious and will not inspire you to do anything in finance.","Definitely useful, but not particularly well taught.","I'll start with the most useful advice - Effi reuses problems.  I had 5 of 18 final exam questions on my 1 page crib sheet.  Do the same.      As a junior going into an investment banking internship, I figured the course would be useful, relevant, and interesting.  I was right - the course, while not an investment banking training camp, taught me a lot of things that I should definitely know.  Here's why I chose \"Definitely not recommend\": This course (run by Effi Benmelech) is hideously disorganized.   The lectures are brutal, no one goes, the homeworks aren't even glanced at, the grades seem arbitrary at times, and the teaching staff couldn't care less about this course.  The laziness is brutal.  The typos on the solutions to practice exams will set you back about 30 hours studying, as every problem will take time to decipher, leaving you wondering what the answer really is.","You must be very self-driven in order to get anything significant out of the course. There is a lot of good material to learn if you are interested in going into finance; however, the course is not very organized and therefore you must teach yourself a lot of the stuff.","I had zero experience with finance\/banking before taking this class, and I sometimes felt like I was a step behind. I mean the people in this class are a self-selecting crowd, and I think in order to take this class, you need a reason (other than saying that this class needs to fulfill a concentration requirements, for example). I took it because I wanted to be challenged, and because I wanted to be exposed to something that I think is interesting and something that I've never been exposed to before. And because of that, I'm glad I took the class, but I can definitely see how some people would hate this class.","This is one of the most applicable classes at Harvard. Can be a little difficult at times and a little stressful (the final can be worth 70% of your grade), but I would definitely recommend it!","If the same professor teaches it, no need to go to lecture. Lectures are for the most part verbatim to the textbook, and they are hard to understand anyways. Be prepared to spend some outside class time to learn this stuff on your own, but if you are considering a career in finance, this is must-know basic knowledge","Effi clearly doesn't want to teach this class. Point is moot since he's not teaching it next year anyway. Also, be prepared to learn this material entirely on your own. That being said, everyone going into finance should know this material cold in either case.","The math requirement is bs. Make sure to put all the questions you do not know how to solve on the cheat sheet!","Quite a few different lecturers have given the course over the years. Your experience will probably be different with different lecturers. Make sure you take that into account when you look at q scores and such.","Do not take this course - Professor Benmelech is perhaps the most incomprehensible and condescending instructor I have encountered at Harvard.","Only take it if you find it really useful. prof is not good. Lectures are boring. Solution guides have incorrect answers. Seems like teaching staff couldn't care less. Typos in the solutions are mistakes when they are consequential to the answer --> Apparently he doesn't think this is the case. Waste of time.","There are so many better electives you could take. The course is poorly organized and poorly taught.","Section with Anna was great - she explains everything clearly!","Obviously, if you want to go into business or finance this is a helpful class to take, and you probably should take it.  That being said, it's not the most well organized course and it can be pretty difficult-not the psets, but definitely when the midterm and exam come around.  Section isn't well integrated into the course so it's not that helpful.  However, Effi is really fun once you get used to him and he has a lot of interesting things to say, especially toward the end of the course when you get past the basics.","mainly for students to go through during recruiting - super helpful for the process","It was very tough and poorly organized, but the stuff you learn here will help you for the rest of your life.","A completely OK class, although it does not have a distinct profile. Mixes introductory themes with some unnecessary detailed research.","Very interesting content. One of the few courses available at Harvard that are considerably relevant to a career in the financial services industry.\r\nClosely aligned with a thorough, comprehensive, easy-to-understand textbook\r\nPowerpoint slides are concrete, focused, and easy to follow\r\nProfessor and TFs (Vladimir specifically) do a good job of generating enthusiasm towards material","Do not take it when Effi is teaching it.  Effi is extremely arrogant, who has no basis to do so.  He is more arrogant than some of the all-star professors of economics, which does not include him.  He is barely understandable with his accent and his lectures and lecture notes are not very helpful.","lol... just lol.","Only take this course if you have a reason to take a finance course! It's extremely helpful and you learn a lot, but it's painful.","Useful class and interesting material, but lectures can get pretty boring","This is a great introduction to the theory of \"finance.\" The word \"finance\" is tossed around a lot here, so it behooves you to study up on the fundamentals. This course is tricky and the exams aren't easy, but you'll come away from it with a valuable toolbox - and the ability to do simple valuations. If you aren't too savvy in finance, this is a must-take.","interesting course if you want to wet your feet in corporate finance, but poorly taught. sections aren't very useful, many typos on practice exam solutions (and even this year's midterm), etc. concepts are taught well in class, but the problems on the exams are very convoluted so you have to teach yourself with very little instructor support","This class was definitely very useful for anyone interested in finance. It gives you a great fundamental understanding of how finance works within firms. I definitely learned a lot from this course. It's not exactly easy because a lot of your grade depends on the midterm and final, but overall a very useful course. Effie also really knows his stuff.","Not an easy class, you should have some finance background to take this class. The problem sets are the most important component of this course.","I would definitely not recommend this course unless there are some major changes. The course tries to squeeze in too much material in one semester. At the same time, the course is very inefficiently run and the professor\/TFs seem like they put in very little to absolutely no effort in the class. The professor simply reads from his slides for an hour and a half at each lecture, which makes sitting through lecture difficult. The TFs don't do ANYTHING. It would've been helpful if they used section times to go over course material instead of going over solutions to problem sets (solutions to which are posted online promptly after the due dates...). The TFs are also not very helpful outside of class, and they were also late to the final exam... Overall, I had a pretty negative experience."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["go to lecture, read lecture notes","Take it if you want something on your resume to show employers.","Definitely a must-take for anyone interested in investment banking. Material is very relevant to the financial services sector. Professor Lamont is great. This class has DEFINITELY been a significant improvement from previous years. Not too difficult. Exams are enjoyable. Problem sets are tedious at times.","The college switched up the professor in hopes of improving the course. While better, it has only improved marginally. The professor is a great lecturer, but that's where the benefits of the course stops. The TF quality needs to improve, the curve is very harsh, homework assignments are not properly graded, and the material advances much too fast. Come in with prior finance background or you'll find yourself underprepared.","The class is extremely dependent on midterm\/final grades.","Definitely more relevant to investment banking than capital markets, though both are great classes to take if you're interested in finance. Prof. Lamont is super funny, a great lecturer and very approachable. You will not learn how to model, but you will actually learn to think about the things you may learn in a Vault banking interview guide rather than becoming a robot. Final was pretty hard, but this was a really good course. Take it. Also, the math pre-req shouldn't be there, don't let that stop you if you're interested.","The math is very difficult!","Very good class for those interested in finance.","A very well taught class where you will enjoy going to class a lot.","This is a fairly taught but difficult class, I would consider taking it pass\/fair if you have no experience with finance. Professor Lamont is an engaging and effective lecturer, but one certainly needs to stay on top of the material before it's two nights before the midterm and you're scrambling.","Decent class as an overview of Corporate Finance, but don't expect it to be challenging or teach you anything all that fascinating.","If you are even remotely interested in finance, this course is a must. Lamont is a great lecturer. Idk if he is teaching it next year though.","This course is rewarding but difficult. Professor Lamont is great, and extremely knowledgeable, and very accessible outside of class. However, definitely more time consuming than a typical economics course.","This class is like Defense Against the Dark Arts. New professor every year, and this year was not a Professor Lupin year. The course was poorly organized, and Lamont goes off on weird tangents\/making side comments that don't necessarily  make sense all the time. Problem sets were not that helpful for the exams, and I felt like I was just doing random things since they're not graded. So in short, lecture was not useful, the midterm was not reflective of lecture material\/homework, but the final was ok. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this class; even though you might think you need to take it to be a banker\/consultant, I know of plenty of successful people who didn't take it. I found it unnecessarily confusing.","This is a pretty interesting class for those who want to go into finance.","take it with lamont.","This course moves fairly quickly, and can be a bit tough especially as you learn the terms and way of thinking. By the midterm, I hadn't gotten there, but by the end, I felt I had a great grasp and that the course gave it to me.  (Unfortunately, there are few assessments, and the midterm's weighted heavily.) Above all, though, Prof. Lamont was a great lecturer, both funny and informative. His lectures were the best part of this course.","Good class to take if you're going into finance\/have experience playing around with stocks and are interested in the sector or follow many companies. Not interesting at all unless you're invested in the material in some way because it's a boring subject until the professor starts talking about case studies of real companies but by then it is hard to separate what happens in reality from what is\/how to record things on paper financially.","This class is interesting at times, but not as well-taught as I expected. We seem to just read and zoom through lectures, without spending enough time on them. Also, a lot of the problems could be interpreted in different ways, so one must clearly state assumptions.","This is a great course for economics concentrators, because it gives valuable insight about financial decisions that firms face. It gives a great impression of what an MBA course on corporate finance might look like. Homework assignments are appropriate in length and never too hard. The only downside to this course has been the harsh grading of the midterm, which is curved around a B-. Taking the course pass\/fail or investing a lot of time in the easy practice problems can help avoid getting anything below a B+ in this course.","Don't be intimidated by the pace of the lecture and all the pre-finance people in there who throw around random finance terms. \r\nThe practice problems at the end of lecture slides actually help with the homework. If you can do the homework, the tests are relatively straightforward.","Great class, difficult, but you learn a ton.","Lots of great personal anecdotes, pretty painless, you learn a lot and its not terribly hard.","Professor Lamont is great, he gives engaging lectures and occasionally makes jokes. He seemed intimidating at first but later in the semester he seemed like a funny & friendly person.\r\nGreat course to take in preparation for a summer internship on Wall Street.","Its easy. Take it.","Very easy if you have professional experience in the subject.","If you want to learn finance, this is a must.","This course can get very rough, especially the homework. Be prepared.","Lamont is clearly intelligent, but not always comprehensive or coherent in his teaching--more interested in chugging through the material than teaching it in a way that makes sense.","BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE CURVE!! Simple statistics: for the midterm (which accounts for 30-40% of your grade), the mean is 51 out of 80, the standard deviation is 13, and the threshold for A minus is 63, a full std above average. If you are below 45, you get a C or lower (which is like 30% of the class...) I would expect something similar for the final.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to go into banking, it's kind of a tradition to take this course. There is only one or two courses at Harvard that has the word \"finance\" in their description anyways.","Don't be fooled by the fact that psets are graded so easily - exams, which make up 90% of your grade, will be graded harshly! Be prepared to be on your own as there isn't much participation of section leaders in this course. I learned a lot and the material is interesting, but the class can be organized and taught much better.","If you are interested in finance, this is a must-take course.","The final was easier than expected, but I did think the midterm was somewhat difficult. Read the book, do the problems, and keep up and you'll be fine.","solid useful class.","The grading distribution could be better (90% of your grade is based on a midterm and final) but this class isn't too difficult content-wise. Professor Lamont provides you with all of the material you need to do well on the test, so it's up to you to study as much (or as little) as you want.","1745 really gave me the foundations to a good understanding of how to evaluate firms","You're pretty much on your own--there's little support from the TF's or professor (though professor Lamont's two review sheets were admittedly very helpful for the final)","It's an easy class. Take it if you want an easy A. Don't take it if you expect to learn anything substantial about finance.","If you really want to learn about corporate finance, then consider taking this course. However, be forewarned that you will probably be learning the material primarily by reading the textbook and scanning the lecture notes provided online rather than by gleaning much from the actual lectures themselves.","Good class. Pretty fair. Brutal Midterm, Way easy final. Study the concepts, lectures are funny, Lamont is pretty good.","Professor Lamont is hilarious. Take this class. You learn so much about corporate finance, and it is in the most painless way possible. I feel like I learned so much in such a short time, but didn't have to stress and struggle to do so."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class was taught by a visiting professor, so I'm not sure how this class will be next year. This year, the material was relatively easy, but lectures were just reading off of slides and things that you didn't understand were not going to be explained beyond that. Solutions to problem sets and exams often just said the answer and didn't explain the steps, so those weren't very helpful either. Course materials were kind of disorganized.","This class was a disaster. The professor is not an effective lecturer and just drags the class on. The materials are confusing and the lecture notes do not really seem to help with anything.\r\n\r\nWould not recommend, at least not with this professor.","Great material. If you're interested in finance take it.","It was difficult to understand the professor most of the time. He tried hard during lecture, and I could tell he was presenting his ideas clearly, but it just didn't get through to me. He also refused to help on problem set questions (or with any type of question relating to those on the problem set) during his office hours. That said, I took it pass\/fail, I think I nailed the final on only a day or two of studying, and I may or may not be mildly inebriated rightnowwoohooseniorspranggggggg","It really depends on who is teaching the course next year.","You'll probably see that most had an easy time this year.  This is heavily dependent upon the professor.  Don't only look at the evaluations this year.","A very practical and useful course.","Well taught, but a little repetitive with the material in capital markets.","This class has fascinating material, but I recommend taking it when Prof. Lamont teaches it. This year's professor was good, but he basically taught from the textbook and doesn't seem to have the real world experience that Lamont can offer. Also, exams were graded harshly - they would drag through arithmetic errors to the entire problem, which is ridiculous.","Very easy and very applicable.","Great class to learn about the basics of corporate finance and useful background to have for investment banking \/ consulting. The class depends entirely on the professor; prof. Panunzi was really good, but if it's a different professor, it could become a lot harder (we weren't really able to solve any of the questions from last year's exams for example). In this case, the professor really defines whether the class will be enjoyable or an even more difficult version of capital markets.","There is nothing good that I could possibly say about this class. It is a disgrace to this institution and felt nothing like a Harvard class. Literally none of the teaching staff spoke English as their native language, which severely impaired the learning of the students. The material was watered down, oversimplified, and easy, yet the inexplicably idiotic grading of the midterm screwed over 75% of the students. For some reason unknown to anyone, the teaching staff thought it would be a good idea to outsource the grading of the first midterm to two grad students with no affiliation to the class. Consequently, no partial credit of any kind was awarded for any problems, which meant a student who made a simple arithmetic error or copied down the given information wrong on part a) of question 1 of a 4-question exam, each with parts a) through e), automatically got no higher than a 75% on the exam, even if literally all the other calculations were correct. 25% of students got 100% on the midterm, but the mean was still a 73% with a standard deviation of 23%, which should have alerted the teaching staff to the fact that they were doing something horribly wrong. Lecture was reading through powerpoints, which were mostly copied from the textbook, as were many of the problem set questions. The guest lecturer professor deferred almost all questions from students to his TF's and flew back to Italy before reading period even started. It was painfully obvious that none of the teaching staff cared the slightest bit about the students. It's sad that such an interesting topic could spawn such an abomination of a class.","You must take this course as an economics concentrator!!","Quality of class highly depends on professor teaching the class.","practical, easy to understand lectures","It is a very easy course if you are slightly familiar with the area and have some (rudimentary) math\/ stat background. Take it if you want a relaxed class.","The lectures are good as they follow the material quite closely. The problem sets are fair and help you prepare for the exam. The professor really cared about his students understanding the material, which is somewhat uncommon. The material itself is not too complicated, but gives you a basic foundation in corporate finance.","It's not the best class - pretty dry and not engaging but if you really want to learn the basics of finance, take the class","great class to take, very useful for real world","This class is full of difficult material and one of the few that introduces finance concepts to the Harvard student body. It can move very quickly at times and the exams are worth the vast majority of the grade.","This is a great course if you want to gain some basic knowledge of corporate finance.","No reason to attend lecture when it covers a reading you can do in 20 mins","If you're gonna take it, take it as a 5th class.","It is definitely a class where you learn material that is applicable, but the teaching staff cannot speak English very well. For our final, we had many mistakes on the written exam that greatly affected the way you would answer questions.","I learned a ton in Corp Fin. This class is about how much you put into it. There s a lot of material covered, and if you spend a lot of time doing the readings, attending lectures, studying the week's material, you will learn an incredible amount! For those of you who are taking this course because you are interested in a career in finance, this class is investment banking 101 and more (teaches you wayyy more than what is required for interviews). Overall, a great course for those interested in both the academic and practical sides of finance.","Very helpful class if you want an intro to finance.","It is useful and completely doable.","It's not an easy class, but keep up with the material, go to lecture, and it's not so bad.","If you took Economics 1723 (Capital Markets), this class is going to be about 75% review and 25% new information. The lectures are alright, and the textbook is pretty good. The problem sets and exams are very straightforward and easier than problems from 1723.","If you're interested in finance at all, or are going to be having finance interviews next year, this is a useful course, in the sense that it makes you more aware of and gives you a good grounding in a lot of terms and mechanisms that you often hear swirling around on investing sites online, in the Financial Times, and so on. To be fair, the stuff relevant to finance interviews that you learn from this course you could probably learn in a few days of intensive self-study over the summer, but nevertheless if you're into finance\/ going to be preparing for interviews in the near future, it's a nice bonus to have a solid understanding of how corporate finance works going into your junior year. The difficulty of the course seems to sway a lot each year so be warned.","If you're good at math this course is a breeze, and if you like finance then the material covered is essential to much of IBD & PE.","Exams are hard but lectures are very good. Not much work and you learn a lot of very applicable information."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"1.70","difficulty":"2.70","recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"111","response rate":"72.97","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1745","course_id":"1001","cat_num":"5889","1s":"4","2s":"9","3s":"27","4s":"31","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1745","course_id":"1001","cat_num":"5889","1s":"12","2s":"21","3s":"30","4s":"12","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1745","course_id":"1001","cat_num":"5889","1s":"32","2s":"38","3s":"9","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
