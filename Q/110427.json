Helps you develop your position on free speech and helps you gain a much more nuanced understanding of all the issues that surround it.","This class really changes the way one sees and understands the freedom of speech. The class expands the definition of the first amendment, showing it in its true diversity and breadth of influence. Professor Ungar was excellent, extremely dedicated to the class - flying in every week to teach the course - and was always ready to meet with us if we had questions or anything we wanted to talk about. Do the readings, try your best on the essays, and speak up during class! It's a great course to take but you get out what you put in!","Take this class. Professor Ungar is an amazing teacher and a very cool person. The discussions each week are thought provoking and the topics we cover controversial. This is a great way to spend your first semester, but do be sure you are interested in a lot of discussion!","Engaging in the conversation greatly enhances the in-class experience, but listening is also equally as scintillating sometimes. Doing the weekly readings was very manageable and rewarding, and searching for supplementary cases and information is also rewarding.","Professor Ungar genuinely cares about his class and his student.  He is deeply passionate and knowledgable about free speech and encourages the same enthusiasm in his students.  Most rewarding class I took.  It would be shame to miss out on an incredible course and professor.","This class was a wonderful weekly debate on the freedom of speech in different contexts, and perfect for anyone with a passion for constitutional law or government in general.","Until you study free speech you will take for granted the freedoms we are give. In addition to this you'll see how difficult some free speech issues are to resolve","Definitely take this class!","Best choice you can make Freshman Fall.","This is a great Freshman Seminar. Professor Ungar is great and the material is really interesting. The workload is completely manageable and you'll learn a lot about free speech.","If you have any interest in government or law (which I hope is almost everyone), you should do everything you can to take this course. Great environment to think about First Amendment ideas and controversies."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"3.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"15","response rate":"93.33","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 40l","course_id":"12377","cat_num":"48874","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 40l","course_id":"12377","cat_num":"48874","1s":"4","2s":"7","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
