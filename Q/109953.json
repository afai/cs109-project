It is not one where you need to be interested in the humanities (I'm interested in science) to appreciate the texts.  There is great diversity in the assigned readings\/films.  Both a philosophical and a concrete approach to what makes something beautiful are used.  The course load was perfect for a freshman seminar class (not too light, but not too heavy).","Lots of reading but all interesting.","I loved the freedom of this class. It's a great seminar because it feeds you interesting information in such a wonderful manner,and Professor Scarry is so wise on the subject.","The readings touch upon many subjects ranging from Plato to works of the Middle Ages and present."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"4","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"FRSEMR 39n","course_id":"10828","cat_num":"18472","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"FRSEMR 39n","course_id":"10828","cat_num":"18472","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"FRSEMR 39n","course_id":"10828","cat_num":"18472","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
