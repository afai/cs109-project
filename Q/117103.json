However, he goes on frustrating tangents just as frequently, so beware.","Very interesting course. Prof. Chierchia is very enthusiastic. Lecture notes can be a bit unclear at times, but Chierchia's \"Meaning and Grammar\", and Heim and Kratzer's \"Semantics in Generative Grammar\" are very helpful supplements. Course prepares you well for current literature in semantics. Assignments are not a lot of work, and final squib is interesting to write.","This is an excellent course in semantics. Gennaro is a fantastic instructor who will always make the time to ensure that every student understands the difficult material.","The course is very good for grounding your understanding of semantics. It is a very difficult field but reveals a lot of interesting problems of mapping language to logic. Class can be difficult and confusing because the material is difficult, but ask questions in class as much as you can and meet with Professor Chierchia one-on-one if you are confused as he is extremely helpful and accommodating."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"6","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"LING 216","course_id":"2816","cat_num":"8812","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"LING 216","course_id":"2816","cat_num":"8812","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"LING 216","course_id":"2816","cat_num":"8812","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
