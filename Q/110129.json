If not, it's just another mandatory expos class.","It was hard as can be.","This Expos is stellar. The teaching is superb, the course material is interesting and provides a break from the average freshman's introductory class coursework, and the class discussions are always so productive. I highly recommend Dr. Becker and the way he introduces the Harvard freshman to college writing.","Although I wouldn't typically close readings of literature and film to be my cup of tea, I really enjoyed this course. Dr. Becker is very thorough and helpful, the material is interesting, and our group of 15 students got along well and had lively discussions. Don't go into this class thinking it will be easy, though, especially if you have no prior background writing papers on films or doing close readings. Putting in effort into this class will be rewarding!","I you are interested in uncovering the way in which white abolitionist's influenced the \"authentic\" slave narratives and analyzing the tools that film directors and authors utilize to convey certain character traits in the slave narrative genre, then this course may be for you.","Expos is one of those necessary evils that all Harvard students must face. I must say that most students that I talk to do not enjoy the course. However, I think my experience was considerably better than that of my peers for having this particular expos section. Dr. Becker is amazing, and he goes out of his way to ensure that students do the best that they can.","Dr. Becker is a great professor. You will walk away from his class having a lot of respect for the way that he handles the course. Slave Narratives is a very interesting topic and the readings give you a lot to learn and talk about.","You'll have a great time! At times it can be difficult to adjust to a more literary analysis perspective of writing since it is literature based but it enhances your skills in that area.","Slave Narratives is a great expos. Simple as that. You will be doing a lot of analytical writing on texts and some film (Django Unchained). There is some reading, but none of the reading is superfluous. I think the reading to writing ratio balance was great in this course. My advice to anyone taking expos in general: spend of a lot of time thinking. Try to attack your ideas from many different angles before you start writing.","Among the best expos, as best I can tell","Dr. Becker is a very good teacher. He knows exactly what it is he's teaching, and is a master of the style and method of writing he is teaching. This class will be whatever you make of it, but it will require work and a good deal of focus to do well in."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"15","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"EXPOS 20.235","course_id":"11311","cat_num":"67053","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"5","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"EXPOS 20.235","course_id":"11311","cat_num":"67053","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"EXPOS 20.235","course_id":"11311","cat_num":"67053","1s":"2","2s":"8","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
