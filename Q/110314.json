Those who are interested in doing a meaningful interdisciplinary engagement should take this class.","Despite the minor shortcoming listed above, this was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. I would be very interested in pursuing the concentration if it is offered in the future.","I probably did the most intellectual work in this class out of all the classes I took this year. I never wanted to shortchange the readings and always came to class excited to hear the professors' takes on the readings and the opinions of fellow students. The class teaches historians a lot about anthropology--after this you won't find the theoretical parts of their  articles quite so difficult to read. It also provides a great background in the discipline of history. Dr. Brown in particular is interested in intellectual biographies, which is very helpful for learning more about our discipline.","This is a beautifully and thoughtfully crafted course which sparks a very meaningful dialogue between the two disciplines. Not only does one get familiar with works of historians and anthropologists  who have used inter-disciplinary methods, the assignments in class demand such an engagement by the student. If anyone from either discipline is seriously thinking of using methods  of the other, this course is a must.","Be prepared to work very hard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"3.80","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 2725","course_id":"11454","cat_num":"48056","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 2725","course_id":"11454","cat_num":"48056","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 2725","course_id":"11454","cat_num":"48056","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
