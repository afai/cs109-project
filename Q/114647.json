'10":{"comments":["It's not for everyone...personally I found that i'm much more interested in film history than theory, so the course was a little abstract\/ungrounded in real documents for me.","the film tradition that lead to modern Hollywood blockbusters is very interesting... I was semi-skeptical about theorizing things that are part-entertainment  part-art, but this course left me with a much deeper and subtle appreciation for all types of films.","The readings are a major component to this course. If you're willing to sit down and do all of them then you'll get a lot out of this course","really interesting if you like theory, prof. bruno's excellent"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It's okay--the material is really interesting sometimes but it needed to be taught in a much more structured way for undergrads who have never looked at theory before to fully understand. It was film theory ideas from the perspective of Bruno's work, presented in a straight-up lecture format with a mid-term and final paper, and nothing else really. If you want to engage with the material, you really have to do it on your own, which can be hard given how dense the writing is in this field.","This is a course which will challenge how you think but give you room to grow in theoretical expression and argument! Its also a great course for accessing great writing and working on your own writing style.","Look at the syllabus, do the readings that interest you, don't take the course","It's interesting if you want to see film from a new perspective, but be prepared for what you're getting into. The reading list is dense and immense, but it's not hugely necessary to understand what's going on","This course opens up a wide variety of thinking methods and avenues for interdisciplinary research in the humanities. Professor Bruno is brilliant, and Zach is just the most wonderful TF you can get. There will be a lot of readings, they will be difficult; but this course has been the most intellectually enriching and inspiring course i have taken at harvard."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 181","course_id":"5229","cat_num":"0648","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 181","course_id":"5229","cat_num":"0648","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"4","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 181","course_id":"5229","cat_num":"0648","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
