Honestly, a lot of the time this class was an exercise in frustration (particularly being assigned difficult problems on material we covered only briefly in lecture, or hearing the same topic multiple times while other important topics were never covered). Even the final had a question about the probability of observing a lensed galaxy that seemed to have nothing to do with galaxies at all- they were treated like test particles for the sake of the problem.","It's not about galaxies and has little observational stuff.","Your time would be better spent working through Binney and Tremaine and reading a good observational book and review papers.","Even though Avi and Matias tend to start the semester with enthusiasm, it is pretty evident that they loose interest during the semester. As with Cosmology Ay202b, the first month is very interesting and well lectured and with time the lectures seem to become completely disconnected from each other consisting of many random topics of astrophysics.","Read Binney & Tremaine and Padmanabhan.","To have a decent background on galaxies, you need to learn on your own."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["As taught by Professor Huchra, this class is an excellent exposition of the history and present state of extragalactic astronomy.  If you want a deep understanding of the theory behind galaxy dynamics and evolution\/formation, you may be somewhat disappointed, but do not let that deter you, because that topic requires it's own course(s)..","An example of the utter failure of powerpoint lectures in physics classes.","Go in without expecting to learn anything. Try to - but good luck!","I think this would be a great course for someone interested in galaxies and is either doing research in this field or planning to."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["professor eisenstein is a great lecturer and really knows what he's talking about...he is a great resource to learn from in order to get a sense for the present state of research in astrophysics","I was able to pay attention without much effort.","This class provides a very comprehensive overview of the theory and observations involved in galaxies and galactic dynamics. I learned a ton!","A great overview of the current state of the field, with enormous breadth.  Prof. Eisenstein chooses topics that are very relevant to current work.","This course is by far the best course I've taken at Harvard.","Great purview into the relevant topics of galaxies today","You'll get a taste of a range of research topics related to galaxies, but you won't go into particular depth on any one topic.","Eisenstein is a great lecturer for this course, giving a good grounding on the open questions in various subfields of galaxy formation\/dynamics.  Made me excited to explore more areas of galaxy research","Good course, even if you aren't interested in galaxies all that much."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["If you've struggled with this material before (like me), then this class will help you understand things in a much clearer way.","The course provides the cosmological foundation for understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies. Strong connections between observation and theory are made in lecture and assignments. References and motivations for further exploration of topics and open questions are supplied. The galaxies component could be more extensive. Nevertheless, the coverage they did receive will lead naturally into the companion course (Cosmology) in the winter semester. An ideal course for observers and theorists alike.","Daniel Eisenstein's lectures are top-notch.  Paper in lieu of final.","This is a great class; Prof. Eisenstein is a great lecturer and you will learn a lot.","Prof Eisenstein, as everybody has already known, is great in teaching. This is a must-take course.","This course is great with Eisenstein. He is a master at explaining concepts in a clear way and makes it seem so easy. The course should be mandatory like it used to be. Any astronomy grad student should have cosmology under her\/his belt."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.00","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"21","response rate":"76.19","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ASTRON 202a","course_id":"278","cat_num":"8237","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"5","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ASTRON 202a","course_id":"278","cat_num":"8237","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"14","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ASTRON 202a","course_id":"278","cat_num":"8237","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"12","4s":"2","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
