It can be the easiest or hardest course you take, depending on how much effort you put into it. The issues it raises and the final translation project can occupy you for hours on end, or you can forget about them altogether and it doesn't seem to make much difference.","Start work on your commentary early! It can be super rewarding to do a thorough job on your translation and commentary.","This course will change the way you think about communication in every aspect\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth as conducted in your own native language as well as the romance languages you'll study\/translate\/etc. throughout the semester. I can't imagine anyone walking away from this course and wishing they hadn't taken it.","This course is crucial for those RLL concentrators who wish to pursue or at the very least understand the art of translation and its role in inter-lingual literary dialogue."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you're passionate about a language, this is a great way to be exposed to it in a different way.  You'll definitely have to work harder than many other language (Spanish in my case) courses, but I think it's more rewarding b\/c of that. \r\n\r\nThe professor is great and very helpful, and it's fun to have someone who gets as excited as you about the work you are doing.","AMAZING course! Definitely take it if you have time\/interest.  The subject is fascinating and the course is well organized and extremely well run.  Prof Di Fabio is excellent.","This was a phenomenal class! The readings are fascinating and the work is challenging in the very best way. This class was such a success for me, I think, because my peers and I enrolled for the same reason that Prof. di Fabio taught it: we are all genuinely interested in the discipline. Our shared enthusiasm for the material made it scarcely feel like work, especially during class when we workshopped texts. I could not more highly recommend this course for students who are interested in meticulous literary analysis.","best course I have taken at Harvard","This class is amazing. All of the work you do is meaningful and class discussions are always interesting.","Professor DiFabio is so approachable and makes translation and translation theory fun. You will learn a lot about your own romance language and the cultural differences that arise from translation. I would highly recommend taking this course.","It is an amazing class with an amazing instructor and it will help you master your language skills."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"2.60","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ROM-STD 101","course_id":"4466","cat_num":"89225","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ROM-STD 101","course_id":"4466","cat_num":"89225","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ROM-STD 101","course_id":"4466","cat_num":"89225","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
