'08":{"comments":["A very useful treatment of electrodynamics.  Everyone could use a good electrodynamics course.","If you liked Physics 16, this is for you: even cooler material, even better problem sets! Note however that you need to be comfortable with multivariable calculus and higher math in general: the mathematical level can be quite formidable at times!","The work is hard, the class is competitive, but it's good fun in the end. You learn the material well.","For physics concentrators.","Although the material is very interesting and well worth studying, it is also important to evaluate whether one is prepared to take the class (especially if considering taking it as a freshman).  It is both difficult and time-consuming.","Don't stress too much about your grade.","I recommend this course to any physics concentrator or other student with a strong math background and interest in the subject. It is difficult and time-consuming but covers an enormous amount of material that gives you a great foundation in electrodynamics and more. The level of the class is far beyond that of Physics 15B, but if you are willing to struggle a bit, the extra knowledge you will gain is well worth the effort.","This course and Griffiths book are an excellent way to improve your understanding of electricity, magnetism, and waves, concepts which are central to all areas of the physical sciences, including physical chemistry.","This course is an intense tour of electrodynamics. What you derive at the end though makes all your hard work worth it, and it really is a great course.","This class is very difficult, but also a great bonding experience. Professor Lukin and the Griffith textbook are both excellent.","This class made me see the beauty of physics.  It is by far the most worthwhile physics course I have ever taken.","If you thought 16 was fun, this will be fun. If you thought 16 was painful, maybe this isn't the right class for you."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Work hard. It's worth it","The material is very important, but the course was not well taught.","This is a definite class you need to take to prepare for grad school in physics.","Professor Hoffman was an excellent instructor for this class.","Very fast paced.","I would recommend this class to students with a strong interest in physics who are willing to work hard.","please read purcell or take 15b first!!","I think the professor will change so I don't think I'll know much. I think people from 16 had lukewarm feelings towards 15b, and I think the textbook for this course is great and it is a doable challenge.","Be willing to work hard and make sure you have a solid background in electricity and magnetism.","It's a big time commitment."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This course is not for the light hearted.. One got to be exposed to adequate level physics before having enough knowledge to deal with the many possible different areas of the course.","By far the worst class I have ever taken at Harvard.  Horribly disorganised, and hardly covered material outside what is taught in 15b.","Unless the lecture notes have been thoroughly updated and fixed (including diagrams and worked example problems added in) then this class is best avoided, especially if you are an engineering student.","If you take this course, just read Griffiths to make sure you actually understand the main ideas.","The material in this course is probably the most important thing you will learn as a physics student.  Take it!","Go for it.  It's not that hard.  It's just going to require that you work at it.  I bet it changes completely with the instructor, though.","You cover material not covered in 15b, so if you want to take an advanced EM course this course is valuable. There are a lot of cool phenomena and elegant theories in the subject. It is likely that the teacher will change next year, so take this year's q scores with a grain of salt. This year's teacher was brilliant but very unconventional and not good at conveying his ideas. In previous years, the course was taught very differently. For example, usually this course follows Griffiths pretty closely, but we barely touched the book. The way the material was presented reminded me of the feynman lectures, which I find to be a difficult way to first learn the material.","If you hate yourself, take it. If you want to get really good at ranting about how terrible your professor is and how much money your wasting by taking a course, take it. If you want to convince yourself never to physics again, this is probably just what you need to throw you over the edge. If your actually considering a future in physics, or you simply value your sanity, stay away. Stay very far away.","If you are interested in this class, it would be better to take it in a year where Golovchenko is not teaching it."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Golovchenko likes to teach some approaches to electrodynamics topics that are different from the Griffiths explanations.  I thought they were helpful and gave some good intuition for the material, but it may not be what you would expect.","This course can be one of the most rewarding courses you take.  You need to do the textbook reading to understand the basic ideas, but if you do, and you pay attention in class, you will find you're privileged to hear some of the most interesting lectures on physics and electromagnetism that you'll find anywhere.  (Well, I wouldn't know, but probably.)    It's not always easy to follow the professor's unique treatment of various concepts, but you can follow if you try, and you'll learn a lot.  Take any negative reviews with a grain of salt."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Might not be your favorite physics class, but it's very useful, taught in a straightforward fashion, and you'll learn a lot.","Great material...you will really understand classical EM after this course and iron out all of the kinks in understanding from 15b.","Sometimes the calculations can get a little boring, but overall a pretty good class.","This is a fantastic course for anyone who's taken Physics 15b and would like to learn classical electromagnetism in greater depth.  Professor Feldman is a great teacher, and the psets are interesting and informative.  Highly recommended!","This course is really good for getting a solid background in E&M.  Feldman is a really good instructor and you learn a lot from the problem sets.","The problem sets are more tedious and less exciting than in many other upper-level physics classes.  You should take this class if you plan to go to graduate school in physics, but otherwise you might have more fun in another physics class.","If you enjoy E&M and want a more in depth treatment, this is an excellent course!","It was a lot prettier than I though it would be. I'm not sure if this is because of the problems chosen by the professor, or if it is because I had the wrong impression of the subject overall.","This was a great class. I liked having Feldman as a professor and I felt like I learned a lot."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class is a must for anyone concentrating in physics or looking to get exposure to any sort of E&M. You will come away with a thorough understanding of classical electrodynamics at a level significantly deeper than 15b. It's very possible to skip 15b and go straight to this class if you've taken 16 in the fall. All necessary vector calculus is taught in the course. Girma is simply an awesome professor and a really cool person to get to know. If you get the chance to take any class with him don't miss out. This was my favorite class this semester and I'd highly recommend it to everyone. It will never waste your time with the physics, after all the rest is just math.","The material you cover is enormous, and its all at a break-neck pace. Hailu is enthusiastic about teaching you and you will have plenty of opportunity to interact with him in section and even in lecture. His office hours are flexible and helpful. Perhaps the only weakness in this course is the teaching quality, i.e. how concepts are explained and I feel that Hailu may get excited but not explain concepts as well as they could. You'll have to rely on the textbook a lot. Otherwise its quite a difficult class if you haven't taken 15b.","Girma was great, and Griffiths is now one of my favorite physics textbooks. The exams were pretty difficult but fair. I really liked the problems Girma chose for the problem sets, especially the earlier ones. Some of the problems in the later assignments got really messy, but not unbearably so. Great course overall.","If you already know that you are not into electricity and magnetism, then don't go for it. Professor Hailu, despite being an excellent professor in many ways, is hard to follow because he goes at great speed throughout the course. Otherwise, if you are willing to invest a lot of time on your own studying, then it is a very good course.","If you are interested in the theoretical underpinnings of classical electrodynamics, this is the course for you.  Very enlightening and applicable to all sorts of other physics.","Take this class. E&M is a beautiful theory, and Griffiths is a fantastic textbook. There are some darn cool problems involving symmetry arguments and other sweet tricks. It's pretty hard to mess up a class with Griffiths as the backbone.\r\n\r\nAlso this isn't really a comment about 153 in particular, but Girma is awesome. If you ever take a class for which he's the instructor or TF, go talk to him. He'll tell you cool things. I don't understand at all, but apparently when you introduce super symmetry, a bunch of functions become holomorphic, a lot of things are just straightforward residue calculations, and calculations become nice, which is super cool! He has single-handedly managed to make me think physics is super cool again, but it's a bittersweet feeling, because this comes at a time when I'm thinking of moving away from physics, and I won't ever take enough physics to be able to see all these cool things.","This is a solid class. It will vary a great deal depending on who teaches it, but I can imagine most people would benefit from the material covered. If anything, it will get you excited to learn more about the quantum picture after getting a taste of how some classical approximations go bad.","A good one to take. Girma is awesome, take a class with him. 153 is a pretty good way to actually learn E&M.","This is a solid course in electrodynamics, but be warned that it is not easy. If Girma is teaching it, he is awesome especially in office hours so you should go to get help on any problems you are having with the material or the homework- he is really dedicated and ready to help you. There are definitely some tougher parts, and it goes really fast. But you learn a lot by the end of the semester. Because the subject matter is pretty complex, I would recommend it much more strongly to those people with a strong interest in electricity and magnetism already. It's a bit tougher if you don't have that previous interest.","This course with Prof. Hailu was a fantastic treatment of E&M with emphasis on the theoretical development of the theory. The course gives a very complete and intuitive grasp of the material thanks to the fantastic teaching style of the professor. Taking this class with Girma Hailu will be one of the best investments of your time possible. Take this class.","Pretty great follow up to 15b. You come out with a much clearer picture of electricity and magnetism."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["If you took Physics 16 and want to take a more difficult course than 15b, this is the place to be.  The primary difference between this class and 15b is some mathematical maturity.  Professor Lukhin is an excellent professor, the workload is reasonable, and the exams are difficult.  The material is of course superb.  A steady development of electromagnetism to Maxwell's equations followed by a discussion of electromagnetic waves.","Physics 153 is the greatest class I took my freshman spring. If you have Professor Lukin, *definitely* take it (and even if you don't have him, because the subject matter is excellent!). This course will give you a great rundown of electricity and magnetism (with accelerating particles, within and without matter). I took it after taking Physics 16 with only an AP Physics C background in electricity and magnetism, and though the course was challenging, I did well in it. Many others choose to take it sophomore or junior year to make up with they missed in Physics 15b. Excellent course, excellent textbook (Griffiths is great, if you want a bit more mathematical rigor check out Jackson), and excellent professor. Take this course!","extremely interesting material, and very well taught, both lecture and section","This is an excellent course in electromagnetism; it starts off deceptively simple but ends up with quite advanced subject matter (e.g. deriving reflection and refraction directly from Maxwell's equations).  Lukin is a very organized and clear lecturer, as well.  Highly recommended.","Very good class. Lukin is a great prof, and always has real-world examples to go with the concepts you're learning in class. The textbook is excellent. If you took Physics 16 and want another tough physics course, this is a good option.","This course can be difficult, but never insurmountable. I would recommend it to anyone interested in physics (even those not concentrating) with E&M background at the 15b or Physics C level. Peter in particular is phenomenal, and you should definitely take this course if he is TA-ing.","Good course to take if you're interested in the subject matter. Worth taking if Professor Lukin is teaching it or Peter is TFing it.","If Professor Lukin is teaching this course, TAKE IT. He's perhaps one of the clearest lecturers I've had in the physics department and the material is complex and always interesting. The problem sets are mostly from Griffiths--I do wish that there was a more even mix of written and book problems--but you definitely come away with a deeper knowledge of the subject matter regardless.","A very solid class: Professor Lukin's lectures are very clear.","The class itself is challenging, but fun.  Griffiths is a very good textbook to work out of.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't taken Multivariable Calculus, the first few weeks might be a bit challenging.  However, the entire first chapter of Griffiths is devoted to multivar, so playing catch-up isn't too hard (but it is somewhat time-consuming).\r\n\r\nIt is definitely possible to take this course directly after Physics 16\/15a.  It does require more work, but it also provides a deeper understanding of E&M.","This course is really good.  If you liked physics 16, you will love this course: similar level but slightly more focused which makes it easier.  This course covers a lot of hard material but it's so well taught it will feel like nothing - and better yet you learn how to solve real problems like a real physicist (something you don't necessarily realize you haven't been getting until you do).  By the end of the course you will be confidently solving difficult problems you never would have even dreamed of before."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.90","difficulty":"3.60","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"20","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 153","course_id":"4108","cat_num":"0264","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 153","course_id":"4108","cat_num":"0264","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 153","course_id":"4108","cat_num":"0264","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
