You can make your own schedule and people are fun!","Being part of a lab is a valuable experience, but being a research assistant is not especially stimulating intellectually. It's a good way to get a sense of what kind of research goes on in psychology laboratories but the actual running of studies is not especially valuable.","Really cool lab with really great people!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This is a great way to get in-depth experience about psychology and doing science that is completely applicable.","Daniel Gilbert's lab is a bustling atmosphere full of energy and fun discussion of social psychology.

He is extremely personable, and his graduate student Bethany runs the lab meetings both efficiently and with a friendly smile. Best lab ever!!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Working in the Gilbert Lab was a really good experience. I got to participate in all parts of the experiment process, including brainstorming for a follow-up experiment, running the experiment, and preparing a talk about it.","This is a great way to see what psychology research is like from the other side! I really enjoyed working with everyone in the lab as well."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It was such an amazing experience. It definitely requires a lot of time and effort, and is very rewarding. However, make sure that you are willing to put in the requisite amount of time. As long as you are, you will love the course.

Working here was absolutely the best part of my semester. While it's not demanding at baseline, you'll get a lot more out of the experience if you're willing to take on more responsibility and get deeply involved in projects.","This lab is great!

Also if you loved SLS-20 with Gilbert, this is a great opportunity to interact with him and gain even more of his wisdom.","Great course!","This is an excellent lab to be in if you are looking for a rigorous and hands-on, but extremely enjoyable experience with other great and highly motivated students. The lab grants students a lot more freedom than others on campus, but be prepared to hold your own and take a lot of initiative in the research process. Overall, I would highly recommend working here.","The Gilbert lab is awesome! You work under a grad student on whatever line of research needs assistance. The expectations are totally fair and your designated time in the lab can easily be figured out to fit your schedule. If you're lucky like I was, though, most of your time will be spent outside the lab brainstorming\/researching ways to test your hypothesis and creating experiment stimuli. There are weekly journal club discussions where every RA reads the same article(s) and you discuss them as a lab. This helped the lab feel like a community and facilitated everyone getting to know each other and their work. Finally, rather than write a paper, the Gilbert lab has each RA give a PowerPoint presentation at the end of the semester to show Dan and the rest of the RAs and grad students what they worked on. This was a great capstone to an enjoyable semester. If you're thinking about working in a lab at some point, this is a fantastic option!","Incredible learning experience along with not a huge amount of work load."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"6.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"18","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PSY 2580r","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"4262","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"2","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PSY 2580r","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"4262","1s":"3","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PSY 2580r","course_id":"4339","cat_num":"4262","1s":"2","2s":"3","3s":"5","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
