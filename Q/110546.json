on each topic.","This is an excellent course which teaches not only the methods of virology, but also the thought processes a student needs to approach the material. While I have a better understanding of the field than before this course, the greatest benefit I received from this course was the ability to think about and form scientific questions in a more professional manner.","This course is very specialized. I would recommend it for all graduate students who wish to do a PhD in virology but not to those who aren't interested in the subject or are looking for a course that provides an overview of virology. The purpose of this course is to practice proposal writing in this particular field."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["The class was frustrating because it felt like it was four different classes, there were often scheduling problems, and the expectations for what was expected in proposal-writing were inconsistent from syllabus to in-class presentation to personal communication with professors. Also it seemed more like a survey of papers instead of a discussion class which may be more useful for us at this point.","This course is very time-consuming but useful.","Settle on a topic early for the final proposal.  If you keep trying to change it based on feedback you receive, you will spend too much time trying to pick the perfect topic."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is a great preparation class with a lot of writing and reading.","The paper discussions are helpful.

The feedback on this semester long proposal was useless and frustrating."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["It covers viruses, and prepares you for grant writing.","talk with Jim about your proposals even if it is not required,  begin writing your proposals as soon as possible in the semester","Great critical reading class.
