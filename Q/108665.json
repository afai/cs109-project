It is incredible was you can learn about human populations from their genetics and the pull and push factors that influenced their migration storys.","The genetics stuff gets a little boring but it's necessary to understand the roots of migration.  The final presentations are super interesting and professor Tuross is the best.  She's really funny and friendly and knowledgeable.  Her sarcasm is also great.","Professor Tuross is the professor you dream to have in college. Very brilliant and confident. Knows a lot about evolutionary biology and great to engage with. Cares tremendously about her students.","Interesting material, engaging professor, and fair assignments. I took this course to fulfill HEB requirements, although this course could have been counted for other concentrations as well. One word of caution is that the course this year was genetics heavy - and the readings could get overwhelming at times.","Great course!  Dr. Tuross is very friendly and passionate about the topic.  Also, the material is interesting and the amount of course work is just enough to still enjoy the class while also still learning about the topic.","This class was really interesting, and didn't over-load students with work.  Every week, there were readings and a pre-class assignment, and two additional papers.  The final presentations were so interesting, and fun to research.  If you think that you might be interested in the subject matter, definitely take this course.","TAKE IT!!!!! IT WAS AWESOME!!"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Professor Tuross is one of the smartest and funniest professors I've had at Harvard. She is extremely accommodating and kind and even brought us snacks every class! If you have any interest at all in learning about human migration, this is the class for you. The material is presented in an easy manner to comprehend yet you feel as though you've learned an incredible amount of genetics by the end of the semester. The class presentations were the highlight of the course and really allowed the class to become closer and more engaging. Take this class. You will absolutely love it.","I would highly recommend this course to HEB upperclassmen. It's a fairly technical course that could be difficult for an underclassman. Also a solid background in HEB genetics, behavior and evolution would allow a student to make the most of the class. It's a fascinating course about the deep history of the human species. We are not and have never been a static species. It was consistently interesting to both learn about historic migrations that occurred 10 or 30 or 100 thousand years ago, and then to compare those migration factors and evidence to that in much more recent times. Hearing classmates's migration stories was probably the most interesting class day we had.","This class could be retitled \"Human migrations via genetics,\" so if that's what you're expecting then definitely take it. Also, the ancestry\/migration projects were all awesome and incredibly interesting.","This is a fantastic class! The readings are all manageable and the few assignments given help you not only understand migration, but teach you how to write short papers or give short presentations in all fields. Take this class!","It's interesting, and Professor Tuross will teach you to be *very* good at reading papers carefully. And the family research project is plenty of fun. Heartily recommended.","This is the best HEB class I've taken. I looked forward to class every week. The Family Migration project was a highlight of my Harvard coursework. Dr. Tuross is a gem of a professor. It is certainly a class worth taking.","This class was an excellent way to discuss human migration both from a genetics and human narrative. The final family migration project was so much fun to do because it allowed you to explore your our family history and learn about others in your class, which was an incredible opportunity. The class is very relaxed and the seminar component allows you to talk about the papers you read very closely. I learned so much about human genetics and the laboratory methods used to do this type of research. The assigned papers are not difficult to produce and although Professor Tuross is critical of your writing it only helps you improve throughout the semester. I suggest anyone who is remotely interested in human migration and genetics to take this class, especially if you are looking to have a Professor that genuinely loves teaching.","Take this class! It was a great class with an amazing teacher. You won't regret it!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"10","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HEB 1540","course_id":"2748","cat_num":"68708","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"4","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HEB 1540","course_id":"2748","cat_num":"68708","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HEB 1540","course_id":"2748","cat_num":"68708","1s":"2","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
