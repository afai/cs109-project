In my opinion, it's better than taking 153 in its place because even though it does not go into some topics in quite the same depth, it will instead provide you with a very good grand scheme view, which I felt was a little lacking from 16 last semester.","Great funny teacher.  Very effective teacher.  Organized lecture notes.

The material can be pretty tough, but you do learn a lot. Prof Denef also provides for quite amusing lectures.","You'll learn the E&M you need to know in this course. However, this isn't a course to take just for fun.","This course is going to drum E&M into your skull. If you like math and numbers, then that's great, otherwise, it won't be very fun.

There is little integration between lecture and section. Be prepared to learn a lot of the material on your own, suffer long nights in Leverett working on psets, and be unprepared for exams. However, Denef is really nice and is really good at answering conceptual questions!","This would be a good course to test yourself against as it is challenging.","Electromagnetism is everywhere, all around us.  Anything that you see around you is explained by this powerful physical framework.  That said, if you're interested at all with the nitty-gritty of the grace of the workings of our universe, take this course, it's worth it.  Just when you have another pset due for this class and it's ruining your night because the problems refuse to solve themselves, try to remember it, and the night will get better, I promise.","Don't take it for fun unless you're good at physics, because you'll have to work hard and not getting things will be frustrating. But at the same time you'll have fun in lecture and you'll make friends! So if you have to take it for some reason or another it's not a bad thing at all.","Be ready to do lots of multivariable calc. It's very key to this course. Pay attention in lecture and read purcell, then find some problems solved online for practice and you'll be all set.","It's great if you love physics and are looking for a challenge, but don't take it if you just want to fulfill a certain requirement","This course is not necessarily the best-organized and you will probably need to learn a lot on your own. But E&M is an important subject and you probably will not see both the practical applications and the mathematical development in any other class. The atmosphere is a supportive one and overall I would recommend this to anyone with the appropriate background and level of interest.","Make friends in the class, because its pretty much impossible to do the problem sets alone.","This class is difficult. Extremely difficult. Furthermore, Professor Denef doesn't seem too engaged in the course or the students either; he knows his material, but he is very unorganized and his lectures are a bit over the place. Pair this with no lecture slides or notes and the class becomes almost impossible to review for. Problem Sets are really difficult and math intensive, but doing them during Physics night in Leverett with a good group of friends in the class will be the best time you have all semester. Oh, and if you're premed like I am, please reconsider taking this course to fulfill your requirement. Save yourself the stress and take 11b or PS2.","It's not a bad course but it's not great.

I think the main problem was the sections component of this course. They were not really helpful, and a lot of people simply didn't show up. And the textbook was not helpful and never used.","It is MUCH more difficult than 15a. Prepare to work much harder, and read your textbook.","Physics 15b is a challenging course, but it will greatly deepen your understanding of electromagnetic theory.  It's worth the effort.","This class is so hard!  If you don't really like physics and calculus, take 11b instead and spare yourself the pain.","This course is a good all around introduction to Electricity and Magnetism. I recommend this course over Physics 11b for people who are actually interested in physics and are considering pursuing a science or engineering as their concentration.","better than 11b and not as horrible as 153, according to rumor","It's physics and Professor Morii is a great teacher.","Don't take this course. Take 11b if you have to.","Not too difficult if you've taken AP physics, but you will still learn.","It's definitely not easy, and it doesn't leave you with a satisfying intuition like 15a did (for me at least), but it's probably the best E&M option you've got. It's pretty heavy on math (not necessarily too many new concepts if you've had 21a, but lots of arithmetic), so be prepared, especially on exams.","Physics 15b is a solid E&M physics class. It gives in depth knowledge of the concepts and, if required, seems to prepare well for more advanced courses.","Much more mathematically demanding than 15a.  Challenging but doable, especially if you have took AP Physics C in high school.  Morii is (usually unintentionally) hilarious!","The course feels very disconnected. The lectures, the section, the labs all seemed very independent of each other. Even the psets. Most people didn't even attend lecture.","If you're really great at E&M you might want to just skip to 153 - you definitely might be bored otherwise. If you took 16, prepare for some relief since the class is much easier in terms of hours per week.","get griffiths' intro to electrodynamics. it's an excellent book.","You'll have to work hard to do well. At the same time, Morii is great, and the weekly homework is not that difficult. The material is decently interesting, too. If you're frustrated by practicalities, take 153 instead.","It's really hard even if you did well in 15a.  Don't take it unless you like doing a lot of math and truly want to learn E&M.  Review your section problems constantly because they are probably the best resource for exam prep.  Ask questions in section, go to office hours, and do the practice midterms early so you know whether you know what's going on.  Morii is an engaging professor but even if you think you understand lecture it doesn't mean you can solve the problems.  I hear bad things about 11b but think seriously about taking this class -- it seems easy in the beginning but it can be an ordeal.","Morii tries and every human should know E&M, so take the class.","This class can be very challenging and a lot of work, but is also very rewarding. If you're not seriously interested and willing to commit a lot of time and effort, think twice before taking this class. But if you are interested in physics and want to learn some amazing stuff about electromagnetism, definitely take this class. You won't regret it.","Don't take 153.","If you like Physics (especially if you liked 15a and\/or liked AP Physics), this is a good course to take.  If you don't like Physics very much, don't take this course.  It was taught differently than 15a, but concepts from 15a did make a reappearance (e.g., special relativity, harmonic oscillators).","Physics is pretty.","It is a good course and you learn a lot of physics.  Ask questions and form study groups.","Professor Morii is a very good lecturer - he explains concepts well and is generally engaging. The class is challenging, and exams can at times be difficult.","Go to office hours.","This is a great course for teaching you EM with vector calculus. Sometimes the math would get a little fuzzy and it would be difficult to see the physics in it all.","Requires a lot of work, and won't be very rewarding even when you do put in that work. It will give you a pretty accurate first look at E&M, though.","This is a good class to take if you are considering concentrating in physics.","The class is difficult, but Professor Morii is great. Be prepared to spend 8+ hrs on PSets and do math you had forgotten from 21b, but lectures are very helpful in giving you a true understanding of the material.","Even though this class is challenging, it seems to be much more rewarding than taking the \"easier\", 11b.","Prof. Morii is great teacher and makes the class interesting. The material can certainly be challenging, and psets will be hard work and time-consuming. But, if you like physics, its well worth it!","The course will give you a strong theoretical and mathematical foundation for the study of electromagnetism.","Start reviewing early before you get overwhelmed by the number of equations and concepts.","This class is quite difficult, but the subject material is very interesting. The lectures are engaging and usually quite enjoyable. Make sure to go to office hours and seek out additional materials such as Purcell or Griffiths' Electromagnetism books if you need extra help.","If you take this class with Professor Morii, you can look forward to reasonable tests and great lectures\/lecture notes.","I would tell them to really think about the formulas we are given and what they imply, since most of them are very general and not as simple to just plug numbers into as mechanics seems to be.","It's really tough. Much more abstract than 15a. I did well in 15a but still struggled a lot on this class.","It's not an easy class.  Really take the time to consider your preparation before hopping in there with some other tough classes on the side.","The course is really well-taught.  The lectures are both informative and interesting, and I've learned a lot over the course of this semester; physics is an interesting subject, and this course definitely does it justice if you're willing to put in the work.","If you're not planning on being a physics concentrator and haven't seen electromagnetism before, it might be worth taking an easier E & M course.","this is a good solid course if you want to learn intro E and M. It is well taught and managable.","Brush up on your math.  Generally fun material, though.","This class is SO hard.  I put 20 hours a week on psets plus an hour for prelab and 3 hours for lab.  If you don't have this kind of time or you don't have an extensive physics background, don't take this class.  Some of my friends found the class manageable, but I was very unhappy with the grades I got for the amount of time I spent.  This class will be VERY competitive, so be prepared.","Morii is a ninja.","Hurray Physics!","Make sure you have a strong foundation in vector calculus","Definitely make time to review problem sets with friends.  It is really nice to find out that you made a small mistake early in the problem before having the assignment returned to you with the red marks...","This course is tough if you're not extremely good at physics, but well worth your time if you're very interested.  I wouldn't recommend it if you're taking it just for GenEd or premed, but if you are interested in physics, it's definitely worth a look.","I would suggest them to spend a lot of time solving additional problems, if they don't understand something."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["If you have to take the 15 series, just suck it up and do it. However do not take the class for fun. It is unnecessarily convoluted and confusing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I've heard bad things about the 11 series as well. There isn't really any good option. Beware that you will be with some VERY intelligent students. If you have to take this course, I recommend doing it in the off semester for the smaller class environment and more individual attention.","This class is awesome. It is more rigorous that 15a and is geared toward physicists. Don't take this course if you don't like math.","Study, do many problems, and show up to office hours as frequently as you can.","Take this class if you're prepared to work very hard and even then maybe not get an A.  Grasping the fundamental concepts will only get you so far-- you will also have to learn how to apply them to situations you've never seen before on exams and solve them in a very limited amount of time.  If you put in the work, though, you will be rewarded by gaining a grasp of the laws that tie together electricity and magnetism and underlie our entire world.","E&M is fantastic, but make sure you don't get too bogged down in the math and try to use some intuition often even if it seems hard to. We had the pleasure of taking the class with Professor Morii off-cycle (fall has fewer students in 15b), so we got a lot of individual attention. People in the class were quite high ability students, but you should be able to do fine on the midterms and final as long as you are relaxed and can reason out the problems. Problem sets can sometimes be confusing and time-consuming, so make sure you work with other people on them. I really recommend this course - if you hesitant about taking it, cast aside your fears and jump in! Morii has a cheerful humor and enthusiasm that will pick up your day.","Study continuously (review everyday if you can). This course is not like Physics 15a. The exams are tough. Take it in the spring if you can because there will be more people.","Be prepared for lots of math and vector calculus.  Try to brush up on Math 21a or above.","E&M is a very interesting subject, and the material is well-presented in the course. It's not extraordinarily difficult especially if you have your math down.","This is a good class as an introduction to E & M, and the challenge comes in the exams, which can sometimes be tricky or ask unexpected questions.","This course is really well taught.  It's not easy, and some of the material can seem irrelevant, but the teaching staff does a great job helping you understand it.  Labs were good too, and helped you see how the concepts applied.","Take E&M only if you need it--it's a very difficult topic, but I think that this is actually the best version of the intro class. The nice thing about taking it in the off semester is that 15 is the only intro physics level offered out of sequence, but sometimes, those in sequence tend to minimize your contribution to\/existence in the physics department.","Great course. Challenging. Allow yourself the time to work daily in the class.","Great introduction to electromagnetism, which is well-taught by Prof. Morii. Not the hardest course you'll ever take, but you need to put in some time to understand the material."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Fundamentally, the material is probably easier than what is covered in 16, but it is much more confusing. The labs can be fun, but I found that I was typically more frustrated with this course than excited about it, which is too bad, because I really liked the teaching staff.","If you're debating between 11b and 15b, definitely think about 15b; it's not particularly time-consuming, but you'll get a very solid background in physics and learn quite a lot of interesting topics. It's somewhat mathy, with multivariable calculus playing a pretty important role, but not very hard; I learned multivariable calculus better in this class than in Math 21a.","This is such a cool class. E&M is a pretty hard topic, but really interesting. Although the grading is a bit tough (very few As are given as opposed to classes like Physics 16), it's a really great class to take and you will learn a lot.","It's a well taught course, but it's very hard.","i generally dislike E&M, but there were sporadic moments of fascinating material. the scope of the course is broad. there were many times when i sat in lecture in complete confusion and lack of understanding, but you eventually get the hang of it, and the physics and maths is really beautiful.","interesting class that requires attention to appreciate","Very well taught with very good teaching staff and supporting material (lecture slides and textbook). If you are choosing between this and 11b, definitely take this - it's worth it!","If you have to take it you have to take it.  Work with friends on the problem sets and you'll be okay.  The midterms were very hard.  Study lots.  Don't overload on tough courses to take with it.","15b is much more theoretical than it needs to be. Entire lectures are swallowed by hard-to-follow math, and the physics behind the math is lost.","This is a great course if you love solving problems in electricity and magnetism. It may be too easy if you already have a solid background in electricity and magnetism from AP Physics C. The labs are fun and offer some great demonstrations.","Get ready to put it in.","it's hard but a lot of fun","This class was really hard for me, but for many it probably won't be. If you have a good intuitive grasp of physics and attend lecture regularly (neither of which applies to me) you will probably be fine. The TFs are very helpful, so make sure to ask them for help even if you are afraid to.  The labs are mostly awful-easily the worst part of this class.","The material is difficult, and so are questions related to it. But Professor Morii is great, and so is Girma. You'll learn to like it, don't worry.","it is a lot of work. find a study group","Having taken AP Physics C in high school, this course did not have enough new material to be consistently interesting or worthwhile.  If you used calculus in your E&M class, I would recommend looking for another course and trying to find some of past years exams or problem sets.  Professor Morii is fine, I never got the textbook, and less than half the class went to lecture, but it was posted online.","A good course if you are interested in physics, otherwise it will be very difficult to get through.","It is an interesting class, and it teaches the material well, but ultimately feels more about mathematics than physics.","An essential albeit not incredibly interesting part of any physics concentration.","Do three extra practice problems every day and you'll get an A.","This class is very challenging.  Prof. Morii is a good lecturer, but his assignments don't always relate well to exams.","It is tough but it's an amazing class. Grades aside, you'll come out feeling like you've learned a lot.","The course material is interesting, and Morii is a pretty good lecturer.  The class seems to focus a fair amount on the math and only discusses the concepts more implicitly, so some background knowledge about the concepts is a very helpful complement to all the math and complex set-ups in the course.","Ouch. I mean, I like physics and I even started hating this class halfway through. The lectures are good though.","A good continuation of 15a, 16. Much, much less brutal than 16, and covers the material really well. This is foundational stuff.","If you're passionate about physics and problem solving, 15b is certainly worth taking. You learn a tremendous amount of E&M, and develop great problem-solving skills. One huge advantage over 11b is that this course teaches the mathematical basis for electrical and magnetic phenomena. Though the math is difficult, its really cool to see WHY we observe these things. When E&M is taught without this level of calculus, it might as well be magic.\r\n\r\nHowever, 15b is an EXTREMELY difficult course. I cannot stress this enough. To completely understand the lectures requires a computer for a brain. More than other challenging courses (like chem 20), this class demands raw intelligence as much as hard work. It can be frustrating to struggle even though you're working so hard, but in the end everyone learns a tremendous amount. If you're willing to really grapple with tough math and physics, this class gives a very good background in E&M.","Great physics class.","Take it seriously, and it can be fun. Help people when you can. You'll need it.","Meh its ok","If you study and work hard, it's fine...really interesting material.","This class is challenging, but rewarding. If you are coming from 15a, be aware that many students are coming from 16, and the level of 15b is probably somewhere in the middle. Also, make sure you are comfortable with multivariable calculus, as it is used extensively in the course. If you did not take math 21a (or have not taken it for awhile), it may be useful to get a textbook and review the concepts. This is especially true if you took a higher level math class and understand the theoretical background, but may not know the direct applications. The course relies heavily on vector calculus, partial derivatives, and 3D integrals, so be sure you understand these concepts fully.","This is a pretty solid class. Professor Morii is a lot of fun, and a good lecturer. The textbook isn't really necessary, but if it's still available cheap as a course pack, I would say take advantage of that.","If Girma is a TF for this course, take it and have him be your TF because, in short, he radiates awesomeness (as well as physics knowledge).","Physics 15b is an interesting course.  It is extremely difficult (at least Morii makes impossible tests) but in any case, it's okay.  There are however some big logistical issues with the course.  First of all, old exams aren't consistent in terms of units with the exams you'll be taking - so when you are trying to study for midterms and final with old tests, they become fairly useless when you try to check your work.  Also the coordinate systems we use are not very well-defined and can often lead to general confusion.  The problem sets can be written in a misleading manner as well. As for lectures, they are interesting but won't help you with the problem sets or midterms, and I often found myself depending on section to survive.  Overall, don't take this course if you don't have to, but if you have to it's not awful.","A ton of fun and useful in every day life!","This course is pretty hard and often non-intuitive. Work through the concepts as best as you can, attend section religiously, don't be afraid to ask for help, and above all: practice practice practice. And then practice.","The homework sets were difficult but helpful.  The exams were terrifying but fair.  Absolutely worth the considerable time and effort it will take.","Be proactive about looking for problems to try outside of the problem sets because the homework alone is not sufficient preparation for the exams.","I was going to be a physics concentrator, and just how poorly this class is run has turned me off the department as a whole. Take at your own risk, and make sure you are more than familiar with your Math 21a material. I came to Harvard 99% sure I was going to concentrate in Physics, took 16, then 15b completely changed my mind.  If Harvard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physics department were best represented by 16, then I would most definitely continue with my previous concentration plan. However, it turns out 15b is a more accurate impression of what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like to concentrate in physics, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not exactly a positive one.","This is a great course if you're thinking about going on in physics. It is a good mix of theory and application in the lab. If you aren't a potential physics concentrator, it probably isn't worth taking this course because it is such a major time commitment.","I got an easy A in Physics 16, but had a lot more difficulty with Physics 15b. Don't take the class lightly."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This class is absolutely mind-blowing and the resources are incredible, but be prepared to no understand it regardless of the amazing teaching if you don't have a good instinct for it.","Electricity and magnetism has some pretty cool stuff, and Dr. Morin is an awesome teacher. The course is really well organized, and there's tons of help and support available, both for just getting a better grip on the material and for problem sets. Challenging, but never too much so. If you've taken, say, AP Physics before, there'll be some familiar-looking stuff, but done more thoroughly, plus plenty of new stuff. The only thing that's kind of meh is the labs... but besides that, I really liked the class. :)","David Morin is a great lecturer, teacher and person in general. Take this class with him and you will not regret it.","It's hard. But worthwhile.","It is an awesome class. Morin is the best physics professor.","Under previous instructors this class hasn't gotten the best reputation, but with Professor Morin this class is one of the best I've taken at Harvard thus far.","Don't be surprised to find it much more challenging than 15a, but the teaching staff is great and overall, it's a solid course. Material towards the end gets a bit rushed...","Good class, informative, gets the job done.","Physics 15b is a challenging experience that comes highly recommended if you are at all interested about the theory behind electricity or magnetism.  Dr. Morin is an excellent lecturer whose effort helps it all come together.","This course provides a standard teaching of electricity and magnetism. Having said that, this is a very difficult course and should not be taken lightly.","Take this class! You will spend a decent amount of time reviewing lecture concepts and doing problem sets \/ practice problems before exams, but it is a very fair class and your grade will reflect the work you put in (that is, don't be afraid because it is hard--help is available in many different forms and if you want to do well and are willing to put in the time, you will). The class teaches the concepts of E and M very well and will set you up well for future physics classes--I am ending the course feeling like I definitely learned a lot. Lectures are entertaining and interactive, and the class is exceedingly well organized. The lab component is great too. Overall just great class.","It's hard and mathy, but the material's neat","Morin is a great lecturer. The material is tough, but the teaching staff is awesome and will help you through any problems you have with the material. An interest in physics definitely helps as well. Overall a great course.","I had a tough time following the professor and his lectures, although the sections are very helpful. Only take this class if you are really into electricity and magnetism or have it as a requirement. This is definitely not a class to take \"for fun\" or \"in curiosity\".","Great course to take...I think this year the class was better than in previous years!","this is a good course, and electromagnetism is very useful (especially if you're planning to go into physics research or at least complete a degree at Harvard in physics or astrophysics). but man this stuff is hard. it's especially hard if you don't have a natural intuition for these things (which I didn't). be prepared to be owned sometimes. actually work with people for homeworks. AND GO TO OFFICE HOURS - Dr Morin is the BEST professor in the entire universe and entirely accessible.","Read the textbook, but do more problems than reading. going to class is a good idea too","If you really enjoy physics, Professor Morin is a fantastic lecturer and incredibly smart. Personally, physics was a bit tough for me, but I realized during the final exam that I had in fact learned a lot. While the problem sets are manageable, the exams are difficult. It also will be a lot easier to grasp if you have intuitive math sense. While they constantly emphasize that you don't need to get the math right, sometimes the problem is just impossible without it. Regardless, the course is good and often necessary for further physics. Overall, good course.","This class is hard. No doubt about that. Very hard. Electromagnetics for some reason just doesn't pop into your head magically (for us mortals anyway). But get to bond with fellow classmates in struggling for survival, also Morin is definitely the professor to take this class with, extremely helpful and shows a real care and assistance for anyone in his class.","Dr. Morin is the best.","its hard, so only take it if you want to","The exams are impossible.  Be prepared to feel very frustrated after each midterm.  The problem sets, on the other hand, are pretty enjoyable.","If you are looking to fulfill your physics requirement but aren't confident in your math\/physics skills, I do not recommend taking this class. If you love physics and have the time, then this is probably the course for you.","A solid introduction in E&M. Not the most exciting class you will ever take, but teaches you real physics.","The course is very difficult, but it is a requirement for Physics. Keep up with the lectures because even if you read the book, you won't get the full gist of it. Start the problem sets early and definitely prepare a lot for the exam!","Well designed course with a great textbook. There's no other class that teaches the material and introduces Maxwell's equations at least semi-rigorously (well, besides 153). Will challenge you at times, but the effort definitely worth getting a real understanding of the subject, as opposed to getting a very simplified view in a lower-level course.","A great, hard class.  You will learn electromagnetism.","It's harder than 15a (it makes less intuitive sense, at least to me) and it has a lot more math, so brush up on your calculus (especially vector calc).  Its manageable if you work in groups, study hard, and review the hw's before exams.","Immensely rewarding, if you like physics and mathematics!","15b is definitely harder than 15a but not by that much. They both take a lot of work, 15b is just a bit more difficult conceptually. I didn't take E&M in high school so there was a learning curve in the beginning that was hard to get over, but by the end I had a good grasp on the material.","Definitely not easy, but definitely worthwhile. You'll find a lot of people happy to help you among Dr. Morin, the TFs, and the lab instructors. Make sure you brush up on vector calc before the semester or in the beginning of the semester; if you don't remember that stuff, E&M will probably be very confusing. Also, I didn't take AP Physics or any E&M before this class and it was not a big deal. Overall, a great class. I learned a ton.","This class is very difficult but luckily is difficult to almost everyone. Requires a lot of study time and work on the Psets. Definitely set aside a lot of time to study for the midterms and final!","Morin is a great teacher, but regardless, the material in E&M is extremely interesting - it ties in to relativity, electronics, and many interesting thought experiments! And learning about magnetism actually is - it'll blow your mind."]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["Physics 15b is an excellent but difficult course.  Morin is a good lecturer and the textbook is absolutely fantastic.  Make sure you keep up with the readings, and check the appendices--there's useful stuff in there!  The problem sets can be tough but are generally very doable.  But the material is a bit abstract and the course goes pretty quickly, especially at the beginning (so it may be advisable to brush up the definitions of field, potential, Coulomb force etc).  Also, knowing vector calc coming in is EXTREMELY helpful--having a good grasp of 3D integration (in cartesian, cylindrical, spherical coordinates) is absolutely essential, as is a good understanding of Stokes' Theorem and div, grad and curl.  Last, taking 21b concurrently helps a lot since complex exponentials occurr at the same time in both courses.\r\n\r\nThe one problem with the course is that the midterms are incredibly difficult.  The real problem is that they're too long, or you don't have enough time, so working very quickly is heavily favored.  Don't freak out about doing badly--everyone has trouble with the midterms.  Fortunately, the final is much easier because you have far fewer problems per hour.","It's a good course. Very solid but it wasn't very challenging. However, I still learned how to use more complex mathematics in physics.","I loved this course. I never took E&M before this class but Morin makes it easy to pick up. The psets are MUCH easier that 16 but the downside is that the tests are hard (mostly because of the number of questions you have to answer in the short amount of time). But overall, this course has been my favorite so far and taken me a step closer to choosing physics as a concentration.","This course is pretty challenging. So unless you already know everything about E&M (in that case take 153), you can't take this course as your fourth or fifth hard class. Be prepared to work hard and do all the extra problems from the previous semesters.","It teaches you E&M, and does a pretty good job of it. It's hard but doable, and you gotta have it, so take it.","As far as introductory physics courses go, this course is great. David Morin is very knowledgeable, and presents information in a very clear and organized way in lecture, so you can easily learn the relevant information. The problem sets can be somewhat challenging, but are manageable, and there is tons of help available from both Morin and section leaders if you have questions. The exams can also be pretty challenging, but this really helps to ensure that you know the material and have a lasting understanding of it once you're through with the course.","Very difficult, but rewarding.  Great teaching staff.  David Morin is AMAZING.  Problems from the homework appear in the exams, so if you work hard you will be rewarded.","There are some very interesting topics in this class, but sometimes they can be hidden under a lot of math. Make sure to pull back and look at the bigger picture from time to time!","15b is great for individuals who can visualize various setups. Do not take it if you have not taken multivariable calculus PREVIOUSLY (not concurrently).","Great course, just be ready to work hard to understand the material because things don't usually make sense the first time they are taught.","This course is a very thorough introduction to electricity and magnetism.  While sometimes E&M gets the reputation of being just a bunch of painful multivariable integrals, this course actually makes you think and the problems can be quite interesting!  David Morin really adds a lot to the course.  His teaching is just excellent, and the psets and exams cement your understanding of the material.  Neither the psets nor the exams are that difficult if you put in the time to learn the material.  I felt so satisfied with what I had learned after this course!","Professor Morin is an amazing professor who is able to impart his understanding of the material in lecture and at physics nights. Developing a group of friends to work on the psets and study with is very helpful. The tests can be challenging, but I feel like I have learned a lot.","Do not take this class as an elective unless you really like physics. I would recommend 11b if you are not concentrating in physics.","The homework load isn't too bad (~3-5 hrs a week) and PSI can be quite fun (I felt that it was more structured than Physics 15a PSI). Lectures can be quite dull, especially since there are very few demos, but can't really change that. Professor Morin is a really nice person, and you should definitely take the time to go to one of his many office hours!","Difficult but rewarding if you work hard enough.","The course is demanding and challenging, but is super well organized and taught well. David Morin is awesome. Also, I found this a lot less confusing than Physics 15a in terms of complicated structures i.e. the problems are more abstract but much more mathematically challenging.","Wish I hadn't been such a slacker, doable if you put the hours in","Take it if you seriously want to learn the material. If you're interested, it's not that tough.","This class isn't that bad. Don't be intimidated by it if you didn't take 16. If you work hard, you can do well.","It's a well run class, but the material gets challenging and a lot of smart people take the class.  As such, don't get too amped up about grades or frustrated when the tests are a lot harder than you anticipated.  Focus on the things that you are learning.","Definitely take this class, it is a must for physics concentrators. Morin is great, but especially difficult.","A lot of work, but well worth it. Will change how you understand the world and make you love science.","Great course to get a solid handle on E&M. David Morin is a very enthusiastic  and great lecturer who is very approachable.","Great course. You should definitely take it over PS3 or 11b if you have scientific self-respect, i.e. you actually want to rigorously learn some stuff. The material is very interesting and really makes you think hard. David Morin is a very good, albeit dry, lecturer, and he puts a great deal of effort into making this class run smoothly. The class provides an overwhelming amount of resources. Exams are difficult, and you will struggle with the material, but it will be worth it in the end. The only drawback to the class is that there are too many required hours\/week. 3 hours of lecture + 3 hours of lab + 1.5 hours of section = too much class time for one course. I recommend making section optional and cutting down lab to 2 hours at most.","If you are deciding between this and physics 11, I would suggest taking this.  Yes its harder and yes you might get a lower grade, but you're going to have to work hard either way and you might as well have a feeling of accomplishment for hanging in there with the physics geniuses.","Be ready to be confused! But if you work through the material, it will eventually make sense.","It's hard but definitely worth the time and effort.","A challenging but well-run course. Definitely recommended if you are a science concentrator with a strong background in math\/physics and are ready to put in some time. Be sure to go to office hours frequently; the course staff are very helpful.","it's very very hard, but professor Morin makes it worth taking.","The class as taught by Morin was excellent. His lectures are informative and it's fascinating to see him work. It's sometimes frustrating to see how easily it all comes to him, but hopefully by the end of the semester, it will all be at your fingertips also. This class is full of physics concentrators, it's part of the 15abc143a track and you have the chance to build a real community with the people around you. Don't underestimate the material in this course (particularly if you are coming from 15a), it will require effort and patience. You will be learning SKILLS and not just information - so you won't be able to cram for this class on the final day. Make sure you keep up with the readings, and glancing at the readings before lecture has a massive pay off.","Great physics class with a great professor. Definitely take this!","A strong math background is essential to doing well in this class. Though it helps to have seen the physics before, more often than not the trick to a problem involves a clever choice of variables or some other mathematical skill.","At least when taught by David Morin, this class has been great. Just about the right difficulty - not too easy, but nowhere near impossible. Don't be discouraged by the slow pace and simplicity of early lectures, as that phase passes quickly.","I am an engineering student who wanted to take the 15 series for physics as a challenge.  I certainly got it.  In retrospect, though 15a was great, I almost feel that unless you have a knack for physics or you plan on needing a little more advanced physics, I would recommend 11b over this course, especially to fellow engineers.  You almost need to go to physics night if you want to do comparably well to everybody else on problem sets.  Scheduling gave me no such luck.\r\n\r\nI will say though that the lab portion of this course is great and a lot of fun.  If you enjoy seeing the derivations of laws and equations, this is also a good course.","This class is taught with great clarity, and is essential for anyone thinking of concentrating in physics or (I would argue) math or applied math. \r\nThe physics department has some of the best TFs I have seen, and this course was no exception.","This class makes you think. A lot. And even when you do so, you'll probably be wrong. A great part of this class is the community its students create in struggling over problems together. Get a study group together, and get it early. Definitely go to physics night, but it's most helpful if you've done (or at least attempted) most of the problems. It's incredibly hard, but very rewarding if you do it right. It's a great experience to be with a group of classmates, a hard problem drawn out on a blackboard, with everyone standing around trying to puzzle it out together.","I took this class because I hadn't the faintest idea what electricity was beyond Coloumb's law, and it was very good at giving me a solid background in the subject. The labs were really enjoyable, and lectures were good. A very solid course worth taking if you are interested in the subject.","This course is hard. That being said, you're probably not even looking at this unless you're interested in \/required to be interested in physics. Unless you already have a killer schedule otherwise, take this over 11b because Morin is simply awesome and the material is really interesting. But be prepared to sink a lot of time into this course. The psets can be really tricky, and if you skimp on lectures or readings you can get a chapter or two behind really quickly.","If you've taken a class with Morin before, you should take this class. If you haven't, you should also take this class. All of the teaching staff are very helpful. And go to physics night!","This course is TOUGH but GREAT. Problem solving abilities are definitely expanded with this course and a thorough conceptual understanding of a lot of the theory is well-instilled. A note about lectures, though: they can be quite dry and even unclear. You will most likely learn the material primarily through the problem sets and the section component of the course - both of which are excellent. Section is very helpful (DON'T skip it!) and the problem sets get you to think in many different ways. A part of the course guidelines that isn't stressed enough: make sure you're able to explain your work well to both a well-learned classmate AND a layperson. If you find yourself having trouble, go to section and office hours. Also, join the family and go to physics night!","A very fun and interesting class. It takes a non historical approach to electromagnetism, and shows the direct relationship between relativity and magnetism. Great class.","Morin's awesome.","This is the best class ever! (When Prof Morin is teaching it). He is really awesome - lectures are fun, homework problems are cool, and even the exams are seriously exciting. Lab in 15b is way more fun than 15a too!","Go to office hours.  Get the Pset done as early as you can","Physics 15b is not your typical E&M course. For necessary background, I'd recommend a hefty bit of AP Physics C with E&M, since you won't be learning your Gauss' Law and all that in this course. Also, facility with relativity (a thorough background from 15a is sufficient) and multivariable calculus would be highly recommended. Given that, though, try to get yourself a great section leader, and it should be a fun ride. Oh, and \"Imma let you finish, but Andrew Robert Milewski is one of the best TFs of ALL TIME!\"","Definitely make sure you're capable with physics and have a strong desire to be challenged by physics if you're thinking about taking this course.","Get ready.","This course demonstrates the use of mathematics in physics, while respecting the distinction between the two.  It also covers a variety of interesting topics including relativity and waves, and this is definitely not a repeat of AP Physics C.","great class. deriving magnetism from relativity and electricity was really cool."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["This class is great! I thought I hated e+m but it's actually really interesting. Morin is great, and his lecture notes are very helpful - really makes you able to just pay attention in lecture and really learn.

I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed it!","If you are interested in physics, it is a really good class. It is well taught and you will learn a lot by the end of it. It is difficult though.","It's hard but a lot of fun! I actually didn't do too well in the class, however, it was very enjoyable material. You need to spend a lot more time than you would think in order to actually understand the concepts. Make a study group early.","Beware of PSI.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of supports (lecture, section, office hours, lecture notes, coursepack, online lecture videos, previous exams, Wednesday Physics night), so you can learn the material in your own way.","This class is challenging but fair. It is assumed that you've taken E&M in high school, so if you haven't, be prepared to work hard to keep up.","Don't let the Q-guide fool you, this is a very difficult class. However, what's worse is that the most intelligent students in the school take it. I thought the material was interesting and I learned a lot, but it was very difficult for me to compete with some of my classmates.","This class is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. I really learned a lot and the support is fantastic.","You're only going to take this if you need it, so there's not much to add.","This is a well-taught course, but a quite difficult course that goes into more detail than non-physics majors really need. For other types of scientists, if a well-taught alternative is available I would take it.","Dr. Morin is amazing. Electricity & Magnetism is very cool. Much better than 15a.","It's a lot of work, but you learn a lot. Start the psets early and read over the lecture notes the night before, and you'll be fine.","good class. not too, too hard. usually, fun to reason through. you'd probably want to start psets before wednesday nights, but a lot of people don't. definitely doable after 15a with morin.","its very interesting.  Its difficult but the professors are understanding and it is presented in a way that you can really immerse yourself in the matierial","This was literally the hardest class I have ever taken, and I'm a physics concentrator. If you haven't taken a course strictly on E&M before it might be a rough semester. The lab component was GREAT though - we learned a lot and there was no stress and barely any work outside of class.","Take E&M when Morin is teaching it! (or just take whatever course Morin is teaching) he is so amazing! anyone can tell he puts so much time and energy into the course; he tries very hard to improve every single bit of it. you can hardly find another instructor whose office hour is as abundant as Morin's. he is super accessible and helpful. the textbook is amazing, online lecture notes are extremely well written, and exams are fair (means are actually low but if you know physics, you shouldn't be scared).","Don't take this unless you have to for physics concentration.","It's a good class, but definitely a challenge. Go to physics night, it's really helpful. There's always someone who understands those confusing problems (sometimes it's even you!)","This is a thorough, rigorous approach to E&M. It requires a fair amount of work and time, but problem sets are ok if you get help (at office hours and from classmates). It's really interesting physics! The lab is very low-key."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["The concepts themselves are not too difficult to grasp, but Morin always finds a way to come up with tricky problems. Study well for the test and do practice problems and it won't be so bad.","A great class on E&M. After AP Physics C, a fair amount of the material is review, but with the addition of multivariable calculus, and there's still plenty of new stuff. Best science textbook I've ever used, by far. Problem sets are manageable, and they really do help you learn the material. Plus, the exam questions are just like the pset questions, so its good prep.","Only take if you both love math and are good at it. Expect not to be able to solve any pset on your own.","This class is challenging, but it really forces you to think about the material and flex your problem solving skills. You will leave with a very good intuitive understanding about how certain electromagnetic phenomenon happen","The tests are killer.","David Morin's lectures are very lucid and he has great demonstrations throughout the year. The psets are very easy, especially if you're coming from 16. However, the exams are a bit of a shock; they are not too difficult, but they are very long, to the point of not being able to do the moderately difficult problems thoroughly. Despite this the course was pretty easy overall and you won't have too hard a time if you ask plenty of questions and go to office hours when you struggle.","This course is not well laid out at all. The lecture is incomprehensible and useless, then the problem sets are relatively easy to figure out from the book (which in itself is not very clear), and then the tests are on a whole different level from the assignments. The first midterm was way too difficult considering the level of work that people were used to from the problem sets. Then the second midterm was on more of the right level along with the final. But the process of feeling like the class was too easy and then getting destroyed by the midterm just demoralized students and made the class a bitter chore.","This is a very hard class, so make sure you have at least 10 hours a week to dedicate to it. There is a lot of material, and the exams are very challenging. If you think you are good at physics, this class will show you that you're not. But if you really like physics, stick it out and give yourself another chance. A lot of people do very poorly in this class, but they still end up concentrating in physics.","Make sure to keep up with the assignments and the readings, and do practice problems before the exams. Make sure to look at the solutions posted by Dr. Morin himself.","This is a good, mildly rigorous intro to E\/M.  If you have already had E\/M and have some mathematical sophistication, consider 153.  The tests are awful, so be careful.","Physics 15b is going to be a hard course if you don't have much experience with physics. Personally, I took AP Physics EM in high school and I found that the material was often repetitive of that. However, I certainly still enjoyed the class a lot, and the problem sets were legitimately fun. However, one thing to certainly do is prepare very well for the exams. The time constraints are rough and it's very important that you be prepared for that. I recommend going through all of the previous tests before EVERY exam. I mistakenly didn't do them under time pressure before the final and suffered for it.","Good class, if you took 15a\/16 you will likely be taking this course, but Morin does a good job and other than PSI it's a great course.","This is one of the hardest classes I've taken at Harvard.  It takes up a lot of time for meetings alone (3 hrs of lecture + 1.5 hr section + 3 hr lab) and then the problem sets take several hours on top of that.  Midterms and finals are often exceedingly difficult, and the competition is strong relative to most other classes at Harvard.  If you go in expecting to work really hard, get slightly lower grades than usual, and learn some cool physics, you will be glad you took this class.","This is a great introduction to E&M. Dr. Morin is especially good at teaching and is easy to access out of class. His is also very funny.\r\n\r\nThe book required for this class, Purcell (edited by Morin), is phenomenal. Even if you don't take this class, you should rent or buy the book; it's great. \r\n\r\nThis class will be easy for you if:\r\n-You took Physics 16\r\n-You were at the top of your 15a class\r\n-You have had prior experience with E&M and Multivariable Calculus\r\n\r\nThis class will be a challenge for you if:\r\n-You struggled in 15a\r\n-You don't like math","15b is definitely more interesting than high school physics and is taught using more mathematical sophistication and Purcell and Morin's book is fantastic, but overall the homework was fairly easy, so if you want more of a challenge, consider taking 153 as well.","If you want to do physics, then this class is a requirement anyways, but as E&M courses it's not terrible. I think you do come out with a better understanding of electromagnetism, and it's certainly not that much work to get by. That being said, E&M is an inherently difficult study to gain an intuition for, and they don't do a terribly good job teaching that to you. The textbook is pretty good (though not as charming as Morin's mechanics book), the community kind of gets divided into the 16\/15a cliques. Still, this isn't a class you dread (unless it's midterm time), and I've had good times with people learning some pretty cool stuff. The derivation of light especially was absolutely beautiful, and working up to Maxwell's equations was really quite amazing. If physics is something you do because you are genuinely interested in the world, there are some wonderful moments in this class you'll really enjoy.","I had a love-hate relationship with this class. The curve is nice but the exams are absurd. David Morin is too quiet and awkward in lectures, but he's actually pretty good and the lecture notes are really helpful. It's also very nice that we use a textbook that was written by Morin - everything kind of feels very focused. The problem sets aren't hard, especially if taken on through a group effort. The hardest part of this class is staying awake during lecture. They are dull. Take this class if you like physics and intend on concentrating in it or a related field; otherwise, find something more exciting.","This class is very hard.  Lots of time needs to be devoted to it in order to understand the course material.","Do not take it unless it is absolutely necessary. Do not even take it if you are interested in physics and like it and want to take a physics class. You will hate physics after this course.","The examples in the textbook are incredibly helpful.","This is a really well- run and well- taught course.  You have to put work into it to get anything out of it, and it is a lot of work but worth it.  Definitely a better option than 11b if you are willing to put in the time.","Seriously think before you take this class. It's hard, VERY HARD. If you're not that comfortable with math or physics, but like a challenge, this is not the class to challenge yourself. Or maybe it is. I don't know you, I'm just trying to be helpful. I say it one more time with feeling: seriously think before taking this class.","Take Applied Physics 50b or Physics 12b!! Actually, this was the worst class I have taken so far at Harvard by far. I took Physics C E&M in high school was still thoroughly confused the entire semester and I certainly didn't learn anything. The tests are impossible and the problem sets aren't much better. You will need to go to physics night every week to even have a chance of finishing the homework unless you're already brilliant at E&M. The first exam isn't until after the last day to drop classes, and I really wish someone would have told me to drop it beforehand. Don't take this class!","Super tough course. Problem sets are hard, and our final was especially difficult.","The course is pretty good, especially as it develops magnetism naturally using relativity. At times, there could be too much computation in the tests, however.","This will be one of the harder if not the hardest class (if not just due to the time consumption) you take during the semester.","This course is very very hard! Be careful when selecting classes, make sure you want to put in alot of hours every week to learn and be very challenged. Morin is a great teacher and is there to help you, but it is a very tough subject.","If you did not take Physics 16, Physics 15b should teach you how to actually do physics and go through a physics class. You'll finally get to apply all that calculus you've learned up to math 21a. This class is definitely a hard one but its worth it. It does not simply teach you E&M, it teaches you how to think, to solve problem, to take a physics class.","This is definitely a good introduction to electromagnetism, and all the resources are there to help you succeed in it.","I've heard this class varies greatly depending on who is teaching it. Dr. Morin is the key factor in making this class a success. Although 15b is challenging, the course builds up in a logical manner. Section was not very helpful, but office hours are definitely key.","Don't take this class lightly and with little prior physics instruction.","This course is challenging, but well worth the effort. At the end of the course, you will have a very good understanding of E and M, but it will take a fair amount of effort. It would probably be a good idea to have some background in E and M from high school, but it isn't exactly required.","David Morin is fantastic and his book is unparalleled. His lectures go at a good pace and it's relatively easy to follow along with the lecture notes.","The course material itself is inherently difficult, but if David Morin is teaching the class, then you will have one of the most gifted educators at Harvard helping you through it. The real strength of the class lies in the teaching staff as well as the huge amount of study material that they give you (old exams, extra problems, etc). Take advantage of all of it and enjoy it! It will be tough but you'll end up seeing the world in a different light.","This class is not as hard as it may sound! It is extremely well organized.","I would strongly recommend that anyone seriously interested in physics skip this course if at all possible. Instead of thinking about problems, this course emphasizes a \"plug into equations without thinking\" mentality. The exams are difficult and the scores are so low not because the material is challenging, but because of the time pressure and the arbitrary grading. Between mandatory section and lecture attendance and the lab, this course ended up taking a lot more time than it should have provided that not much was actually taught. After Physics 16, this course was a big step backwards since instead of in 16 where thinking about the problems and coming up with clever solutions was the key focus, here instead the problems didn't involve much if any thinking and if you did happen to come up with a short solution that was different from the solution posted by the course staff, you were docked points for failing to solve the problem the way they wanted it to be solved. Despite the physics itself being very interesting, this course managed to replace any interest I had in the subject with frustration.","PSI is very aggravating, but necessary, and the class itself is well-run and well-taught. Section leaders can be hit or miss.","I really enjoyed the PSI section for this course -- it was much more interesting than in the 15A\/16 section, and the phenomena were much more fun to play with. More importantly, it gave some experience in seeing the actual challenge in applying a given set of ideas to actual things that are happening.","Take it take it! If you felt like 15a was good and want more, this is a perfect follow up. E&M is interesting, wicked cool, and highly applicable to life. And professor Morin is probably one of the best physics teachers in the department","Physics 15b will be difficult. Do not expect to breeze through, no matter how you did in 15A or previous physics courses. It won't be impossible, though, and a good study group will help. Also, a good TF will make all the difference.","This class is insanely difficult. It is by no means an \"introductory\" course, and should not be taken as that. Only take this class if you absolutely love physics and need it to fulfill a concentration requirement.","Electromagnetism is hard. Take with caution, but do take the class because it's great.","The course was an absolute blast, and Professor Morin was a great teacher. The problem sets and exams can be very difficult, but physics night in lev was a big help. Also, hearing Morin say \"whisk\" every week (as in, \"Doug, would you please whisk these problem sets away\") was one of the single greatest joys of my freshman year.","This is a really good course - well organized, with a wealth of materials available for you! Tips: do the psets, and make sure you know how to do all the problems by yourself. Do practice exams, go to office hours, and if you're ever confused, reread the textbook.","A moderately difficult introduction to electricity and magnetism. Those very comfortable with E+M already should consider skipping the course, but otherwise it provides a solid basis from which to proceed into electrodynamics.","If you have a somewhat strong background of electromagnetism, you might want to consider skipping this and take a 100-level course instead.","not interesting or fun, take it if you have to, it's relatively painless but not a great class.","Morin is an amazing professor, and the text is well written and instructive. The class is challenging, so expect to be working hard. While the class will push you, you will be rewarded by learning a lot of interesting material.","Put it this way: if you survived 15a, you will probably survive 15b (and enjoy it slightly more too). I hear that the same cannot be said for 15c, so good luck if you're a potential Physics concentrator.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if there's no reason for you to take 15b I don't think it's a class people take for \"fun\".","Good class- Morin is a great lecturer.  Problem sets aren't easy but they're not too hard - they do a good job of preparing you for the midterm (for the midterm, study the psets!).  PSI component is interesting and fun (much better that Physics 16 or 15a PSI)","Physics 15b is an excellent course in which to learn electromagnetism.  Morin is a great lecturer and he's very relaxed and helpful at his office hours and at physics nights in Leverett.  The P-Sets are sometimes a bit lengthy but very fair and of appropriate difficulty.  Definitely a step down from Physics 16 but if you're coming from 16 it's still challenging enough to be very interesting.  If you're coming from 15a it may be a bit more difficult but it's certainly manageable.  Lab's are definitely more interesting than in 15a\/16 but they're still a bit of a pain.  Overall, though it's a great courses and it feels very balanced and very well-paced, even if you've never done E\/M before.","If you don't have to take this class I wouldn't recommend it. Coming from physics 15a, this class was significantly harder and assumes a fair amount of background knowledge. That being said, if you feel like you have enough background experience from high school and you want to challenge yourself, this class will definitely fulfill your desire. If it's not necessary, though, I'd recommend doing 11\/12 instead.","Work on psets with others and really understand the questions and solutions when they are posted. The exams are usually based off the pset questions.","Not particularly interesting, especially if you've taken 16. It teaches you what you need to know, but the problem sets are generally pretty boring; PSI is definitely better, but still not great. Morin's a pretty good lecturer though.","15b is a great course. it is challenging and fun without killing you. there are so many opportunities to get help on the homework and the material. professor morin is a great lecturer. he is always well prepared and the lectures correspond well to the book, which is also great.","David Morin is very organized and clear with his lectures and explanations. he also is dedicated to having lots of office hours that you can go to for help.  The problem sets, although not entirely easy, are manageable.  The exams can be very difficult but they get scaled.","Spend adequate time understanding material (reading) before attending lecture, otherwise the class and homework will be confusing and difficult.","I felt like I've learned a lot from this class! Psets take a lot of time, but office hours are a great time to work with other people and get help on any difficult problems. Prof Morin is a fantastic lecturer and really really cares about the students' learning. He is super helpful during office hours as well. The exams are pretty challenging, but there are lots of practice exams to help you prepare.","The material in this class is deep and fascinating, and if you have any interest at all in learning real physics, you should most certainly take this class over 11a or, god forbid, PS3. But this is certainly a challenging class if you don't have extensive physics background. I had never taken E&M before, and I was at a serious disadvantage; many of your peers in this class will have had significant experience with the course material and\/or will be seriously brilliant physics majors. Nonetheless, Dr. Morin is on the whole a truly caring and involved professor. His lectures are sometimes hard to understand, but if you put in the effort and see him at office hours, you can get a lot out of this class.","This is a pretty challenging class, but really rewarding! You'll need a solid calculus background and it's definitely helpful to have a good physics background from high school. Professor Morin's lectures are very clear as well as the book, and there are plenty of resources to help with the psets (office hours, peers at physics night).","If you've taken 16, you should probably take 153. I really should have done 153, but I was a bit too worried about a challenging language course I was taken. It probably would have served me better to have taken 153 and put off the language course; 15b was just too easy.","Physics 15b is ridiculously harder than physics 15a. Not to mention that all the physics 16 students are here to vaporize any help you could've received from a curve. 15a and 15b have combined into my most negative experience at Harvard, strictly because the courses are designed not only to weed out the students who aren't driven to do the work, but to also weed out the students who learn a bit slower than their peers (like me). Whether it's the TF, the PSI preceptors, or the former Physics 16 students, you can expect to have SOMEONE speak to you condescendingly. It makes seeking help much harder, even if you swallow your pride. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Only take this class if you're a genius relative to Harvard students, because if you've gotten good grades because of hard work and not brains, you'll probably get stomped on by the powers that be."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This is not an easy course! However, you learn a lot of cool materials! Math is extremely important!","Physics 15b is not a joke. It is really hard material and learning and practicing this kind of material takes time. I did not have much time, and I wish that I had more time to put in. With that said, electricity and magnetism is way more interesting than the material covered in Physics 15a! But if you're an engineer and have other hard classes, I'd seriously recommend taking an easier class, even if you think that you love physics and all that... Physics 15b is just hard. But still a great class! Girma is great!","Note: this evaluation applies primarily to the course as it was taught by Girma, as other professors may do it quite differently. Overall, a very good course. Taught electromagnetism clearly enough so that any scientist\/engineer could apply it, and also showed some of the beauty behind the mathematics (although I would have liked some more general derivations). Problem sets were reasonably challenging, yet rewarding and interesting, and exams were very fair (often, the exam questions were taken almost word for word from problem sets).  Electromagnetism is very difficult conceptually, but this course presented it in a way so that it didn't feel too hard.","The class offers a strong and expansive understanding of electromagnetism.","Girma is a great and enthusiastic professor, who at times might overestimate the intelligence of the class but does so only because he is so passionate about learning and teaching.","Girma is an energetic lecturer and very helpful during office hours. PSI was pretty interesting and Mara was a fun lab instructor. If you're looking at taking this, it's probably because you have to for your concentration. Would definitely recommend taking it with Hailu though!","Very interesting course material, but very few resources for becoming familiar with the material. The book is good, but not particularly practical, as it goes into a lot of depth that is not necessary for developing a good understanding of how to solve EM problems. The material is presented very quickly, and Girma was sure not to \"waste [our] time\" explaining things twice. I think he should have wasted the time.","This class was well taught by Professor Hailu and definitely requires a lot of work if you want to do well and fully understand the material!","A necessary course for many. Definitely a challenge, but worth it. Get Elliot if you can!","Take 15B! You will learn physics much more fundamentally, which is much more enjoyable than memorizing a bunch of formulas. The math is definitely doable! Please read Morin's book as the course moves along, as it does a great job in explaining some of the tougher concepts.","don't be too scared, it's not worse than 15a, and I found it much more interesting - just keep up with psets, attend lecture, etc. and if you can, take it when Girma's teaching, he's wonderful!","This class was very difficult to take, having exactly zero prior experience with electricity and magnetism AND having had a semester without math just before.  BUT, I learned a pretty incredible amount.  Despite the stress and frustration I struggled with all term, I really don't think I would have learned as much or had as valuable an experience in a lower-level physics course.","This course is a good way to learn E&M. I took it after Physics 16, and found it to be substantially easier.","I wish I took this class when Morin taught it...even though I've heard Morin is difficult, he likely helps you develop a better intuition for the material than Girma does.","Girma is super enthusiastic about the material but confusing at times. Our TF Elliot was amazing and clarifies a lot of physics, so section was very useful."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I really enjoyed this class and I think David Morin is the best lecturer I've had for any class so far. The psets are appropriately difficult, but are certainly manageable and are a great indicator of how the tests will be. Just make sure that you understand the psets, and don't rely too much on your peers for help. Section was pretty pointless and PSI was a pretty annoying chore every week. Otherwise great class to take, much better than anything else if you actually want to learn physics.","Very hard to follow what was going on in lecture. Certain sections were not very informative.","The material is pretty interesting, especially compared to mechanics, and it's a fun class! It's definitely less work than Physics 16, but it's a very solid understanding. David Morin knows what he is doing, and he is very clear and accessible outside of class.","This class is HARD. Its probably okay if you have a solid high school physics background but going into with with week or nonexistent prior knowledge is next to impossible. The textbook is very dense and hard to understand and lectures move at lightning pace with the assumption that you already did and understood the reading. There are no real options for students who are struggling except getting a tutor or going to office hours every day. Unless you are going to be a physics major Physics 12 would probably be a better choice.","This class is interesting but really hard and basically took over my semester. Start the problem sets really early, go to office hours, and do lots and lots of practice problems to prepare for exams.","Obviously, anyone who hasn't done E&M before and thinks about going into physics should take this course. It's really well structured, and if you just follow along with the work, you should be fine.","This is a very difficult course. There's a ton of resources and the class is taught well, but the material is difficult. That being said, you also learn a lot (e.g. how to do the integrals you learned in 21a in various contexts). Would not recommend as a \"for fun\" course. Not sure if I'd recommend this over AP50b for engineering requirements. From what I've heard, 15b and 50b are just opposite ends of the spectrum of difficulty.","Great class, Professor Morin is amazing, can be hard to get in","They have to go to office hours and be serious on the homeworks","it's a great intro E&M class. you learn lots but don't go too deeply into anything","It's a hard class. If you need E&M but not specifically 15b, take 12b.","Class can be difficult, but covers some of the coolest explanations for how things work.","Physics 15b is a very well-organized class. Professor Morin is a pretty good lecturer in spite of the material being very dry at times and his lecture notes are very thorough. I would recommend this class if you really enjoy physics and math, but as an engineering concentrator, I found this class to be way too theoretical and abstract for me. In comparing it to my engineering classes, i found myself questioning the relevance of the concepts I was learning and while I'm sure the concepts are extremely important to know as an engineer, I felt like I was being taught to think in a whole different way and because I wasn't able to think that way, I didn't grasp the concepts very well. The problem sets are pretty time-consuming, some more than others. I would definitely only recommend this class to physics\/math concentrators. From what I've heard about the PS12 series, it sounds like a much better option for those who need to take physics for a requirement and enjoy applications more.","this course is a nice treatment of electricity and magnetism; the teaching is helpful and clear; the textbook is instructive and Morin is an excellent lecturer","This class was a great class and David Morin is a solid teacher. That being said, if you have a good Physics C background, the course may not seem to offer much new material. However, it is a good refresher of a lot of stuff in Physics C that may have been fuzzy. You will also learn the proper way to do magnetism (using electrostatics and relativity to derive it), more about electromagnetic waves, and AC circuits. Physics 153 is certainly an option, and this course really does not provide that much beyond Physics C, but for what it does provide, it is worth it.","The class is challenging, but there is sufficient support if needed, and professor Morin is an amazing lecturer.","You will learn a lot. That doesn't mean you'll do well on the tests, because you may not have learned \"enough.\" But you will learn a lot, and gain a much more theoretical understanding of E and M than if you take Applied Physics 50b (I took 50a, and I'm fairly sure that 50b would have been similar in style to 50a). Take this course if you want a theoretical understanding with a strong math component, and if you're not afraid of work\/lower grades.","Pretty difficult but worth the time if you have it.","Well, it was a requirement for me, so I guess you have to take it no matter what. But David Morin and Amir Yacoby are really nice","I really enjoyed physics 15b and felt like I got a lot out of it.","Take Physics 15b when Professor Morin is teaching! He's a great lecturer and also very understanding, so he makes the course much easier.","Don't shy away from this course if you lack prior knowledge of, or intuition about, E&M!  This is truly a well-taught introductory course.  This spring's teaching staff (I had Prahar as a TF, Morin as professor) was excellent and so helpful.  I'd suggest getting some experience with spherical and cylindrical coordinates before coming in (especially if you're taking 21a, 23b, or some other multivariable calc class concurrently), but otherwise, this is a good, self-contained course that covered a lot while not boring the students who had taken Physics C:E&M already.  Do note, however, that a lot of students already have experience with the material so, if you don't, be prepared not to quickly skim through problem sets (and don't be discouraged that it takes a little more time, it'll be worth it).  Proofs that are worked into lecture are often short, and almost always enlightening.","Morin is a fantastic teacher. His lectures are so clear and well organized. PSETs are also very well written--problems are all pertinent and interesting. The course really seems to fit together well. PSI is the lone scar on the face of 15b. It is boring and really pointless. The lab TFs this year did an absolutely abysmal job, though I did think Amir himself did a very good job. Exams are very difficult, though Morin claims repeatedly throughout the course that an average grade on the exams is all it takes to do \"very well\" in the course. Overall, lecture = great, lab = horrible.","Physics 15b was a fantastic course. E+M is a very elegant theory. I found this course to be more manageable than 15a even, as the theory is so well integrated and less messy. Dan Miron, a physics major at Columbia and good friend commented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mechanics is annoying because the concepts are easy, so to make it hard the problems are messy. E+M is inherently tough so problems often involve tricks and subtle points, so problems have simpler solutions.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d While I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree entirely with this statement, I felt E+M definitely had more interesting conceptual points and was more intellectually stimulating than 15a. It definitely felt more like Stat 110 in that you had to be clever and see tricks that would simplify the solution. \r\n\r\nProfessor Morin is a master at teaching this course\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe is super helpful at OH, and understands both the subject and the many perspectives of looking at problems so that anyone can understand it, given that you put in the time and effort. Do all the exam practice problems, go to as many sections as you find helpful. Prahar and Shubhayu, the two TFs I visited consistently, were immensely vital in comprehending the material. Overall, this 15a-15b journey was special because they started to teach me how to think like a physicist.  \r\n\r\nI think the only prerequisites you need for this course is the ability to take derivatives and integrals comfortably, and familiarity with 21a\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gradient, curl, div, and different coordinate systems. Even then, 15b was a super helpful review of these vector calculus concepts and in someways did what 21a could not\u00e2\u20ac\u201dprovide a solid physical understanding of grad ,curl, div, and functions of multiple variables. Finally, an interest in the idea of electromagnetism and the physics itself is helpful \u00e2\u02dc\u00ba \r\n\r\nThere is very little I would do to improve the course. The material is so well standardized and organized, and the TFs all add their own flavors and problems in section, making each one worthwhile (although at some point, you have to stop going to physics sections and start caring about other coursework!). PSI sometimes felt tiring (I signed up for a 7-10pm one at the end of a long day of classes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not the best idea), but even then the concepts are more interesting than 15a\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counterpart, and it definitely helped me see the applications and the tangible aspect of E+M (after all, all these field lines are invisible, but the effects are quite visible). \r\n\r\nI also would like to thank the teaching staff. Joon, for your knowledge of so many different aspects of physics in the lab. Matt and Monica, for sharing your experience as physics graduate students and showing me a new perspective that a chemist\/biologist doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite see usually. Amir, for beings upper kind and cheerful every PSI and for making the process as innovative as it can be. Prahar, for creating beautiful handouts and being so dedicated to your students and explaining problems so clearly (and for your beautiful board work). Shubhayu, for never giving up on your students and always asking more questions and for being patient while we puzzled over them.","BEST E&M class one can ask for. First few Psets might seem tough, but hang in there, and the rest of the course is not that tough because a lot of the techniques discussed initially are repeated throughout.","This course is an effective way to learn E&M. It's a straightforward course, and you'll learn a lot.","This is my favorite course that I've taken so far at Harvard. It was absolutely fascinating and I looked forward to lectures every week. Doing well will require actively studying the material and devoting plenty of time to the psets.","This course is difficult, and a background in electricity and magnetism would be very helpful because we cover the material very quickly. Office hours are extremely helpful and Dr. Morin and the TFs are always willing to assist with problem sets and explanations. The textbook is good, and the worked-out solutions to non-homework problems and the worked out examples in the chapter are extremely helpful. 15b will require a substantial amount of time every week in order to learn the material and understand the problem sets properly.","this course requires the standard amount of work for a physics class at harvard. be sure to study the homeworks for the exams. the material is unbelievable, so insightful and interesting.","Good physics course, Prof. Morin was enthusiastic and very open to help you outside of class. However, the lab component was not interesting and not helpful at all to learn the material.","If you are not premed, go for it.","This class is really difficult. Being compared to physicists was difficult. I'd recommend taking a more accessible class if you are not a hardcore physics person. Very theoretical course so it was not interesting for me as an engineer. AP50b would be much easier.","This course was very difficult. I recommend reading example problems from the textbook. Nonetheless the material was fascinating and Morin was a great professor.","Definitely take it if David Morin is teaching it!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class was a stressful experience. I did not get much out of this, except limping from midterm to midterm, and the exams were so chaotic it was impossible to have any idea of our performance. Only take this if you have to or you really REALLY want to, else you will leave exhausted and frustrated.","It is fun.","I think this class is very good and I'm amazed by how much I learned about electromagnetism. This being the first year Physics 15b was taught by Philip Kim, I could definitely see some bumps during the semester. In particular, we fell behind on our schedule and then got rushed through a lot of material at the end. However, I believe that will be improved upon in future semesters. Also, the midterms and final were definitely all over the board. The first midterm was extremely difficult, but the second midterm was extremely easy. The final returned to being extremely difficult. However, despite rough patches in the class, I'm very glad I took it and would recommend it to anyone else.","Prof. Kim is an awesome teacher! This class was a lot of fun and the lab component is not too bad.","Surely the experience is highly dependent on the teacher. I found Prof. Kim (and also Prof. Prentiss, though we spent less time with her) very solid in presentation of topics, not leaving many loopholes or open ends. In fact, I have not found as strong a pedagogue in our Physics department, and I think that he will prove a very good addition in terms of enhancing our teaching.","Philip Kim is a great lecturer. Psets are relatively hard, but definitely doable and rewarding. You will have many epiphanies throughout the course, starting with the relativistic development of magnetism, through Maxwell's equations and the discovery of electromagnetic waves.","Physics 15b is a great class!  Professor Kim is an excellent professor, and I would recommend highly taking the course when he is teaching it.","This is a very challenging class, but if you are interested in physics you have to take it. The best piece of advice I could give would be to find a good study group for the problem sets - working together will get you through the course. The exams were quite difficult.","Prepare to block off a lot of time for office hours if you want to not fail the problem sets","This class is very difficult and time-consuming, but it is so rewarding. The teaching staff was incredible and the camaraderie between the students made it easier to get through. The material is inherently SO interesting, and you'll find yourself marvelling at a lot of the conclusions that are made in class. Through the lab component of the course, you will walk away with a lot of solid practical knowledge about everything from AC and DC current, transformers, etc, to how things like high and low frequency filters (all about that bass?) and dimmer switches actually work. Just an awesome class! Definitely take it if you are interested in physics!","If you're reading this, then odds are you just have to take this class, so here's my advice: taking it off-sequence is a good move. The class is much smaller and you won't be stuck with as many Physics 16 students accelerating the class to an unreasonable pace. However, do not take it if Philip Kim is teaching it. I could honestly fill several pages with descriptions of his faults as an educator, from seemingly minor things like constantly standing in front of the board so you can't see what he's writing (seems minor the first day; it'll be a lot more frustrating three months in) to more serious things like his complete unavailability outside of class and inability to structure problem sets and exams in ways that are suitable to what has been taught (there were problem sets--plural--that contained material that was not taught until after they were due). Better to suck it up and take it in the Spring if you can get Morin or another competent professor than take it off sequence with KJP.","This is a fair physics class. Professsor Kim was a very good lecturer, but was not so accessible outside of class. The TF Nick Langelier was fantastic; he really took the brunt of student questions and taught a ton in section and in office hours. Props to him. Final was brutal, though.","Your experience in 15a is not a predictor of your experience in 15b. I hated 15a but loved 15b. The material is fascinating. It's harder\/more abstract than mechanics but it's also much more interesting.  The concepts are truly amazing and Maxwell's Equations are BEAUTIFUL! Professor Kim and Nick are also awesome! Professor Kim is so down to earth and makes really funny jokes and I really enjoyed going to class. His lectures are clear (it may not so at first, but that is because E&M as a subject requires multiple looks; it's not a subject you can expect to learn at first sight. This is also the first class at Harvard where I decide to read the textbook, which is really helpful.) Nick is the best TF I have had at Harvard. He cares so much about the class, is very good at EM and at explaining the concepts, and very accessible outside of class and dedicated (a week straight of office hours before the final). With that said, the material is hard and you will have to work hard to learn the material, but chances are you will be surrounded by people that genuinely care about physics, which is magical.","Good class, but difficult.","Professor Kim is very passionate about physics and is a good lecturer, but there are not many practice problems to practice with- his questions are very different from the textbook questions and he only provides one practice exam, unlike when Morin taught it, when all possible exams for seven years were available.","Over time, as Professor Kim gains more experience with the course and writes more practice questions\/adjusts the exams, the course will greatly improve in quality. As it stands, Professor Kim is a great instructor who really is interested in fostering student understanding of the content."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"9.70","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"26","response rate":"92.31","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 15b","course_id":"4092","cat_num":"2701","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"8","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 15b","course_id":"4092","cat_num":"2701","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"14","4s":"18","5s":"12"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 15b","course_id":"4092","cat_num":"2701","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"15","4s":"5","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
