Carrie is very open to all kinds of perspectives on the works and performances we look at and is very helpful in thinking about one's final project or other issues related to the class.","TAKE THIS CLASS! Without a doubt, one of the best classes I've ever taken. You get to talk about fascinating art in a stimulating setting. I actually looked forward to class every week. Carrie is the greatest professor you could ever ask for. Seriously, I cannot recommend the class highly enough.","I had never taken anything in VES or Art History and I absolutely loved this class. It was one of my most rewarding academic experiences at Harvard and should be a requirement for all undergraduates. It taught me to critically engage with different perspectives and peel away different layers of what is real, what is fiction, and what is in between. Take this course!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.57","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.57","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 108","course_id":"5190","cat_num":"23387","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 108","course_id":"5190","cat_num":"23387","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 108","course_id":"5190","cat_num":"23387","1s":"1","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
