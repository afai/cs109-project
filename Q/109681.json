It really helped me understand how the sociological theories could be applied in very interesting and useful ways. This was also a pretty good methods class for people who are planning to do senior theses in the social sciences.","As a non-sociology major, I found a lot of the theories and concepts I learned in this course very illuminating and useful in framing my thoughts. I would definitely encourage arts and humanities students to try this course; the material is very approachable and interesting. Prof. Chang does a great job introducing novices to social movement theory.","Paul is great--very approachable and knowledgable about social movements and sociology in general. Some case studies are better than others, but discussion is usually interesting regardless. You spend 2-3 weeks on the history of Japan, Korea, and China, which is great! Good class for people with a medium interest in learning about Asia and social movements.","Professor Chang is a great instructor who is very open to discussion and hearing your views.","Great class with good vibe."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"12","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 189","course_id":"11170","cat_num":"82041","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"4","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 189","course_id":"11170","cat_num":"82041","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 189","course_id":"11170","cat_num":"82041","1s":"4","2s":"4","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
