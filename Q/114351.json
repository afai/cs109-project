Everyone would love it.","Great introduction to working with film, the decisions involved in creating a narrative, and provides the chance to explore really interesting subjects and topics.","If you have any interest in filmmaking, here's your course.","A real interest in the subject is required, otherwise the work might seem overbearing, but if you are really interested in doing it the work won't feel like work","You have an estimate for how long something will take, multiply it by 3 and you'll be safe.","You should be willing--and eager--to devote a lot of time to this class! The more you put into it, the more you'll get out of it.","only take this course if you're willing to devote your life to film","The class does require a lot of time, however ultimately the time you put in is well rewarded as you see the finished work on the screen. It's a relief and a thrill to actually learn a skill at Harvard.","If you want to be a film maker, there is no substitute for VES 50.","Take this class to start thinking about what it means to make choices that influence the message you are trying to convey.","This is an amazing class in which you learn so much about film making and get a lot of hands-on experience.","fantastic experience. this is one of the only places left in the world in which students get to use and edit with film. beautiful class. and robb is a phenomenal professor. WHAT A GOOD CLASS!!!!!","If you are willing to put the time and effort into your projects, this class will provide a ton of fulfillment.","The class was great. Everyday brought new ideas and concepts to the table, and the course immensely increased my knowledge and understanding of films"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["VES 50 is a great experience, but I would warn students that they should really be willing to put a lot of time into it. So much of the course--especially in the second semester--is shaped by your fellow students. The responsibility really comes down on the students as to whether the class will really work out or not.","This class requires a huge amount of work, however if you are interested in filmmaking at all, this is the best class Harvard offers to get into the field. The skills learned in this class can be used for video, however not vice versa.","If you have never worked collaboratively on a film before, this will require you to adjust; it will be difficult but worth it.","This class is very time-consuming, but the amount you learn and the experience you get actually creating films is well worth it.","Fantastic class. No other course in the college like it. If you want to be a storyteller, enroll.","Great class.  If you wish to take any intro-film class start here.","Take it. You will not regret it. Honestly. If you are doubting whether you want to be a filmmaker, this class will be a big help in that decision...from having to collaborate with a lot of people to having to put in hours and hours of work and care and attention, overall a very helpful class in figuring out or starting to figure out if you want to be a filmmaker. I was very uncertain and now I know I want to make films.","it's good for people who can pull long shifts of work, as going on shoots and editing can last for a long time, you should also be aware that working with 9 other people means you're not always going to get your way","This is the beginning. The leap of knowledge you'll make from not taking this course to taking this course is too vast and important to miss.","Take it!","This course is absolutely essential if you want to pursue an interest in filmmaking. But be ready to put in a lot of time and a lot of work, particularly second semester.","This class was life-changing--not only did it make me love film, but it made me realize that making films is what I want to do for the rest of my life.","Get ready to have this class take up a lot of your life."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["I am truly, madly, deeply love this class. You will spend 150+ hours on your assignments (seriously dudes, no exaggeration\/ no sarcasm) but if you were ever passionate about film, it will change your life!","This class is the most rewarding class I've ever taken, but you have to put everything into it.","Never before have I come away from a semester having learned a real world skill.  Working with film is challenging, time-consuming, but ultimately infinitely rewarding.","This is a great class for any aspiring filmmaker.  You really get to learn by doing, and there's a lot to do for this course.","You need a very particular mindset to be in this course, or a VES concentrator in general.  Personally I don't have that mindset and I'm glad I realized that through this course, though I only did after the add\/drop deadline.  REMEMBER THE ADD\/DROP DEADLINE.","Apart from the 7 hours of classtime...smh...You will spend however much time shooting and editing as you are invested in your project. Pick subjects that strongly interest you so that you can feel like every hour you spend working on it is totally worth it. If you do your best, you come out really feeling like you've successfully made film projects that you will show to others in the future and you won't regret any part of it.","It is great! You learn a lot by hands on experience. But it is A LOT of work. Countless hours in the studio slaving away on a steenbeck. But it is worth it. However it does get frustrating because you feel that your film can never be completely perfect... but then again an essay is the same way.","This course has easily been one of my favorite courses at Harvard.  If you are interested in film making or in VES of any kind I highly recommend this course.  This course really gives you a chance to become very close with a group of students with similar interests and also gives a lot of one on one time with your professor.","Alfred Guzzetti is gonna kick your butt if you don't make a good film, no question."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is probably the best course in the VES is department. You gain a ton of skills, but you don't sacrifice creativity for the sake of mindless exercises that improve your technique. This course gives you all the room you need to be creative with your documentary","It's a learning experience...","Great course, amazing instructors.  If you plan on taking this course do not have anything else to do in April or November.  If you want to take away from this course you have to throw yourself completely into the project and step up when your classmates don't.  Be prepared to spend many hours in Sever.  It is a truly amazing course though.  My favorite thus far at Harvard.","If you want to make films, then this is sort of a no-brainer.  Accept the word of Robb into your hearts and rejoice.  Best class I've taken at Harvard.  It takes a ton of work, but remember: no matter how brutal the class may be, the class will always end at the end of the class.","I can't believe it's over.  VES 50 is one of the only chances left to work in 16mm film.  Robb is an incredibly eloquent, patient instructor. Our first name basis alone hints at how casual and communicative the class environment is.  By the end I was closer to my classmates than students in any other course.  You'll work your butt off into the wee hours of the morning, but the final product is worth it.  Shooting in film and constructing a physical reel is a powerful experience useful for all filmmaking formats.","IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME. ROBB MOSS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. ACCEPT THE ROBB.","TONS OF WORK! but you get what you put in. and the time varies. you can put however much time you wish. but if you decide not to put a lot of time into it... then it'l show. and your team will hate you.","If you're willing to fall in love with film and put in a lot of work, this is an incredible experience"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is honestly a great class.  It's extremely time consuming but a lot of fun, and is one of the most hands-on courses at Harvard.  That said, know that you're getting into a lot and that it's extremely important to pick your groups wisely, or you'll end up spending many sleepless nights at an editing table.","This is a serious, heavyweight introduction to filmmaking with a real guru, the great Robb Moss. You must be prepared to devote a lot of time to it, doing things such as editing on a Steenbeck which is simply not enjoyable. Hopefully, like me, you'll find the payoff is worth it.","Best class ever. Alfred is such a great teacher and the feedback on our work on a weekly basis is so valuable. I look forward to film every week :)","Without a doubt, this is by far my favorite class at Harvard. Robb Moss is a tremendous professor and will fill your mind with endless knowledge in regards to the filmmaking process. The class requires a TON of work (around 10-14 hours in and out of class on an easy week and easily upwards of 20+ hours in and out of class on a tough, deadline week). TF Jennifer Malin also adds a wonderful presence to the class. The teaching unit of Robb and Jenny has made the class so very enjoyable and the feedback given is astonishingly helpful and humbling.","If you love film you will love this class. If you do not then do not take a deserving student's spot!","VES 50 is the most engaging class I have taken at Harvard. It demands a lot of time and attention but is incredibly rewarding in the skills and sensitivities it develops.","you have to be serious about film to take the class cuz it does take A LOT of time. that being said, it's an awesome class, and film is simply beauuuutiful~","It's a lot of work. It will legitimately make you a better filmmaker, but by the end of it, you'll be very happy that editing on video exists. I love shooting on film now because it is incredibly different totally worth it, but expect to have to put a lot of time in it.","If you are interested in pursuing film at Harvard, this class is definitely worth it. Be aware that it is a large time commitment, but if you enjoy the work, putting in the time won't be a hassle. Also, Robb Moss is great.","50 is a great course, but be prepared to spend long hours in Sever basement slaving over manually editing film. THERE IS NO EDITING ON COMPUTERS!"]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["The VES environment itself is brilliant.  Robb Moss provides ample advice and critique without being overbearing or controlling.  Nicole was a great TF, she was the first to assist with the technical aspects of the course and provided clear critiques that really supplemented Robb's.  The community and camaraderie VES 50 generates is truly unique and pleasant.","It is a challenging class, but is wonderful. Robb and Nicole are so helpful and supportive.","This class is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.  I was given the tools and skills in the first semester to make films with incredible equipment and incredible feedback.  I will always appreciate what I learned in this class.","I feel as though this course doesn't really gently dip you into filmmaking so much as bludgeons you with the assignments until suddenly you feel like a film maker. It takes over your life for a bit, which you come to accept and embrace.","Take it seriously! You have your classmates and Robb Moss there to really help you make the best films you possibly can at this level. And the opportunity to work with 16mm is becoming rare so take advantage. Try not to get too sensitive during critiques.  Take what your classmates say and really try to see how critique can make you a better filmmaker.  On the flip side...try not to be a douche when giving your opinions on your classmates films.  In general, be proactive about filming and editing! A lot of energy and a \"go get em\" attitude\" will produce results in this course.","You must take this class.","If you are interested at all in working with film, this is the only course to take (followed by 150, etc.).  Robb Moss is an icon and Harvard retains one of the few 16mm undergraduate programs in the country.  Be prepared to put in 10 or more hours at a time editing during the crunch time before projects are do, but take this course.","This class is amazing. Robb is amazing.  It is incredibly time-consuming, but absolutely worth it if you have a sincere interest in filmmaking.","Be prepared to want to make something wonderful, or you won't get everything you could out of the class. It requires a dedication to the work and to your classmates. Really invest in other people's projects too, or you won't learn everything you could. By having a give and take with others, you will get a lot more experience and will benefit when it comes your turn to need some help. Be flexible and be available. It's so great!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is time consuming, challenging and amazing all at the same time.  If you have any interest in filmmaking at all, then take it.  The opportunity to work in actual film won't be around for much longer.  And Robb is one of the (if not THE) best professors I've ever had.  Nicole is also one of the best TFs I've ever had.  Take this course, just be prepared to put in many, many hours of work.","VES 50 is such a unique experience - when will you get to work with a 12 person group for a year on 16mm film again? It is perhaps the most helpful filmmaking experiences one can have at Harvard, and one through which I made several very good friends along the way (going on film shoots can be a very bonding experience!). It was a pleasure being part of this course.","If you love movies and you want to learn what it takes to make them yourself, take this class, but only if you want to learn a lot more than the video students and you have more time than them to spend at it.","The making of a class film is tough but if you open up to the idea and let yourself mesh into this idea of a group vision (not just your own) you'll so many valuable lessons about the nature of collaboration and what it means to make an actual film. In terms of practical advice, you must must must be proactive about shooting and later in the term editing. Go for it! And try to be as organized as possible during the editing phase. I mean it. BE ORGANIZED. You'll save yourself many stressful hours later.","Unless you are a person of great resources and ambition, it is very likely that you will never in your life shoot and edit in 16mm film and magnetic-tape sound.  If you have any interest in becoming a critically-thinking, independently minded filmmaker or really even just a smart person, you must try to take this course.  I spent many an evening in the basement of Sever -- working on the Steenbeck flatbed editors, running the film back and forth through the machine, feeling the images with my hands, eyes frantically searching for my grease-pencil edit marks so that I can put the film back in sync with the now present, now disembodied sound, starving and tired, my head drooping low as I wait for my movie to rewind or fast forward or locate itself anywhere specific -- but this process, combined with the long hours talking about our films and other films and so many only-cursorily-related things in Sever B10, hours that later on in the fall seem to pass so quickly, has pressed and compressed me into a much stronger and more thoughtful person.  I entered the class fairly confident of my ability to really see and converse about film, but only now that I have crossed the river can I truly say I know how cold the water feels.","This class is a great experience. At times it's a very frustrating and time-consuming experience, but a great experience nonetheless. I learned something about the unending effort it takes to make something that's worth another person's time, which was a really powerful lesson.","This is not a class for the faint of heart.  The benefits of this course are directly proportional to the amount of effort you contribute.  Brilliant teaching staff-- your work receives sincere critique twice per week, and extra help sessions are always readily available to schedule.  If taken with sincerity, you will leave this class with a sturdy film foundation: recognizing compelling imagery, offering useful critiques, learning how to absorb and apply criticisms and more.  Great class.","You just need to be willing to put in the time. Do something every week. You can sleep until the end, but then you will have no work in the movie, and you'll feel disappointed. It's so so worth it to get everything you can out of this class. It's such a cool opportunity to be working with Robb and this equipment. Be ready for a learning experience in team work. And be ready for late late nights."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This class can be really time consuming due to the sheer editing time you put in on the Steenbeck, however the product is immensely rewarding.","Everybody should take this class. If you think that this is only for VES concentrators, then you're dead wrong. Only three people in our class were concentrators, but I think all of us enjoyed. This class will teach you life skills beyond just those required by filmmakers. Aside from the patience that you'll acquire from having to work on your films, you'll also become a more creative thinker. Film is only a means to acquiring these skills. Come into this class with an open mind and an eagerness to learn. Whether you're starting off with video experience like I did or with no experience at all, there's something for you to learn. This is a class that you will never, ever forget.","This class is an investment, and definitely not light on work, but if you're genuinely interested in learning film, there isn't a better way.","Great course to take, even if it doesn't seem applicable to the modern day digital video world, it teaches you a lot about the filmmaking process and film is very fun to work with","If you have interest in film, and especially documentary film, this is your class. It's a lot of time spent with the cameras, so you have to enjoy what you're doing, but you'll come out with a solid knowledge of the techniques of filmmaking.","Anyone who really loves film and wants to work with it in the future should take this class."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["The best class I took at Harvard. It's a lot of work, but worth every second","This course is THE COURSE to take if you have any aspirations of becoming a documentary filmmaker.  You will leave with a newfound skill set and an enormous appreciation for documentary filmmaking.  This class is certainly time-consuming but it is well worth the time and effort.  Also, be aware that for better or worse, the other students in the class will largely define your experience for the year (and more so than in other classes due to the long class periods and time-intensive nature of the work).","You have to be okay with doing the tedious things. If you love film, you'll be able to do it.","VES50 is a fantastic introduction to the world of filmmaking. You learn all the relevant aspects of production in a hands-on environment and come out thinking like a filmmaker. Alfred is super knowledgable and helpful throughout the course.
