'09":{"comments":["Its helpful but not enough if you want to introduce yourself into literary theory."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["It might be painful sometimes to learn that everything can be deconstructed and everything you do and think is based on a long series of assumptions, but this course will prepare you for being a literature scholar - if you can take it and get something out of it (and particularly if you enjoy it) this is a field for you.","Greatly professor-centered and, then, not all professors truly prepared their interventions.","Make sure that you approach this course with an open mind and do not stress about trying to understand all the theory perfectly. Find something that interests you and focus on that.","The course is a good example of Western Literary theory, with intelligent approaches from the speakers and interesting readings.","It's a very fun class. A lot of work involved but we learn from such eclectic fields that it makes it very interesting and fun."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["The class is an overview of various unrelated subjects.","If class structure is reorganized then I would recommend it with enthusiasm. The course has the potential to be tremendously interesting, but a more careful selection of readings is necessary","I would recommend the course, albeit with a few caveats. It is required for RLL grads, but I would even recommend to outside students. There are a few things wrong with the course, but these are largely easy fixes with disproportionate ramifications. All in all, it is a great idea imperfectly executed.","Prepare to be bombarded by French, at times almost non-sensical, obscurantist critics.","Though it's not officially a survey course, part of the reason I enrolled was because I wanted a broader exposure to theory, but the best part of the course wasn't the readings. It was the weekly presentations by professors in the RLL department (occasionally with joint-appointments in comp lit and wgs). They were truly great and I enjoyed attending class every week."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Great way to get to know the professors in the RLL department, and a good introduction to (mainly french) theory."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["A very interesting and valuable course, but difficult for someone with little background in theory. I wish I could take the class again, knowing what I know now.","Make sure to spend times with the reading and come to class with questions and issues already formed in your mind.","Stimulating, dynamic course with professors who really care and put in a real effort to make it engaging and worthwhile.","The discussion is often quite compelling; the issues are wide-ranging and integral to literary analysis; often, however, your voice can be subordinated to that of the prof."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you already have a background in theory, Schnapp and Hamilton's erudite insights will be really helpful to you and their innovative approach will help you connect thinkers around issues through time. If you have no theoretical background, this is a tough first class to take.","If you believe that studying literature is a matter of thinking (better: of learning in order to think deeply) this is the best course that you can imagine!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"9.99","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"8","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ROM-STD 201","course_id":"4469","cat_num":"0934","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ROM-STD 201","course_id":"4469","cat_num":"0934","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ROM-STD 201","course_id":"4469","cat_num":"0934","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
