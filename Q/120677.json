'09":{"comments":["Great class! I you are strongly considering concentrating in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality this class is probably for you. Also the class will be small and the professor will be extremely accessible and open to your thoughts. This concentration really cares about its students as individuals; I may be biased, but it is truly the best at Harvard. The entire faculty knows you by name and has a genuine interest in your future and your passions.","You learn a lot, it is challenging, and a lot of fun!  Readings and discussions are excellent.","You will not find a better introduction to this field!  The material is outstanding."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This is a great introduction to WGS. You'll come out of it feeling grounded in a lot of feminist and queer thought and really excited to take your studies in a particular direction. The class gives us contact with a variety of subjects within WGS, but deeply enough so that we can begin to think about what we want to do academically and further.","This class is very difficult. If you don't like theory, it may be the most painful 2 hours.","The course is a great introduction to ideas and questions in WGS; it also provides a critical way of thinking about gender, race, sexuality, nationality and class.","This class gives you rigorous tools with which to think and learn.  The content is also super interesting, but the lens that WGS gives you is truly incredible.  These tools are unlike any other I have found at Harvard--I highly recommend this course!","This class is a foundational course that serves to not only inform but empower WGS concentrators with texts and conversation. Be prepared for great readings and engaging conversation"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is very core-concept\/theory heavy, so be prepared to read some tough texts, but you will get a lot out of it if you engage and really do the readings.","It's very basic. I guess you take it if you're going to be a WGS concentrator. So you really have no choice, right?","Well, if you are a WGS major, you have to take this class. Hopefully it will be better in the future. I would just recommend going in and speaking to the professor and TF if you are feeling lost or unsatisfied with the sections.","While the material was very interesting, I did not like the discussion environment whatsoever. I really wish it had been a smaller class. This would've produced a more comfortable environment for discussion rather than a high-stakes atmosphere in which I felt overwhelmed and intimidated.","It was great!","This is a great course. You learn so much about feminist theory, and Robin does a great job at creating a safe, intellectually stimulating, and engaging classroom.","It is a wonderful tutorial. Makes you fall even more in love with WGS. Hopefully Robin continues to teach it!","Professor Bernstein is amazing and you should take this class (and any other class) you can with her."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["I expect that this class will be a foundational one for me, both in my academic career as a college student, but more broadly in life as a self-identified feminist, as a person who has thoughtful relationships with other people, as a citizen, as a person trying to \"do good\", whatever that may mean... I loved the syllabus, and its organization allowed us to notice how different thinkers and ideas have developed, influenced, and criticized one another over time. The classroom was very comfortable and a strong rapport developed between students. More than anything, I am grateful for the friendships I developed in this class, as I expect they will push my thinking furthest. This is a class that will continue on even now that it's ended, I think.","This is everything you hoped WGS might be, and so, so much more. TAKE THIS CLASS - you will absolutely not regret it, and it will absolutely change your life.","Love love love this class. Friendly, open, and safe atmosphere to discuss very difficult yet liberating concepts.","This class gets you doing the important thinking about how to be in the world and also gives you really important foundational knowledge not just for WGS, but for college in general.","This class is excellent.  It's so incredibly satisfying to have an ambitious syllabus with lots of key terms and concepts to cover, and then spend every single class just deconstructing and delving into the readings and trying to understand them from as many perspectives as possible.  It has basically confirmed what I love about WGS-- learning with a small group of people I respect and feel comfortable with, in a challenging but compassionate environment.  Amazing.  Take it.","This was a fulfilling and eye-opening course that taught me some essential foundational ideas about gender, sexuality, and identity.","This class was great! The class was well run and helped you think about many different topics critically!","best class.","Awesome and incredible. Really makes you take a critical look at how to produce knowledge responsibly and rigorously."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.80","enrollment":"14","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"WOMGEN 97","course_id":"4903","cat_num":"7217","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"WOMGEN 97","course_id":"4903","cat_num":"7217","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"6","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"WOMGEN 97","course_id":"4903","cat_num":"7217","1s":"3","2s":"6","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
