The lectures can be a little bit dry but they are still so good because you can tell the professor is so passionate about the Byzantines. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!","This course does an excellent job of demonstrating the complexity and significance of Byzantine history. Prof. Angelov and Ece both are wonderful teachers.","I loved this class. Prof. Angelov and Ece are wonderful! And the trip to Dumbarton Oaks in DC was icing on the cake. The workload and readings are definitely manageable and they give you plenty of advanced notice. This class was EXTREMELY well-organized and if you're at all interested in Byzantine History (as I was) TAKE THIS COURSE. Even if you're not, take it because you will be.","I really learned a lot\r\nI recommend the class because it covers a significant time period and geography as well\r\nThe course material is really very good. I loved the bibliography provided  as well as the electronic sources and lectures","The teaching staff are awesome and engaging. Take this course if you're interested, but be careful if you're not used to writing analytical papers.","Interesting material. The paper grading is erratic, but the test\/assessment questions were fair. Both the professor and the TF were very kind people who took a genuine interest in their students.","There is definitely a desire to serve the students (as evidenced by our free trip to Washington DC), though lectures could be disorganized and expectations not always the clearest.","If you're passionate about this area in history, this is the perfect class.","This course, while informative, is not particularly enjoyable."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.30","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"2.30","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"40","response rate":"62.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1035","course_id":"2391","cat_num":"42244","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"9","5s":"12"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1035","course_id":"2391","cat_num":"42244","1s":"4","2s":"9","3s":"10","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1035","course_id":"2391","cat_num":"42244","1s":"8","2s":"14","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
