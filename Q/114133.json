But the two-professor format and other problems make the course sometimes incohesive.","This is an outstanding course that every economics student should take.  It provides an excellent introduction to the field of psychology and economics and helps you re-think the logic of many of the economic models studied.  For non-economics or math students, I strongly recommend this course, but as it is rather difficult, I suggest taking it pass-fail.","This class is excellent for anyone who has doubted the universality of economic theory. It allows you to take a look at how people actually behave rather than how they should behave, which can be very interesting.","Interesting and applicable course.","extremely interesting class, yet beware of the less interesting problem sets which are more difficult than they need to be.","It is an amazing course, but the grading is harsh.","A really fun course without too much work outside of class.  You will have to deal with the wild swings of lecture ability between Laibson and Shleifer, but it all ends up being positive in the end.","A laidback class for those looking for a little bit of fun in the course schedule, though attendance is mandatory, which might or might not be unfortunate. Not suitable for students looking for a math-based econ class.","It starts off great but is really not intellectually stiumulating after the first few weeks","I have already recommended it to every other PhD student in my department (computer science) who looks at AI and decision-making. I think it's essential for understanding how little we know when it comes to really predicting human behavior, even in its simplest forms of expression, but also for learning what the main lines of thought are in tackling this extremely complicated problem.","LOVED IT!","If you've never studied this stuff before, it's worth learning about.","Incredibly interesting material, with great professors + problem sets.","Interesting material and easy.","A very good course where the academic reputation of the Professors is truly matched by their quality in teaching.","Great way to see how economics doesn't fully explain human behavior and the steps that economists are taking to fix that.","If you can deal with the fact that you will be evaulated oalmost entirely based on your understanding of mathematical models that are sorta covered in lecture but not thoroughly and different from teh ones in lecture then by all means take it.

To the extent that classical economic theory does a very bad job at describing how humans make decisions, this class offers an important (and rare) perspective on why this is the case and how economists are trying to revise the standard models.

Its interesting at first, but only take it if you also like finance because it is deceiving at first.","You will definitely learn a lot of interesting concepts in this class, but you will also have to work hard to earn a good grade.","This course is a great way to learn how to improve your decision making and learn about why people act the way they do.","I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the subject and is willing to attend every lecture.","Shleifer's lectures are completely boring, but Laibson's are really cool and make the course worthwhile.

Proffesor Schleifer's lectures are boring a lot of the time.","Great course. Professors are really interested in the material and interested in helping students.","This class is very difficult and not very well-organized. They don't provide any useful material (review questions, past exams) to help prepare for the final. Sections were also pretty unorganized and didn't really cover relevant material beyond deriving the equations in a way that not many people understood. Laibson's lectures are fantastic though and great to listen to. Shleifer covers some interesting topics but he is a pretty boring lecturer so it's hard to pay attention. It would help to have some background with finance for this class as the behavior finance stuff can get tricky if you don't have previous knowledge. Overall, it's an interesting but difficult course.","This class is incredibly interesting. Definitely take it if you're interested in behavioral economics.","A chance to learn about the merger of the principles of economics and psychology","Really interesting material if you like economics and psychology.  Some lectures are great; some are really boring.  Some problem sets were easy and straightforward; others were difficult, tedious, and confusing.  The TFs were on the whole unprepared and incompetent, but most of the material could have been learned from lecture slides.","Great class!! Lectures and material is incredibly good. The professors are fantastic. More Math than you expect.","This is by far the best class I have ever taken.  It is incredibly interesting and was so good.","Behavioral economics is really interesting. If you've taken the 1011 series or other advanced math-y classes, the math here is easy. (If you've only taken Ec 10 and no math, it might be a bit trickier.) However, this class is maybe not as inspiring as it could be, and the problem sets and exams are fairly technical\/detail-oriented.","Some of the material is really cool, and it's cutting edge. Plus you are taught by the people that created some of the most important models in behavioral economics.","There's a big disconnect between lecturers and between lectures and section.  The first week of Laibson lectures will give you a high decision utility, but the experienced utility of the course in general is quite low.  You will learn a lot but in the midst of the course it's hard to feel like there are overarching themes.","This course was amazing. Probably one of the only ones on behavior economics taught at Harvard. David Laibson is definitely a spectacular lecturer and Andrei Schleifer is truly a genius in economics. The course does require some math so be sure to be comfortable with that if you are considering taking the course. Otherwise not much work for this course outside of problem sets. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in behavioral economics.","This class is really interesting, especially if you are interested in the overlap between economics, math, and psychology. The behavioral theories are so interesting because they describe decisions we make in every day life in a mathematical way. The problem sets are manageable. The lectures are enjoyable on the most part.","Very nice class to take as an applied math requirement because there is not really much math in it at all.","you'll learn a ton but you've got to work. take advantage of the professors as much as you can. this stuff really applies to life, unlike a lot of econ courses at Harvard!","Prof. Laibson is awesome, but Prof. Schleifer is one of the most boring professors I have ever had.  Material is very interesting, but skip Schleifer's lectures.  Problem sets were not too hard, you only have to do 6 out of 8 too.","Great Class!","Interesting material but the presentation could have been better. The course was somewhat disorganized and it was hard to integrate all the concepts. Also some of the more mathy models were difficult to understand. That being said, the emerging field of behavioral economics is extremely fascinating, and Professors Laibson and Schleifer are the leaders of that field. Much of the class is centered around their research so it's pretty cool to be able to take a class with them.","This class won't exist in the future.","The course material is fascinating and the workload is relatively minimal. If you've taken other Econ classes that overlap, there are a lot of similarities (meaning less work for you!).","Great professors, interesting material. Exams are tougher than expected.","Interesting but quantitatively demanding","This class may not be offered any more, which is unfortunate for you because I think it is a great class! If you are interested in studying how human beings systematically errs understanding the underlying decision-making process, this is the right class for you. Hopefully the professors will decide to continue teaching it. Otherwise you can take the close substitute (the packing problem) in the fall.","There are definitely flaws with the class, but overall this class is absolutely fascinating. Professor Laibson's lectures were probably the only lectures so far at Harvard that I have always looked forward to and was disappointed that they were over.","very interesting class with great professors","Take this course! Unfortunately, Prof. Shleifer is not going to teach it again but Prof. Laibson is superb!","This can be an interesting class, but if you're an ec concentrator, you will have seen a lot of the material already.  Professor Laibson is excellent, but Professor Schleifer is not the most dynamic lecturer.  Also, be aware that there is a large section of this course devoted to behavioral finance, so if that's something you're not interested in, maybe think twice about enrolling.","Take notes on the lecture printouts","Fun, interesting material, but not as easy as you might think","This class presents an excellent opportunity to learn more about the budding field of behavioral economics.","This class is really interesting--it presents completely new material & shows a different way of thinking. I would tell future students, however, that the psets take a really long time & are pretty stressful to complete (but you can drop 2 so its not that bad). I really liked the small experiments we have after class--fun! The professors are great-- they are always available to get in touch with you and they are very friendly & nice.","Take it! I think it's a pretty important caveat to the rest of the economics courses you'll take.","This class is confusing. It's taught assuming students are familiar with lots of math, which may confuse some. There is not really a strong connection between lecture and section, and the problem sets\/tests don't seem to relate to lecture and section in obvious ways. The material is fascinating, but be prepared to spend a lot of time making sure you know every minute detail and iteration of the problems you encounter.","If you're comfortable with math\/modeling (have taken 1011a), this course will be significantly easier for you. If you're not as familiar with these methods, it's great to take pass\/fail","This is a very good course. It is a little all over the map but touches on some very interesting topics and will change the way you think about advertising, decision making, and other interesting areas of application.

Also, prof. Laibson is excellent in every way.","Not an easy course, but fascinating and exciting material. Highly recommended.","Great course, but beware of the work. It is time consuming and hard.

Laibson is the man and the material is super applicable to your life. Take this class! Don't be afraid!","Very, very quantitative class. Frustrating because much of the material tested on\/on psets is unrelated to lecture. Course needs to be much better connected. Interesting material, but this is not an easy econ class.","Laibson is an awesome lecturer, I don't know if he is teaching it again but if so, he is the reason to take the class.","Very interesting, very fun class if you have any interest in behavioural economics. Both professors, especially Professor Laibson, made an effort to make us understand and appreciate models. Not overtly mathy, but don't be math phobic if you take it. Grading may seem arbitrary.","It can be a difficult to get the math if that is not your forte, but it's manageable if you just run over the problem set because each of the concepts has a distinct mathematical process that you can master through memorization. The exams were pretty reasonable (and much easier than the psets) so you'll be fine if you just run over past exams to see how they manipulated the math. It's never as hard as you initially think, but I definitely had to work in this class to understand it all. The material itself was interesting and is, to me, a more honest look at where classical economics fall short. These ideas in behavioral ec should make future ec classes more interesting as it provides a perspective from which to question\/probe.","This class is not easy, but is one of the most interesting economics classes you can take at Harvard. Instead of focusing on unrealistic models where Supply meets Demand, etc., you actually learn about how real, sometimes irrational people make economic decisions. Professor Laibson is a fantastic and approachable teacher.","Take it with Laibson!","This class is great. The psets in the beginning are a lot harder than at the end, so don't be scared by the first two psets it got easier. I think that this class was very fair and well taught. It is really great the second half of the semester.","take if you're interested in psychology, the quantification of behavior, in realizing the critical perspectives to economics.  a good amount of math, some interesting material - sections and lectures could have been better, but still learned a lot","A great survey course in behavioral economics. Laibson is a great dynamic lecture, Tomasz less so but he tries hard nonetheless. The midterm and final are fair and straightforward and test material directly from problem sets and lectures. Problem sets are often nuanced and grading may be a little bit subjective. Great class, learn a lot of very interesting stuff giving you a new perspective on economics while not being overworked. TAKE IT!","Laibson is a great lecturer, but Tomaz often mixed up examples, got confused by his own slides, was disorganized.. It was his first time teaching this course, so he will probably improve next year, but some of his lectures were painful to watch as he stumbled over himself and the material he was supposed to be teaching us. There were slides with pure math (and no real explanation), and often even the TFs didn't really know what he was trying to get across with his slides\/examples.\r\nThe problem sets in the beginning of the class were really cumbersome (no way to do them without office hours), and the TFs were not very helpful, but things got better as the course went on. This year we had all new TFs and a new professor, so things were understandably shaky for the first third of the semester.\r\nAlso, for the field of behavioral economics in general, after a while it starts to feel silly trying to model things like procrastination using numbers and equations, but that could just be my own personal feelings about it.","It's an excellent subject with a good teaching staff.","Very interesting material, but challenging if you're not on top of your stuff and just want to cram and procrastinate.","Laibson's lectures are good and the material is very interesting and applicable to real life. However, make sure the TFs don't suck.","Great class! Not very difficult but still learned a lot.","If Tomasz is not teaching and Laibson is, then definitely take it.","well it's not going to be offered again anyways, so what's the point? tomaz, i appreciate your enthusiasm but your self-deprecating humor was very distracting from the actual topic. the lectures were fairly easy to follow, but did not prepare us well for the problem sets. laibson is a great lecturer!! and he was a marshall scholar! super cool! the mistakes on the lecture slides because it was copy and pasted from last year made it seem like the instructors didn't pay too much attention.","get ready to do a lot of math.  at the same time you learn a lot and it changes how you think about your own decision making","Professor Laibson is a great lecturer.  One thing you should know before taking the course though: we never really discussed the problems that we had to solve in the problem sets during lecture, only in section.  Office hours are really useful though."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is a great introduction to the big ideas of behavioral economics. The professors did a good job of provoking critical thought during lectures, and section leaders did well in providing the intuition each week for the problem set of the previous week.","The material is interesting, yet  I didn't really like the problem sets. At times there was less of a connection between lectures and problem sets.","It seems like it will be interesting, but lectures will be difficult to pay attention to and problem sets much too difficult.","This class is quite dry. The material is more difficult than anticipated.","I have mixed reviews for this course. First, the good. David Laibson is a world leader in the field of behavioral economics, and much of the topics discussed in the course involve his research, which is something that you can only find at Harvard. He is the single best part about the course. His lectures are engaging, exciting, and relevant, and he hosts lunches in Houses towards the end of the semester to meet and get to know students. He also makes a sincere effort to learn the names of everyone who asks questions or comments in class. I learned how to live a better life through this course. However, the other lecturer, Tomasz, is much weaker (though improving), and sometimes seems confused by questions and the material. There are ten problem sets, though you can drop two, and they are fairly difficult. They require a good 2-5 hours to complete, and can be frustrating at times, as there are very few examples of how to solve the problems before they're due, and the teaching staff isn't the most accessible or helpful. Sections simply went over the previous weeks' problem sets, which was not helpful at all in preparing for the next week's problem set (though they changed this towards the end of the semester based on feedback). The midterm was fair, though the curve was strict, and it was not easy to get an A or A-. The final was very difficult, with the time constraint being inhibiting. Grading tends to be on the tough end, with the syllabus reading \"we worry about grade inflation at Harvard, and this course will not be a grade gut.\" Overall, an interesting course with relevant and engaging material, though the teaching fellows and section are fairly weak, and the exams and grading are most strict than most courses, and more than they need to be. I hesitated to take the course for this reason, and in hindsight, should have taken it pass\/fail.","This course really teaches you what the behavioral biases are and how they operate in a concrete manner. Merely becoming more aware of your own behavioral biases is likely to significantly improve your ability to make decisions and conduct analysis.","Ec 1030 is a good course that covers a lot of different topics and definitely gives you a more accurate view of how people act and make decisions. The problem sets can be difficult and take a fair amount of time, and the exams (especially the final!) were fairly difficult, at least in my opinion. But if you're interested in the topic, you should take it -- it is rewarding!","As far as Economics courses go, this one is not terribly difficult and often touches upon interesting subjects. However, the dual-professor structure of the course means that roughly half the lectures will be less than stellar, and students must be proactive and reach out to the teaching staff if they want to receive any sort of thorough feedback on their work.","Take it, but don't feel the need to go to class if David isn't teaching.","The course covers a broad range of topics in psychology and behavioural economics. There is a lot of focus on the material in the lectures with little outside sources, so it is important to attend those. Section is a little ineffective considering that it is simply to go through previous problem sets to which the solutions are posted online. The readings reinforce the material provided in the lectures but are not necessary in order to get the most out of this class.","this class is easy but also not very rewarding. you won't feel like you've learned something important at the end of the semester. prospect theory is cool, but the rest of the class is all over the place and scatterbrain (especially the second half of the class). lecture's move at a snail's pace. little material is covered, and it takes forever.","A very interesting class. However, the topics and models covered are closer to an intermediate microeconomics course than a psychology course (i.e. behavioural economics). If you like econ\/ micro and want to take a course with moderate workload that covers interesting applications, take this course!","Topics are very interesting. Psets are tricky but not too much work.","Where do I start? Ok, first with the good: Professor Laibson is great. Obviously super charismatic and excited about the material, definitely made everything really clear. That's the only good thing. Tomasz, the second professor, often was confused about his own slides or failed to explain material in an effective manner, leaving the class confused. Sections are pointless. You basically just spend the whole time going over the pset THAT YOU ALREADY TURNED IN. Because solutions to the psets are posted the day that they're due, the fact that entire sections are spent going over these solutions THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE ONLINE is quite frustrating. If there are questions about the turned in homework, people can go to office hours. I don't understand why we can't go over material discussed in lecture\/readings\/or the upcoming pset. But at least the psets were fairly easy. Still don't feel like I truly learned anything that I couldn't have guessed at before.","The final is significantly more difficult than the midterm.","Interesting class, good lectures. Does tend to overlap with several other classes so is better earlier rather than later. Would probably not recommend to someone who has already had a lot of exposure to the topics.","The material you learn in this course is super-applicable to your life. The material can be confusing if you are not comfortable with math, but if you are then it's actually very cool how much can be learned about human behavior \/ decisionmaking just via some pretty basic models.","Great material and gives you a new way to think about economics and classical predictions.","This class is an interesting look into the very interesting and exciting field of behavioral economics. The subject material is fascinating, and though the material doesn't feel very mathematically rigorous at times, the models typically end up being good ones. Problem sets are easy, lectures are typically extremely engaging, and the subject is a great one, but do be prepared to find the math slow and\/or lacking.","This is an amazing course that has been one of my favorite that I have taken in my three years at harvard.  The lectures are engaging and the material has some really interesting real world applications.","Great overview of behavior economic concepts combined with practical learning in assignments and philosophical debates about the ethics.","It is harder than it looks.  Very mathy and not very organized.","A must-take course for anyone who is interested in economics; it provides excellent complements to standard economics theories.","Very cool concepts!","This is an awesome course! If you are an economics major and want to know how you can think more realistically based on your knowledge in economics, definitely take this course. If you aren't an economics major but want to understand your own bias and decision making process, definitely take this course!","This course was not what I expected. There were two more problem sets than on the original syllabus, so you should check to make sure they are telling you the truth. The problem sets are also ridiculous compared to the lectures. Laibson is a great lecturer, but Tomaz is almost unbearable.  Overall, not what I expected and way more of a pain than I expected.","The course material could be very very interesting, but it's taught in a very dry, simplistic way. The workload is light, but the exams are not easy. If you need an econ or psych requirement out of the way, then consider this course -- otherwise I'd look elsewhere.","Laibson is interesting, but the material is pretty slow\/simple and the TF staff were unimpressive.","If you are interested in behavioral economics, this is a good course to take. Harvard does not have too many offerings in this field. Lectures are ok, experiments are fun, psets are where you get the most out of the course.","This is an incredibly interesting class, but is not well structured. The material is absolutely fascinating, but the teaching staff is pretty unaccessible, the pests are confusing, and the class doesn't seem to be a priority for the professors, Overall, though, I think what I learned in the class makes it worth it, and Laibson is a great lecturer.","Lectures, especially Laibson's, can be interesting - however, the psets are tedious and overall the course can seem less interesting than expected.","Laibson = GREAT\r\nTomasz = not. \r\nI went into this class with very high expectations, hopes, and excitement levels. I was let down, mostly by Tomasz's lectures. The material taught by Laibson was very much more like what I was expecting, but that was only for the second half of the semester unfortunately."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"3.60","enrollment":"85","response rate":"67.06","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1030","course_id":"960","cat_num":"4709","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"20","4s":"18","5s":"9"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1030","course_id":"960","cat_num":"4709","1s":"3","2s":"8","3s":"29","4s":"16","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1030","course_id":"960","cat_num":"4709","1s":"13","2s":"32","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
