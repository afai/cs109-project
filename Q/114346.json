I always looked forward to going!  I just wish there were more discussion and less straight lecturing.","Great class if you really want to learn about anxiety disorders in depth.  Not easy though.","To make sure to take good notes, as they are very useful come exam time.","it is quite interesting and mcnally is funny","This is the perfect class for people who want to learn more about anxiety disorders or who want a taste of what continuing on with psychology might be like. It's very paper heavy though.","McNally is a great lecturer and a very smart guy; the course covers a lot of material; the lectures are very interesting","somewhat boring but not too hard. try to pay attention in lectures--mcnally is awesome.","boring"]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["its great!","You have to KNOW you're really into the subject matter.  If you THINK you are, and shop the first class and find yourself not bored but not excited, DON'T enroll in the course.  You'll feel tortured the rest of the semester.  The material is very in-depth and will seem very, very dull if you are not passioinate about the material.","if you enjoyed abnormal psychology (psy 18 i think), you will definitely enjoy this class.","Lectures are great and make it easy to learn. The professor knows a lot of the important researchers personally (being one himself) and tells fun stories. You come away with a lot of knowledge.","midterm\/final is difficult, memorize author names! but prof is great and material is really interesting","The class is notable for its passionate, congenial professor who is extremely knowledgeable about the topic at hand. Has an often strong point of view, which is always appreciated. Personally knows seemingly everyone in the field. Drawback is that exams are quite rigorously graded and at times unforgiving.","Professor McNally does a great job making lectures more entertaining, and he has a great sense of humor.","make sure you are aware about how specific the information in this course is. lots of studies to know\/memorize and the exams are quite difficult."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course is a lot of work","I really enjoyed this course. It was really informative to go over disorders with a professor that has had so much experience in the fiel of psychology.","Fantastic course with a great instructor.","Fantastic class! I learned so much about anxiety disorders, and I am so happy hat I took this class. Professor McNally is an extremely knowledgeable resource.","Professor McNally knows nearly everything that is currently known about this field, and his courses are interesting, in-depth, and make you think a bit more in depth about the study of anxiety disorders.","Make sure to keep up with the reading!  It's important.","Start your final paper early!","This was one of the best classes I've taken. If you're interested in research and how different studies support different arguments about anxiety disorders, you will love this class. It isn't easy, it's very fair and you'll learn a lot.
