It is a very tough course, but it is worth every second spent. One learns a lot about the AdS\/CFT correspondence and its origins. Andy is an amazing teacher and makes things very clear."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Very nice style in general; particularly the flexible nature of the presentation (very nice aspect).\r\n\r\nA particularly supportive and very understanding lecturer.","This course covers a wide range of fascinating material that you may not encounter in other physics courses. Since it's oriented around presentations and discussions, the course can be frustrating when people are unprepared.","Don't expect a comprehensive coverage of how you calculate things, different concepts, etc, in cosmology, but do expect an interesting taster menu of different topics that may inspire you to learn more on your own.","Why not? You'll learn a lot without too much stress."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.90","workload":"2.00","difficulty":"2.20","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"11","response rate":"63.64","QCourseOverall":{"number":"PHYSICS 211r","course_id":"4116","cat_num":"0469","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"4","5s":"1"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"PHYSICS 211r","course_id":"4116","cat_num":"0469","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"PHYSICS 211r","course_id":"4116","cat_num":"0469","1s":"3","2s":"2","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
