Plan accordingly.","Sebastien struggled to finish teaching survival analysis, which is one of the core topics of this course, even though the fact that he assigned take home exams meant he had way more class time than other professors. There was too much focus on linear regression and too little on new material such as binary, count and survival data, which were really interesting. The course covers interesting material, but there is room for improvement.","The content is well presented and well-taught. Sebastien is a good teacher but seems to hate questions, which I find strange. I think he just really likes to be in complete control of the class and gets flustered when people start asking questions. However, it's worth it to take the class and you get a lot out of it, especially the course notes and materials. Your R programming will very much improve as the code is directly taught in class which is nice.","This is a hard and time-consuming class.
