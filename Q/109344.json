I am interested in Operations Research, so I liked the topics covered in this class (dynamic programming and queuing systems) and I think they will be useful if I decide to continue in this area of study.","For engineers (at least in my area) I don't think the class was very useful. While interesting and a good class if you are running simulations (Monte Carlo for example), it did not apply to me as much as I thought it would."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.75","difficulty":"3.62","recommendation":"3.75","enrollment":"11","response rate":"81.82","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 222","course_id":"5284","cat_num":"78317","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APMTH 222","course_id":"5284","cat_num":"78317","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 222","course_id":"5284","cat_num":"78317","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
