'12":{"comments":["Very interesting firsthand stories about the financial crisis and the markets in general","You would be better off reading an intro book to behavioral finance than taking this course.","very interesting if you are interested in finance","It's a good course to take. Professor Lamont is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and all the lectures are interesting.","Great class that teaches you alot about the world of finance.","this is an awesome class that will help you understand why markets can be irrational. professor Lamont is a great lecturer and lectures are very entertaining. take this class!","This course offers a different perspective from the traditional view of efficient markets. Prof. Owen Lamont also brings an infectious level of enthusiasm for the topic. This has been one of my favorite classes.","This is a super class that covers a lot of interesting material in a pain-free fashion.","Great professor with fun lectures!"]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This course was useful, and not as intense as some other ec classes I've taken.","If you like math, this class is useful in seeing how working through math proves economic theories and how it bears out in practice. If you didn't enjoy Math 21a though, don't take this class!","Excellent class, although the syllabus will likely change dramatically in the event that there is a new professor. This year's curriculum was extraordinary, and it will hopefully remain in place of the older behavioral finance class.","This was a terrible course - at first it seemed extremely engaging (I had never seen contracting problems before) but the entire course was basically a variation of the same problem that is introduced in the first couple weeks. It becomes extremely boring and dry really fast because it feels like you're being taught the same thing over and over again. The material can get pretty confusing at times, and because it was the first year that it was being taught, the course was pretty disorganized and we didn't really know what to expect from the final exam.","This course gave me new insides about the financial system, as it could explain contraints and reasons why the financial instruments are designed the way they are.","Ec 1760 is a fantastic course. Professor Rampini was extremely engaging, and learning about debt and contracts was surprisingly interesting.  The problem sets were interesting and extremely manageable. Overall, the amount of interesting material that I learned was extremely high relative to the amount of work that was required from the course.","Professor Rampini has designed a fantastic course. The topics covered are a great way of connecting theory with practice. The literature and peer reviewed articles are also fascinating. However, it is important to note that there is quite a bit of math required.","Really good theoretical foundation! Unfortunately Professor Rampini, who was really a star professor, won't be teaching it next year, but the material is still interesting!","The material is a bit above the undergraduate level but Professor Rampini made it ver accessible.","It's a great introduction into economic modeling and taking a systematic approach to learning about finance.","Take this course ONLY if you are highly interested in economics and finance.","Prof. Rampini is a great lecturer. He is able to take complex issues and explain them if very understandable terms. Prof. Rampini is also very receptive to questions, often leading to interesting class discussions linking the course material to recent events in the economy.","Great professor and very interesting material conceptually, but not super practical for real world finance purposes and has a very difficult math component."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Great course for those who will go into finance and anyone else interested in human behavior in finance","Almost no time commitment with pass\/fail and relatively short problem sets and a great way to learn interesting stuff about finance that you won't learn in other classes. Highly recommend for people interested in finance. Don't think Ec1723 should really be a prerequisite, not required at all.","Econ 1760 is a very useful course for someone interested in finance. It really connects the more theoretical courses (Capital Markets and Corporate Finance) and puts the concepts that I learned from these courses into a behavioral perspective. The exams and homework assignments were also very fair and I enjoyed Professor Lamont's lectures!","pretty interesting and paper-based"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"1.90","difficulty":"3.00","recommendation":"4.20","enrollment":"27","response rate":"74.07","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1760","course_id":"1002","cat_num":"77458","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"6","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1760","course_id":"1002","cat_num":"77458","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"13","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1760","course_id":"1002","cat_num":"77458","1s":"8","2s":"7","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
