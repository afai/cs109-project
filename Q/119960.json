'08":{"comments":["It's a hybrid between a research seminar and a traditional course with very little overall structure, but each class is a great introduction to a current research topic.","if you are looking for economic theory in behavioral economics... bad choice","I felt like this class had a lot of potential and fell short. Things weren't covered in enough depth or rigor -- it was more of a survey of topics behavioral economics than depth on any one of them. David Laibson's section felt too close to his section of 2010c. Sendhil never got to economic models, instead lingering on the experiments that motivated them and then running out of time. Andrei's lectures on behavioral finance were good, but you could probably get more out of a course just on behavioral finance if that is your cup of tea. In short, its an interesting field and I enjoyed the reading and lectures, but thought the course could have had more focus, rigor, and depth.","Expect problems with the required research paper. Typical academic writing block. I was expecting this only for my third year in the PhD program.","The course is a pretty shallow overview of behavioral economics."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["Low workload, pretty easy.","Be careful about the final project.  It can require quite a bit of work.","Great material, great lectures but limited faculty interaction. You maybe able to get the same impact from the course by reading the papers and lecture notes.","Do the readings, they are a great introduction to the field."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["This is pretty much a workshop in behavioral economics, it probably ought to be called that.","Take a good look at the syllabus and make sure the topics being covered that year match your interests.","Try to take it if it's not team-taught","don't overestimate yourself"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["If you like behavioral econ, this is a great course All the models are really interesting (e.g. models of the representativeness heuristic, models of procrastination, models of limited arbitrage, models of unstable financial systems)","Great intro to behavioral economics.","An amazing whirlwind tour of recent topics in the burgeoning intersection of Economics and Psychology.","Great course, covers a wide range of topics.  Not too time consuming if you want to take it to fulfill the econ PhD distribution requirement.  Gives you enough about all topics that you can pick the ones you are interested in for your own research and go in depth if you want to.","It is a very good course, but make certain that you are very self-motivated and that you are willing to go back to your dorm room and home and work out all the math of the theories."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["We have some of the experts in the field of behavioral economics, we are fortunate to have the topic taught by them.","The course is great, but you should make sure to work out the math and begin problem sets early, since they are very difficult and important for understanding the concepts and preparing for the final. Also be aware, that the course focuses a lot more on math, than the name suggests, so be comfortable with it. Also the students are mainly PHDs and the course is quite research oriented, so as an undergrad, it was quite a different experience from what I was used to.","Laibson and Mullainathan are two of the world's most renowned behavioral economists. I would definitely recommend this course. It is not particularly challenging, especially for students who have at least some basic familiarity with math.","Lots of interesting topics. May be better geared towards sitting in on than actually taking.","Very interesting and innovative knowledge on behavioral economics.","This is a great class -- possibly the most relevant class I have taken for my current research.  It is comprehensive, entertaining, informative, and a great return on time.","An enjoyable course so as long as you are definitely interested in the field. Very heavy on the particular research agendas of whoever is teaching.","I wouldn't really recommend it for undergrads. It's very research-focused. David and Sendhil are great lecturers and the material is interesting, but I dunno. I didn't really like the course, because all of the grade differentiation depends on the final exam, for which we didn't have much preparation in terms of practice problems\/psets.","This course is an excellent introduction to the field of psychology and economics.  The student would benefit from a strong background in microeconomic theory and time to work through models independently; this requires initiative, as the class does not really \"force\" you to learn the models thoroughly (I would have benefited from more assignments).","This is probably the coolest econ course you can take as an undergrad. Behavioral economics is a really interesting field, and you get to engage directly with two stars in the field who clearly enjoy teaching the class","The models for hyperbolic discounting and the David's personal way of teaching are a tremendous help for procrastinators as me to understand their own behavior.","The course covers really interesting and fun stuff so it is quite enjoyable","Painless way to fulfill distribution.  Not particularly engaging though.","This course gives a cutting edge look at the potential of behavioral insights for economic policy."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Great lectures on very interesting topics.  Low key lectures with professors who are cutting-edge in the field.  Definitely recommend","Learn some really interesting things and are on the cutting edge of economics. If you're an undergrad you definitely have to work to keep up as a high level of modeling is expected","It is a great opportunity to learn for professors at the cutting edge of the field and gain a perspective on how to include a behavioral perspective in research.","I definitely wanted to take a behavioral economics class and the topics were indeed very interesting. Laibson, Shleifer and Mullanaithan are all very good instructors and often the topics are from their own recent research.
