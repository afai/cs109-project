Professor is awesome!","The course is incredibly fun, entertaining, and you learn a lot about the history of visual music which is something most people have no idea about.","An incredible class and one of my favorites in my time at Harvard. Frahm gives you complete freedom to pursue exactly the types of projects you want to make and as a student that's really rewarding.","This course will make you feel guilty (figure-of-speech) that you're having as much fun in school!","This is a really cool class with really cool material. It'll make you think differently about music, the medium of video, and of course those two things happening together. It was a new class, but surprisingly pretty structured. It felt a bit heavy at times, seeing as the class asks you to both analyze music videos as well as make them, so the work load is more than you may think at first.  More than anything though, it forces you to think visually and try to articulate how two forms of art come together. Professor Frahm is really sweet and tries to put together a really good semester of material, and I'm positive the analysis of the material will improve after this first year of teaching it.","TAKE THIS AND MAKE MUSIC VIDEOS","This course explores a little-known history of the relationship between video and music that has strongly shaped the landscape of music video, a vital medium today. It makes for a very relaxed yet interesting journey, and it gives students the ability to make their own music video projects, which is rare for a film studies-oriented course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"15","response rate":"86.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"VES 173","course_id":"11282","cat_num":"25495","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"10"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"VES 173","course_id":"11282","cat_num":"25495","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"6","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"VES 173","course_id":"11282","cat_num":"25495","1s":"3","2s":"7","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
