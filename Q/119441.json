The regular response papers keep you from falling behind, and as they are the only written work, this class never overwhelms you.","This course has a strange dynamic in the fact that there are native speakers and also relatively intermediate\/advanced speakers in Spanish. It is hard to feel confident in speaking if you are not as strong a speaker as some of the native speakers in the class.","This class is very interesting and enjoyable. The readings and films are varied and the discussions are very good.","I wouldn't really recommend this class.  I found the structure (1.5 hours of discussion\/slides and papers due every class) to be tedious.  The readings and films were not engaging.  Also, there were native speakers in the class, which didn't help the learning process for others.","The amount of reading seems daunting at times, but the class itself is amazing. Don't be afraid to participate!","It is an interesting class that is pretty painless.","The professor is great and the course is engaging, but only take the course if you are prepared to do the work and are pretty proficient at Spanish. Also, some of the material (readings, movies) is kind of disturbing.","It is a good class if you are interested in varying forms of Spanish arts--paintings, poetry, prose, etc.","This class is a great opportunity to speak Spanish with other students but requires a real commitment to analyzing the material in order to succeed.","It is not too stressful, but is still intellectually stimulating.","This is a great survey course - but it can be fairly tough and annoying at times. You have to go to every lecture and sometimes writing the response papers can be not so much fun. Also, I would beware if there are more than 15 people in the class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"13","response rate":"76.92","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SPANSH 70c","course_id":"4486","cat_num":"7713","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SPANSH 70c","course_id":"4486","cat_num":"7713","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"8","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SPANSH 70c","course_id":"4486","cat_num":"7713","1s":"0","2s":"7","3s":"3","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
