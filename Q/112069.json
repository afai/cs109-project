However, this class is essential for any graduate student wishing to consider a research project during this time period.","This course covers a lot of ground, and is required for most of the students in the class.

This course has a lot of reading, but it's worth it if you put in the work and want to learn.  Definitely take this course if you are interested in learning more about the 20th century.  Something I learned at the end of the course, don't be afraid to share your opinion, even if it's not going to be popular.  At times it felt like students (including myself) were giving interpretations of the work that were \"safe.\"  But this approach limits the conversation and makes for a very one-sided perspective.  Don't be intimidated!
