TF office hour very helpful.","If you like read papers and do econ research, maybe this is the right course for you.","Ask for help as soon as you don't understand.","Few classes will introduce you to a field in as sophisticated or complete a way.","Typical Harvard worthlessness","It has all the rigor of a theory class like the 1010 series but is also much more interesting and smaller! I felt like I was doing \"real\" economics again in this class. It is tough and you will have to keep up, but I thought it was totally worth it."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["This is a great class.  Not necessarily an easy throwaway, but the material is super interesting, and Prof Mortimer is great (Although I guess she is leaving after this semester...)","This is Julie's last year teaching this class so much of the info here is useless. However, the course structure is excellent. You do quite a bit of paper reading and experimental design though, so back ground in econometrics would be a huge plus.","Really great class. It was my favorite economics I took at Harvard. Lots to understand, but not overly difficult.","Really useful class, integrates math in an easy way (also gets rid of the annoying problem in some econ classes where they try to take all the math out of it and ends up making the concepts less intuitive as a result)","Be aware that industrial organization is very micro, and consists of the organization of markets, not firms (at least at Harvard it does). It's difficult to say much more, since Prof. Mortimer won't be teaching it next year...","One of my most enjoyable economics courses.","A great chance to learn about industrial organization on an undergraduate level, while getting your hands dirty enough in the math","You learn a lot from the class and Professor Mortimer is great. However, the TFs are not very helpful, the final is hard due to the algebra and not the concepts, and the workload is not light."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"2.75","difficulty":"3.50","recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"22","response rate":"90.91","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1640","course_id":"996","cat_num":"7875","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"8","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1640","course_id":"996","cat_num":"7875","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"11","4s":"8","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1640","course_id":"996","cat_num":"7875","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"9","4s":"3","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
