Prior experience with Matlab or programming in general would be helpful and make things a bit more manageable.","It's a fun class that's not too time consuming. You learn a lot of cool material not only applicable to biology but other areas as well. The core focus of the course is a bit nebulous, but it's fun.","A great survey course in statistical and mathematical approaches to interesting biological questions. The investigations aren't impressively thorough, but they help you build a great foundation to apply these tools to useful problems.","This is one of the most rewarding courses I have taken here at Harvard.  Be warned though, this is primarily a graduate class and a lot of maturity with statistics is expected throughout.  I came in with only Math 21ab and CS50 experience and struggled a bit in the beginning because a lot of statistics is presented in the early stages (Stat 110 would have helped).  Both professors and all of the teaching fellows were very approachable and showed a willingness to help!  This course shows you how to solve inverse problems using a variety of Bayesian frameworks, Markov modeling, HMMC, SVD, and techniques related to information theory.  The course name is also a bit misleading because the techniques covered in class are applicable to almost any scientific computation, so I recommend anyone interested in the sciences to take this course!  Remember to begin psets early because they take a lot of time, and be ask the staff a lot of questions.","This class has a lot of potential, but a lot of things, like workload, are still being ironed out.  Make sure to know your TF, as he or she will be essential in problem sets"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"2.70","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"4.00","enrollment":"10","response rate":"70.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"APMTH 126","course_id":"10723","cat_num":"89788","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"APMTH 126","course_id":"10723","cat_num":"89788","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"APMTH 126","course_id":"10723","cat_num":"89788","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
