probably not a good choice for a core or extra-concentrational elective because of the level of rigor. Expect to work but be rewarded for it.","much of the class really depended on the head tf, since he wrote the problem sets and exams","If Y.T. is a TF do not take this class.","If you want to know the real economics, take 1011B.","If you actually want to learn economics and explain headlines in the WSJ, you're probably better off in 1010. I feel like I learned very little economics, but simply applied math to economics I already knew.","It is not necessarily a harder version of 1010b, since it covers a different subset of material, so it depends what you are looking for.","Although the first part of the course deals with concepts, the second half is very mathematical and this course should be considered an applied math econ course rather than just an economics course.","Take it if you have no choice.  1011b < 1010b.  Economics is entirely worthless without math.","Take this class if your other classes will not be as time consuming.  Also take this class if you have a strong ability in math and do not make many mistakes with math.","This class will teach you a lot, and it is, as Prof. Tsyvinski termed it, a \"badge of honor\".","A great opportunity to learn some simple and informative models in Economics.","This is among the most interesting of the foundational courses I have found in the Harvard Economics department.","Be prepared to work hard and work with others and you should be fine. If you don't like math, Ec1010b might be better.","Willing to work hard. Take the initiative to understand the material. However, at the end you tend to learn quite a bit.","If the professors learn from these CUE guides and replace the Head TF or show a far greater level of concern for the Head TF's work (which was entirely incogruous with lecture this year) it would be far better.)","Conditional recommendation: This course is useful IF one has a genuine interest in learning how economist model economic phenomena. In particular, the course is crucial if one is seriously considering graduate school in economics. However, if one is only seeking an understanding of economic concepts, then he is better off taking Ec1010b.","the head TF has a big impact on the class, even though the professors are good.","Good material","Be prepared to do math, algebraic manipulation and differentiation.","An interesting course that one should take if interested in Economics.","It's a great course. The lectures are amazing. They are interesting, funny and very effective. I never read the book and the lectures were enough for me to learn and understand the material. The course is about logic, no need to memorize much.","Great class to learn how real economics is done. You will learn a lot, but it  is a very disorganized and poorly taught course. Substantial self-learning is required.","Must take if want to be able to read economic papers.","Do not take this class unless you are very confident in your mathematical abilities, and enjoy learning about economic concepts via mathematical models.","not too much work and you learn a lot","Though the class is not too difficult the course material is unbearably dull.","it's tough but very worth it - it was my fav. class this term, and when i compared 1011b with 1010b at the end of the semester, i am really glad i chose this one.","I would only recommend this class if it is required for concentration and the student does not want to take 1010a.  The class was disorganized, and the professors, while generally good teachers, did not oversee the quality of the overall course well.","It's characteristic of most classes in the Economics department: large, disorganized, unfriendly, but there are interesting things to be learned.","It's definitely a solid course with good professors. Don't let horror stories of the head TF screwing up on a huge scale and being egomaniacal scare you from not taking this course.","Be careful who's your TF, go to lectures FOR SURE.","Nothing.","You don't actually learn much interesting macroeconomics. You learn how to make toy models. If you don't want to work for an investment bank or go to economics grad school, don't take this course. Take 1010b instead. It's professor, Chris Foote, is awesome.","i'm not sure it's worth the inevitable headache it will cause you.  unless you've got some past work in advanced math.","Is a challenging class, but Econ 1010b is more applicable to the real world","Great professors, be familiar with calculus","The professors are great and the material is very interesting -- and you'll be able to use the models you learn as a framework for understanding what's going on in the \"real\" world of economic policymaking.","If you love math, this is the place to be. 1010b is a joke--this is the real thing."]},"Spring '09":{"comments":["Only take if necessary for your concentration.","Class is solid across the board, problem sets are reasonable, professors are excellent, discussion of the financial crisis if very interesting","Definitely worth taking.

However, you will be rewarded with a deeper knowledge of econ than without the math.","appears to be meant more as an applied math class than an economics class","If you want to concentrate in economics, I guess you have to take this class or 1010b. I can't speak about 1010b, so this may be better. But it definitely is not good, and I would never recommend it as an elective.","This class is great! Star professors and a very timely topic.","I would advise students who are not required to take 1011, for instance applied math, to take 1010b. I think 1011a certainly has merits over 1010a, but I think in this course 1010b was much better taught and organized this term. That being said, 1010b did meet at 9am on Friday. I heard that a lot of students in my class actually used the 1010b slides to help review, so that should tell you something about the class.","Be prepared to work hard and immerse yourself in mathematical proofs and derivations.  Staying on top of financial news can only help you.  Take advantage of this chance to meet the professors.  Work with classmates on the problem sets.","pretty good class but it's sometimes not clear what the point of lessons is.","You probably won't learn anything useful or that interesting but you have to take it for Applied Math with Economics.","I would tell them to read the textbook written by Aghion, and not take the course. That was all I learned, so I don't know why I bothered going to the other lectures, in which I learned little and had no idea what I was supposed to take away from. I would also tell them that the final is much harder than anything else in the course.","Ec. 1011b is an intense, time-consuming class which rewards dedication and hard work. If you are not willing to spend the time necessary to compete with the more intense students, you will likely not enjoy the class and not do as well as you would like.","As far as I can tell, it's way better and more fun than 1010.  It bestows a good theoretical understanding of economics, and asks some interesting questions.  It's markedly easier than 1011a.","Don't take. Take 1011a which is both a legitimate subject and better taught.","The course was more structured than I expected (which is good), but being an economics course, the material was still all over the place. Also, Professor Aghion is hilarious.","It may not seem like you're learning a lot, but you really are...","A very well-thought class that teaches a lot of well-chosen and interesting material that is essential for every economist to know. The instructors' enthusiasm is definitely a great factor in making the course enjoyable.","Aghion and Laibson have completely different teaching styles, but both are very good at explaining the material. TF's write the problem sets as they see fit, which may not correspond to what is taught.","Standard macro--take it instead of 1010 if you're looking for more of a challenge with a bit more math.","This class is a difficult but rewarding class.","Obviously the structure of this class can be improved, but it is very relevant to your everyday life if you sit down and think about what you are actually doing. If you reflect and think about real terms, you will get a lot out of this class.","Very difficult. At least for me, more so than 1011a, and a little more disorganized.","A lot of math, but fulfilling.","The class is okay if you love working through general macroeconomic models but lectures tend not to relate much to the graded material."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This course is approachable and understandable within a reasonable amount of time, so if there's any place to try to approach and understand a subject, this course is the place to do it.","Homework isn't very draining, but be sure to keep up with the material.","You'll learn the nitty-gritty of economics theory.","Ec 1011b is not as mathy as Ec 1011a. Expect essay questions on the exams, which are difficult to get a high score on. If you are interested in purely mathematical economics, then take 1011a instead.","The professors are extremely good and entertaining, but this class should only be open to people who are extremely interested in learning mathematical economics.","The course is well organized and the workload isn't bad.  Be fairly comfortable with math.","Econ 1011b is essentially two different courses with two very different styles of lecturing and teaching philosophies. The TFs, however, are dedicated and intelligent and provide continuity.","This class is SIGNIFICANTLY easier than 1011a and is almost a joke. Don't come in expecting to learn everything there is to know about macroeconomics--for that, turn to Ec10 (in a very introductory, survey fashion). Rather, in 1011b, you'll spend the semester really getting to know essentially two major topics: growth and consumption, which are actually not very well touched in Ec10. I was a little disappointed by the course, especially after taking 1011a--which is a strong survey of intermediate micro theory at a rigorous pace, that this course felt overtly condescending toward one's ability and the hand-holding never ceases.","Laibson hates you.","It's a good class. Professors are amazing! While you do have to learn the math behind the models we learn, the Economics part of the class is more important. A large part of the course is a qualitative understanding, which I didn't expect.","Take this class if it suits your interests. It's a \"rigorous\" class, but not early as much as 1011a. The latter course has high expectations for its students as well as a unified curriculum. This course too often feels like a hodge-podge of economics arcana (Laibson's section).\r\n\r\nAs a macroeconomic class overall, this was a bit of a dissappointment. Aghion's material was germane, but I thought Laibson gave up too much in teaching his section. I can tell you about Tobin's q-theory, but I can't say anything about aggregate demand, unemployment, the budget, income inequality. That's a lot to give up, no?","Way better than 1011a","Philippe Aghion has a very excitable way of teaching which might be hard to understand. DON'T FALL ASLEEP in class because it only makes it harder to understand the lecture when you wake up. Also, Professor Aghion doesn't really stick to his notes, so don't just turn up for class with the notes and a pen.","I loved this class. The lectures were very interesting, the workload is not very heavy, and the material is useful, relevant, and well taught.","This is a really interesting class, loved Aghion's portion. It is tough, definitely not as hard as 1011a though. I hear the curve is going to suck though....sooo, yea, choose wisely. Although, if you're like me, you're applied math econ, so lets be real, you dont have a choice.","First part of the course is too easy and too boring. Second part is more interesting and rewarding. Managable course overall.","This course is highly quantitative. To be honest, I would probably have appreciated macroeconomics more if I had taken Ec 1010b. Here, you learn nothing about open market operations, very little about the IS-LM model, and nothing about the more basic macroeconomic paradigms. Unless if you live and breathe math, take 1010b.","It's hard work but worth it.","Aghion is great. Although his material is tough. Laibson was okay and his material was rudimentary. Stereotypical ec class.","Aghion and Laibson are fantastic lecturers (and Aghion has a wonderful accent).  The course material is highly relevant, and seamlessly incorporates your Ec10b foundations in fantastic applications to long-run growth models and short-run fluctuations of consumption and investment.  Definitely not comparable to Ec1010, take 1011 for a challenge and a great opportunity to learn from the best.","Not as challenging as 1011a, but not as interesting either. It will teach you some interesting things about economics, but it won't change the way you look at the world.","This is a GREAT class!  There is a lot more \"content\" material and significantly less math Olympics than in 1011a, which makes for a more interesting class.  Both professors are very engaging and have very unique teaching styles.  You learn a lot and go into way more legit detail than in 1010b.  Take this class if you are not satisfied with the kind of logic you used in ec 10 when you moved lines on graphs around with no basis other than a theoretical, non-mathematical framework.  You will learn a lot about how the world works and go into detail on topics that are not even touched in 1010.","You will learn important information, but make sure to fill in the macro gaps you don't learn on your own.","Be sure that you study Laibson's part of the course because it is very confusing and requires basically a lot of copying of his lecture slides in order to successfully complete it.","It's not as difficult as 1011 is hyped up to be. The teaching fellows are very helpful and walk you through the difficult material that is covered in lecture. The problem sets are also easy; while they seem very long, each subquestion walks you through the problem in baby steps so that you don't even need to think -- just do what the problem tells you to do.\r\n\r\nAghion is a great lecturer and I really enjoyed his enthusiasm. Laibson, while perhaps a bit more well-spoken than Aghion, is also good, but he hand-waves much of the material and sometimes we wonder whether he himself fully knows the answers to our questions or the math behind what he's talking about.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this course. It's a good class with a lot of interesting topics covered, and I do feel like I've gotten a lot out of it.","good teaching, interesting material, much better than 1011a, much easier","Sometimes Ec1011b might seem a bit unnecessarily math-based, but the subject matter still shines through, is interesting and pertinent, and if you like math it is not that hard and very fun!","Anyone who enrolls in Econ 1011b should have very strong reasons for doing so.  Unless you are a math concentrator or plan to pursue a career as an economist, the course is simply not worth the time investment and has a high probability of hurting your GPA.  Intimate knowledge of statistics is definitely necessary and should be a prerequisite; the cursory review of statistics provided in the lectures is not sufficient for understanding the statistics used in the course overall.","fantastic course, much more applied than 1011b","The professors are awesome and if you like economics and are a quant-y type of person you should take it!","The professors in this class are in sharp contrast to Glaesar (1011a) - it's a much warmer and slower paced class. However, don't expect to learn as much.","it's a good solid macro course with professors who care","It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significantly less quantitative than Economics 1011a.","For someone who doesn't have aspirations for economics graduate school and is more interested in obtaining an intermediate macroeconomic foundation, 1010b may be a better course. 1011b is a nice course that is sufficiently challenging with good lectures and TFs, but I felt as though I didn't learn as much as I could have.","This class is really good and is not nearly as intense or scary as 1011a. Laibson's half of the course was particularly good and he is very personable and tries to get to know the students. The workload is really manageable but make sure you stay on top of everything because the two tests are basically all of your grade.","Hard but interesting and fun."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["If you are good at math, take this class. If you like an intuitive and topical understanding of macro, take 1010b. Not having to wake up at 9am MWF is worth taking a harder class.","You won't cover as many concepts as Ec1010b, so in terms of developing intuition, this class is not helpful.  however, it's taught well, Aghion is delightful, and Laibson is well organized.","Take this course if you're looking for a mathematically rigorous economics class.  However, I don't think you learn that much more economics; it's just more mathy.","This is a very good class.  But if you're in Tom Cunningham's section, it becomes a great class.","This course is nothing like Ec 1011a.  It's definitely easier but it's also just different in every way.  It consists of two basically unrelated courses: growth theory (taught by Aghion) and stochastic processes, asset pricing, intertemporal choice, habit formation, investment models, etc. (taught by Laibson).  You won't really learn a lot about macroeconomics but most of the material is interesting.  The lectures are pretty good but the sections are pretty bad.  If you're looking for a more challenging version of Ec 1010b, definitely go for it.","Take this course if you're interested in the models behind economics - aka if you like econometrics.","Very intelligent professors, from whom you get to hear a lot about their own work. Much of this class is translating mathematical symbols into intuitive phenomena.","This class is hard, especially if you didn't take 1011a, but you learn a lot.","much easier than 1011a","It's a great class, but be prepared to get slammed by the midterm.","The class was mildly interesting but could have been better in presenting macroeconomic materials, such as by providing case study lectures of real economic problems beyond the subprime housing crisis.","Ec1011a is a great class that teaches a very mathematical approach to macroeconomic concepts. Both professors are very different, but great teachers that care about the entire class understanding the material. Sections are also very helpful. I would recommend going to as many lectures as possible, even though the lecture notes are available online.","I'm sure you'll read\/hear about how the course lacks a coherent structure. That's true and I do hope it gets improved, but I highly recommend that you take this course if you really want to learn about economics. Professor Aghion and Laibson are incredibly kind and patient. Aghion lost sleep because we didn't get the Schumpetarian model initially while Laibson constantly inspired us to make an impact. To a certain extent, the structure of this course (or lack of in some parts) reflects the messiness of macroeconomics but these two professors tried their best to present the students with the leading economics models and theories, and I did learn a lot. If you did not have the best time in Ec1011a and worry about reliving a nightmare, fear not, this class is not that crazy. You actually have time to absorb the materials before moving on to the next topic (yeah, you will see the smile on people's faces after the first class) because it is taught in a much better pace. Actually, having completed the 1011 series, I think Ec1011b should be taken before Ec1011a. Seriously.","A well-organized course with very interesting material and great profs. Less demanding and time-consuming than 1011a","Not as well organized as 1011a.","The first have of the course is obnoxious but it gets much better in the second half when taking about consumption.","I mean the course isn't that hard and you won't have to do a lot of work (especially if you took 1011a which is an amazing course and you should take it!) but you really won't learn that much...pretty much its just memorizing the models and working with infinite geometric series...thats about it....","Best decision I've made at Harvard so far as an aspiring economist.","If lectures are somewhat confusing or disorganized, the books often cover the same material but in a more organized stream of logic.","DO NOT be fooled by the first few lectures - the class in the second half (taught by laibson) becomes more mathy. Take it if you want to get a taste of grad school economics; but it probably won't help your GPA.","This class is really awesome.  I took it instead of Ec 10 and found I learned loads - it really turned me on to economics.  You get to learn some really cool models and conceptualize important aspects of the economy like consumption, investment, and long-run economic growth.","It is a difficult class, but the material is interesting. I think that the next year, the T.F's will solidify their teaching style, and perhaps that will greatly enhance the class.","It's a little challenging, but you learn a lot. And the math is not at all crazy. Plus the professors are great!","Much less volume of work and struggle than 1011a. Develops some good foundations, but is a bit slow getting there for a 1011 series course.","I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class this year.  I was one of the few students in the class without a strong math background, and the majority of students in the class are app math, math, physics, or econ with strong math preparation.  That being said, I still felt that I left the class having learned a lot about math and econ and about applying math to economic situations.  I did feel that I spent a lot of time learning things that were more intuitive to the rest of my peers and consequently, there was some material that I never fully mastered.  I did find this course very difficult, but manageable even with my weak math background.  It is definitely not a large time commitment to get the assignments done although time is needed to excel.  I would definitely take this class again.  The teaching staff is amazing!","You won't learn any macro, or anything useful...","It's a required course... but the amazing professors more than make up for it.","Great course to take!","Although the material seems somewhat disjointed and it's difficult to explain what the course is about, you'll probably learn something and it's not quite as challenging as 1011a was.","It is challenging but rewarding.  A great alternative to wasting away in 1010b.","Both professors are great!","This is  a really cool, interesting class. The math is not actually difficult in this class if you've taken 21a or above. If you took stuff above 21, the math is actually really easy, but this is good, cause the math should assist the understanding of the economics, not obscure it. Aghion and Laibson are awesome, and it's an honor to have them in lecture. Midterm was really hard, and I got totally boned, though I still think this class is really good.","You must study.","Interesting and not nearly as challenging mathematically as 1011a.","It's not hard, but unless there are better TFs, this class is really not worth it. The class is disorganized and low on the faculty's priority list.","Prepare for intense frustration. This class makes me hate economics, not because it's hard, but because I've realized how arbitrary the field is.","This is a pretty good course. In lecture it seems much, much easier than 1011a, but beware for problem sets and exams: it isn't as easy as you have convinced yourself it is. And apparently the curve is harsh, so it's actually tougher to get an A-\/A in this class than in 1011a.","This class embodies everything that is wrong with the ec department: large, impersonal, disorganized, low-quality in every respect. TFs who can't teach and don't care, professors who don't hold office hours, poorly written problem sets, course material with only the pretense of mathematical rigor.","Ec 1011b gave me a firm grounding in the theories of macroeconomics. It was not easy, but it was interesting material and I learned a lot.","Much more manageable class than Ec1011a. Though it's still difficult, it is not as intimidating and both Laibson and Aghion are very open to answering questions and explaining confusing information in more detail.","Super interesting material, way better than 1011a. Laibson makes material very accesible, and Laibson is fun. Watch out for midterm and final, they are practically the only two grades so make sure you stay on top of material for the tests.","This course is going to be really hard but not impossible. The experience is going to be amazing as long as you come to class prepared. Also always think first before you raise your hand and ask a question - there really are stupid questions. Some might complain about how the lectures (esp. the first half) were hard to follow but I didn't find that to be the case","Make sure you know what you're getting into","It is a very rewarding course. The problem sets and exams are difficult- the problem sets can take time and preparing for the exam will also take a lot of time but it is really worth it.If you plan on concentrating in economics, I think this course is a must-take because you really learn what macroeconomics is about through the math, derivations, and models. Basically, don't get scared and take 1010b- take 1011b.","Do it if you need to, or want to be an economist.  If you want to learn about econ in general, take 1010b","Much easier than Ec1011a, but also less interesting and less relevant (not that Ec1011a was relevant anyway). Aghion's lecture style is really not effective but he really cares about his students. Laibson's lectures were much more interesting, but the math didn't seem very useful although it was pretty simple and straightforward","If you want to study macroeconomics and actually understand theoratical background, take this course.","This class presents a lot of interesting macroeconomic concepts (growth, consumption, investment etc). Expect about the same level of math, although presented more slowly\/gradually than Ec1011a. The instructors are both wonderful!","Actually not as hard as it is rumored to be. Workload isn't that bad either. But if economics is something you truly enjoy, take it. If not, it'll be a torture.","The professors are really nice, and the material feels applicable. None of the readings are actually required, and since they post good lecture slides it's easy to study.","This is a very good class, much easier than 1011a and overall far more enjoyable. Aside from a very tricky midterm, material was difficult but accessible (read: you can do the problem sets by yourself). The first half of the course is easier than the second, but neither is too tough. Very well taught by enthusiastic professors who like to engage in discussion with students. Take advantage of that fact to ask for clarification, etc. Be warned that some knowledge of probability theory (having taken Stat110, for example) is definitely useful though not compulsory - it will make your life easier for sure. If you are deciding between 1010b and 1011b, don't be too scared of this course. The math is not too daunting and much of the material is more interesting and engaging.","Much like with 1011a, this class will probably be your hardest course this semester. The models are a little fuzzier and the conclusions a little more vague, but this is still a seriously mathematical course.","The second half of the semester is much more interesting and challenging than the first half.  Beware the midterm was much more difficult than most expected.","ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY YOUR INTERMEDIATE ECONOMICS EXPERIENCE!\r\n\r\nI enormously enjoyed Economics 1011b: Intermediate Macroeconomics with Philipe Aghion and David Laibson. The entire teaching staff (the TFs were so dedicated and ALWAYS reachable\/approachable and made GREAT lecture outlines) was phenomenal and made the already well structured and interesting course even better. Applications to the real world were also emphasized. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about the math, seriously!","Horribly organized, almost no content","Good class, easier than 1011a, TFs are nice, professors are fantastic. Material can get a bit dry, but it's good. Only complaint from this year was that sections were at absurd time (e.g. 9am) but otherwise, good class.","Great class, manageable workload, with brilliant professors who really care a lot about making sure you understand the material.","It was an enjoyable class, not too hard. Aghion is awesome! The topics covered by Laibson are interesting. I took it without taking taking intermediate micro and I was fine.","Both professors are really great lecturers, and they speak about completely different subjects (long-run and short-run). The Long-run section is a little less quantitative, and is great for people coming from a strong ec background, but the short-run stuff is really interesting from a stat\/math perspective"]},"Spring '12":{"comments":["If you have to take it, you have to take it. Ec 1011a was a far better class, so don't get your hopes up. 1011b was ok - 4 group psets, a project, and 2 exams. The curve is awful though, and for us the median of the midterm was an 87. So the only people who will get As are probably the ones who got like 98s on their midterms and finals. The class is really annoying and terrible.","The material is difficult and the lack of structure makes it even more so; find a solid problem set group, go to office hours early, and read the lecture notes. This class does not provide you with much practice material to work with, so when it comes to the midterm and final, you'll be on your own","Interesting material but not well organized class. You'll learn a lot if you pay attention in class, go to office hours, and do the readings, but you sometimes wonder where it's all going.","This is a great course, but know that it is quite challenging as well. It was definitely an improvement on 1011a (more manageable math in lecture, group work on psets and project, more reasonable exams, etc), but it is still a difficult course.","this class was very unorganized (it was the first year with these professors). section was completely, entirely useless. take it if you want to learn a couple of macro models that explain GDP growth because you don't really do much else the whole time.","A good course with lots of interesting material but a few structural issues (not enough PSets to fully learn all the material for example) keep it from being great. Its easier than 1011a, but the people are largely the same which means its difficult to improve from how you did relative to that class, especially since the professors rather ominously speak out against grade inflation.","Next year, this class will be taught buy different professors, so take this with a grain of salt. Overall, the course was somewhat interesting but not all that exciting. The first half of the course deals with short-run fluctuations. Unfortunately, we were either using the IS-LM model, which seemed too simplified, or dealing with a flood of unilluminating accounting equations. The second half of the course deals with long run growth models which seem to test credulity.","It's very different from Ec 10 and 1011a, but still a good class in its own right.","Take it if econ is a part of your required classes.","This is a pretty good class but my impression is that it changes heavily year to year depending on the professors. In choosing to take the class, take a look at who is teaching. You may be better off looking at Q scores from previous years. The material is interesting and the lectures are excellent, but it can be disorganized at times. There is a lack of unity between section, class, problems, and the exams.","Difficult, but worthwhile.  Hugely important for any economics student","The course is very organized, when you start it start it with a structure and discipline.  Do the readings and all office hours.  You have to be very independent to succeed so maybe wait until Sophmore year.","Sebnem is an incredible professor but Elias is rather rude and condescending. The first portion of the class is far more interesting than the section portion. The problem sets can take a while, but you have two weeks to do them and they are done in a group, so they end up not being that bad. The midterm and final are difficult and the project takes a good amount of effort and time. Try to keep up with the material (review lecture notes at the end of each week and make sure you understand everything that is going on) but don't bother with the textbook or journal article readings (unnecessary to do well in the course and not worth your time). Tim is a horrible section leader and very poor at answering questions, but Yang is absolutely wonderful. Go to his section\/office hours, and don't be afraid to ask to meet with him outside of that as well - he is very accommodating and sincerely wants you to do well in the course.","This course gives you a phenomenal introduction to real macroeconomics. This course dives directly into current macroceconomic research issues and the fundamental macroeconomic models. The math component of the course really makes learning macroeconomics much more rigorous and ultimately rewarding. This course gave me a much better understanding of macroeconomics, and I have learned a lot. Definitely recommend over 1010b, especially for econ concentrators. As a requirement for AM\/Ec concentrators, this course is a great one.","The course has very interesting material but was taught very poorly this year.","This may well be a worthwhile class when taught by Laibson and Aghion; this year's offering, however, was pitiful. Literally 75% of the pre-midterm class time was spent re-deriving results that we had been expected to formulate independently in one of the three 1011a modeling projects. Post-midterm, we were able to study two differential equations and also mumble a little bit about regressions. Basically, the pace is unacceptably slow. The instructors also felt it necessary to continually declare that the course would be graded on a steep curve. Come exam time, however, they handed answers away like candy? Sebnem literally answered two of the midterm questions on the board. Elias extended the final by half an hour for no reason. Problem sets were absurdly collaborative. If the stated goal is to generate variation in grades, this isn't the way to do it. In sum: this class was an insult to most of its students' intelligence (though most of the smart ones did wisely drop it during the first two weeks).","The course provides an interesting perspective on macroeconomic modeling, although it currently lacks the organization and focus necessary to recommend it highly.","It's a tough course that takes up a lot of time, and the evaluations aren't particularly fair. But you do cover a lot of cool material. Definitely learned a lot, but the experience could have been a little smoother if it was more organized.","This could have and should have been an excellent course. I would take Ec 1010b just to avoid it.","This class has the potential to teach you a lot but you have to pay attention in lecture\/section and possibly do the (many) readings--without doing this, you will learn things, but some of the concepts might still be sort of hazy in your head. I would recommend making every effort to make it to class.","Elias and Sebnem are both fun and interesting teachers. The math requirement was much lower than I expected, and the course drew on intuition more than derivatives and other mathematical concepts.","There is little support for this class in terms of administration and organization. As a section TF, Yang is very helpful, but other than office hours, there is no venue to seek help if one is struggling. The later lectures on growth regressions and real-world data are also not quite as well organized as the ones in the first half of the course, and there is a distinct disparity between practice problems and the problems on the final exam. Be prepared to be unpleasantly surprised by problems on the final exam (assuming a similar final to this year's).","Class is somewhat disorganized, although learning the models is encouraged and really the models are instrumental in learning intermediate-theory macro.","It is a good course but be prepared to be challenged and frequently confused with some of the concepts. Ec1011a is not a required prerequisite but is very helpful.","The material is very interesting and Sebnem and Elias deliver amazing lectures. Sections need some serious improvements though.","1011b is an absolute must for anyone really interested in economics and possibly interested in pursuing the subject in grad school. You need to be willing to work hard but the rewards are well worth the effort. The 1011 series shows you what economics as a science is all about.","If you like Macroeconomics and you don't mind working in groups then this class is right for you. Lectures cover some more advanced material, but they are often a bit boring. All problem sets and the final project are done in groups, which can be a good thing if you find a good group. I, personally, did not enjoy this class, but I was also not very interested in the material, and did not join a very committed group.","The material of this class is interesting and the workload is not too bad, but the organization of the class (especially sections and exams) will really frustrate you.","While this course offers more econ focus than 1011a, it still suffers from an excessive focus on mathematic modeling. Would have taken the 1010 series for a more thorough economics understanding, if this course wasn't required for App Math-Ec","It's a great class, but know what you're getting yourself into. Not as difficult as 1011a but probably more time-consuming. The final project is very rewarding.","Not as hard as 1011a, but that doesn't mean you can slack off.","This class was very difficult. Be very prepared to work hard, and still be overwhelmed for the final. Be prepared to make this class your priority, and have the mental preparation to take a hit on your GPA. On the other hand, the course was taught well - Sebnem and Elias were great, and it went much deeper than what my friends in 1010b were doing.","Do not take this course unless taught by Aghion."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["Whether you're going to be doing economics, applied math, or any other subject, this course is a great way to get a taste of how economics can actually be applied to the real world.  You'll learn the basic models defining growth, and understand how economists evaluate the many mechanisms of our economy as a whole.  Also, Laibson is the man, his viewpoint and insight on many of the topics are exactly the reason a Harvard education is so valuable.","DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOKS. I wasted $200 for books we hardly ever used. Also, Aghion's half of the class is much better than Laibson's. Psets are also deceptively easy.","Unless the course is made more rigorous with more math, it is a fairly boring class. Generally most of the intermediate macro material is covered, but in a fairly elementary way.","This class or a similar macroeconomic class is essential for students looking to understand the state of macroeconomic development in the world. The professors are very upfront with the emerging nature of the field, but getting your feet wet is the best way to try it for yourself. Although I found the developmental economics half more interesting, both halves were very well taught, and the assignments and examinations were very fair. The class is less mathematical than in previous years, which seems to rob the class of deeper technical insights, but I suppose that opens to a wider audience. Go to lectures. Ask questions. Make sure that everything actually makes sense. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to get by in the class without doing so, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really robbing yourself of the experience. The class wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too difficult, only requiring multivariable calculus to the extent of being able to take first order conditions.I thoroughly enjoyed Ec1011b!","The class is much improved from previous years and the material on the psets and tests are much more doable. That said, there is still a lot of obscure math in econ that you'll have to struggle to understand, especially in Aghion's lectures. Go to Yao's office hours and ask lots of questions!","You have to treat this as a math class rather than economics class. To do well, you must have a very strong math background because you will rely more on your math ability rather than critical thinking to do well in the class at the end of the class.","Take this class over Ec1010b. You won't regret it, especially b\/c the professors are moving away from math. You get to learn from amazing faculty, too!","Can go a bit slow if you've done 1011a. Professor Aghion's part is very interesting conceptually and Professor Laibson does a lot of interesting behavioural stuff.","It's a lot easier than Econ 1011a, so if you took that and are hesitant about going through a similar experience, don't worry.  The material is interesting to learn and practice.  Go to lecture because that's where most of the learning happens.","It's such important stuff! You should take it.","The only reason to take this class (aside from if you are an Applied Math-Ec concentrator), is that Philippe Aghion is the most adorable man on the planet. And that David Laibson is quite possibly the most inspirational professor, ever. As perplexed as you may feel about how the course fits together (you have two very different parts, and the subsections of David's part feel discrete), the professors make you feel like you are doing something worthwhile. Philippe's part takes you through a series of growth models, and he dispels all of them until you get to what he definitely believes is the beacon of macroeconomics, his Schumpeterian model. I wish I could explain to you what it was, but he seemed to think it was quite important. David's part is also about his debunking most common conceptions; he will get you excited about behavioral economics! Last comment: BUY THE BOOKS. They are essential to doing well in the class. Don't buy them new, though; get them used from former students!!","This course has definitely been made lighter than it was in the past (as studying prior years' finals\/midterms made clear), and by \"lighter\" I mean requiring less math. That may seem like a plus, and certainly the work burden is not too significant (if you've been discouraged by 1011a, don't worry, this is nothing like it). But at the same time, it felt like I wasn't getting the rigorous approach to the subject I'd hoped for; a times, it amounted to a glorified Ec 10. It's not a bad course, and you learn some interesting things. But it could be better.","This course was significantly less mathematical\/rigorous than it has been in previous years and suffered as a result. There was very little difference from Ec10b in terms of the material and in fact the problem sets may have been easier.","If you are deciding between 1011 and 1010, take 1011.","Since I did not take 1011a, I struggled a little bit in the beginning but thanks to my awesome study group and TF's, I was able to keep up. I learned a lot in this course about growth models, financial crisis, and consumption behavior! Aghion and Laibson are both fantastic professors and the TF's are all really nice and super helpful.","I enjoyed the material in this class. The class was somewhat disorganized. Psets were not very well written. But overall, I still have to say I enjoyed the class, because I found the material to be ver interesting.","Fantastic course! Less demanding than 1011a and you learn a lot. Also smaller course, more fairly tested, and not at 9am -- all unlike 1010b!!","Take the course if you want a decent macroeconomic introduction. It's good, nothing exceptional (don't think you'll be gripping your seat or running to lecture in excitement) but it covers what needs to be covered in a non-boring way, which is commendable. If you're coming from 1011a, feel free to sleep through the math.","I LOVED this course. It really helped me gain a lot of economic intuition and didn't get bogged down in unnecessary math. Both professors were wonderful.","Mixed feelings about this class. I took 1011b, with just AP Econ background from high school way back when, because I'm interested in international development, and preferred taking the more quantitative\/math-y class (vs. 1010b). In content, for me, the first half on overall growth of economies was quite interesting (perhaps not that rigorously modeled, but cool to see how factors like education, healthcare, institutions\/government, etc. play a role in growth), and the second half was okay but then turned more finance-y. This course also really isn't allll that math-y, and the parts that are aren't really gone over that well and in the end you just need to know the simpler results from perhaps more complicated calculations.","Much easier than 1011a, not the same rigor. But still an interesting topic. The models we learn are pretty crude, though, which makes you realize how much further we have to go in the field of economics.","Beware if you took 1011a and loved it or at least respected it; this class is nothing like that.  What drew me to 1011a was the math and how Professor Glaeser really utilized it to explain microeconomic theories.  I've even heard 1011a described as a math class with economics applications.  1011b is nothing like 1011a.  It's a lot more wishy-washy and seemed to have a gen-ed feel to it at the end.  Didn't we want to take this course to get a more mathematical approach to macroeconomics?  Instead, I feel like the class is \"dumbed down\" a lot, for reasons unclear to me.  Psets took 30 minutes-1 hour, while 1011a psets took 10-15 hours.  I think this was because of the TF's, who weren't all too great this year.  The structure of the course is also a bit strange.  Professor Aghion does the first half on long run theory while Professor Laibson does the second half on short run theory.  There wasn't much overlap at all, which I think would have been helpful in tying the course together.  Exams weren't too bad.  If you come from 1010a, you'll probably find this course a bit more challenging than 1010a.  If you come from 1011a, you'll find this course to be a letdown in how unchallenging it is.","It's a good class. Laibson's a great lecturer and the material is pretty interesting. The only thing is that the course isn't the most organised and the problem sets aren't very interesting.","The economics taught is fairly interesting, but for those expecting the class to be at the same level mathematically as 1011a, the pace of the course might seem a bit disappointing.","Very good foundation in macroeconomics for future Ec concentrators - take it.","You learn some good stuff. The exam was really hard. I wouldn't take it if it weren't required because there's a lot of repeat with 1011a and with ec 10 and lecture is pretty boring. Section is helpful, office hours are super helpful, and the psets are fun, though.","This class is tough, do not underestimate it. Learn the basic processes throughly for exams.","This class has a highly conceptual focus - it is very different to Ec1011a. I enjoyed this course because the course load was extremely fair and the psets were never bogged down in mathematical minutiae. Be prepared to write essays on economic concepts\/events as well as manipulate simple mathematical models. Focus on the concepts and intuition - not the mathematics!","I loved the structure of this course -- Aghion lecturing on growth economics and Laibson on fluctuations and asset markets -- it gave an excellent overview of macro topics. However, I actually thought the class was slightly \"dumbed down\" from previous years. I would have preferred for it to have been more mathematical. After all, that is why Ec1011b is offered. It is definitely easier than Ec1011a. Nevertheless, Aghion and Laibson make an incredible team, and I highly recommend the course over Ec1010b.","This class is much, much easier than 1011a. The algebra was simple and there were very few derivatives. I could even do the problem sets without help. The workload was much lighter. However, I also think 1011a is a better class. This class seems to lack an identity because they took away some of the math - it felt more like Ec 10 than like Ec 1011a at times. Laibson's part of the course is more interesting and his lectures are clearer than Aghion's, but it looks like he won't teach the course next year.","If you have to take a macroeconomics course here, this is the best, I think. That being said, it was not the best run class--the TFs were pretty unhelpful and not everything is covered in class. However, the professors are both very nice and very talented individuals, if not spectacular teachers.","I think this class is definitely worth taking - the exams are hard but the class gave me a much clearer and deeper understanding of the financial crisis of 2008.","Not a lot of work but moderately difficult. There are smart people in the class so there isnt much of  a curve on tests. Some of the material is interesting and Laibson is great!","Professors Aghion and Laibson are PHENOMENAL - they'll definitely be two of the best professors you'll ever have. In addition to their great teaching and how much they care about their students (Aghion is incredibly kind, and Laibson makes a genuine effort to learn as many names as possible), the TF's are all very accessible and helpful, the material is interesting and presented well, and the problem sets and exams are very reasonable. All in all a very solid course; not at all like 1011a, and one of my favorite classes here so far.","Take it seriously.","take this class only if you absolutely need it for the concentration requirement. otherwise, i think 1010b would be a better experience. that said, laibson is the man.","It's a great class!","This class is way easier than Ec 1011a, but also more boring than 1011a and less organized.","A great survey of key macroeconomic principles with a mathematical approach.","Ec 1011b is a great course, and the lectures are all very interesting. It was difficult for me (I took the first semester of Ec 10 and AP Macro in high school) but if I had put more time into the course, doing all of the readings, it probably would have been a tad bit easier. That said, if you're going into the course like me, with not the full background that people usually have, be prepared to be a little frightened come midterm and final time, and be willing to work really hard! It's definitely doable, however, and if you are interested in economics, it's definitely a great class to take.","Very gentle introduction to real economics (research\/mathematical models). Optimally, take this before Ec 1011a or as early as possible.","The class is the easiest class I took since sophomore year in high school. The instructors have intentionally \"dumbed down\" the course. If you haven't taken econ, this might be a good course. Otherwise, it is not worth the time. Unless the philosophy of treating students as idiots is revised, there is little point in taking the course.","This class should be taken by those only seriously considering higher study of economics with a good understanding of calculus"]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Go to section!","It wasn't as mathy as I expected, but putting it next to the alternative (1010b), it's probably preferable. \r\nHowever, be aware that the second instructor this year (Willen) did not provide much of a rigorous mathematical explanation of macroeconomics.","For a more mathematical version of Econ 1010b, it did not have a lot of math in it.","It is what you make of it. Read the book.","This course is often difficult and could be much better if readings were more streamlined and lined up better with lecture. Professor Willen's discussion of the financial crisis was quite interesting.","It is not to much time- if you are applied math-ec, its not the most exciting class, but also not the worst.","The class was interesting, though not as rigorous as ec1011a.","This class is not nearly as difficult as Ec 1011a with Prof. Glaeser in any conceivable way. The models are fairly simple and don't require a lot of math to understand. You can probably take this after Math 1b or so; Math 21a is overkill, and we never used any serious multivariate skills. The material is covered at a reasonably slow pace, for the most part. The problem sets are not a piece of cake, but they are not very time-consuming or too mentally taxing, and doing them the night before they were due was feasible. Unfortunately, the relative ease of this class arises from a lack of rigor relative to 1011a. The macroeconomic models here are terrible at explaining real economic trends, although they are elegant in some respects.\r\n\r\nThe class was generally well-taught. Prof. Aghion is entertaining, funny, and generally good at explaining things. He made sure to go slowly (sometimes too slowly) when necessary. Prof. Paul Willen was visiting from the Fed, so I suppose he won't be around again for a while at least; but I thought he also did a reasonably good job. He was very cynical and entertaining, and he was good at explaining concepts, although his half of the course could have been more quantitative.","If you've taken Math 21a already and are an Econ concentrator, I would recommend taking this over 1010b. It meets at a better time, and the professors did a really good job, and while it was difficult I never thought I was in crazy over my head, it ends up less work overall too because we have less problem sets to do in 1011b","The first half of the class (Aghion) was about long-run growth and was quite good, especially when he covered his own model! Only at Harvard does the professor use his own textbook and teach you the model he developed that is now accepted as mainstream. It was cool and his lectures were engaging. Dr. Willen generated less enthusiasm but tried quite hard to make the material applicable to the financial crisis. He is quite good at explaining things in simple terms, although I would have liked to see a more rigorous treatment of the issues - I felt like I just relearned Ec 10 with cooler subtleties about the crisis. Hopefully the TFs next year are different because they were awful. No one went to section because it was useless and they didn't know anything that was going on.","Pales in comparison to 1011a as the instructors decided to repeat Ec-10 and strip the course of any math it seemed, but still a solid course","The two halves of this class are completely different.  Aghion's part is very difficult and hard to follow and Willen's is very easy and I don't feel I learned very much.  Overall the class was very badly taught, the material was not covered in an equitable way.  This class is a requirement for Applied Math and Ec as well as the Quantitative Finance Track for Stat, but if you are thinking just about Ec I would take 1010b that students seem to actually enjoy.","Take this over 1010b. It's not too difficult, but you get a more math-based foundation. It's way easier than 1011a, so don't let fall semester scare you off. It was a very straightforward class, and you'll get something out of it. Go to section! They go over problems that are almost identical to the graded problem sets.","This class is super boring, and super badly organized.  I hope they overhaul it.  Willen was excellent though!","Paul Willen is a funny guy during the second half of the semester, but you'll do most of your modeling and learning with Philip. Can't say I learned much with Paul. I stopped going to lecture. This class is a lot easier than Ec1011a.","The material is well-presented but very dry.  Do not take this course as an elective.","It is a bit of a joke after 1011a, and a much less intellectually stimulating course. I was a bit let down by how little I learned.","Only take it if you have to and get ready for the worst!!!","The material discussed in this class is very interesting, but the infrastructure is horrible. One person teaches the class, another person grades psets, and yet another two people grade exams. No one seems to really care about the students, and office hours are often conveniently scheduled right after problem sets are due and way before exams so that when people actually need help there is no one to get it from. That said, Professor Willen was very good about his office hours for the second half of the course and Carlos (one of the TFs) was quick at responding to questions over email. The midterm exam is worth 40% of the grade, which I think is exorbitant. The problem sets themselves are fine, except for the plethora of spelling and grammatical mistakes that seems to permeate every facet of this course. Overall, however, the material is good and the professors are both good teachers, so I'd recommend taking the class. The math is reasonable and actually often lends clarity to the more difficult concepts.","It's a little boring after Econ 1011a, but still much better than 1010b.","Nothing like 1011a; this course is far less interesting and engaging.","I would recommend taking this class if you , if only because the alternative is 1010b. Be prepared to take 2 separate and unrelated classes, the difficulty of which will depend heavily on which professors are teaching it.","necessary for an ec concentration, not the most challenging\/rewarding class. lectures were sometimes dull\/problem sets were dull. I think the material could be taught in a much more effective manner.","The course gives a pretty good intro to Macro, but there was little to no communication (or so it seemed) between professors.","It's a great class. The second half is very nice about building economic intuition, while the first half feels like an easy extension of Ec1011a to macroeconomics. Second half is a bit harder because it is less mathematical and you need to be more attuned to economic insights. However, the professor made the final exam short, so there was no time pressure - I really liked that. This is also a good class to take as say, a fifth class because it doesn't take up too much time.","Take it because you need to. I found it quite simple after Econ 1011a.","This is a refreshing follow-up to Economics 1011a. You will learn useful material at a more leisurely pace.","The first half of the course is much more challenging than the second part. Try working hard on all the psets. The solutions given on iSites by the TFs are not very well-written.","Make sure you can follow the math  and make sure you teach yourself the economics behind things","Much, much easier than 1011a. Aghion, who teaches the first half, is very lively and passionate about his subject (which is long-run growth.) So I very much enjoyed the first half of the class. Paul Willen took over to teach the second part, on short-run fluctuations. I would say that the second part of the class was really not challenging enough. It was very easy, and the concepts taught very basic. The problems sets were challenging in the first half, and very undemanding in the second one. I understand that the second part of the class was taught with some more rigor by David Laibson. However, this may simply have been a result of the fact that Paul Willen was teaching Ec 1011b for the first time this year, and thus did not quite know how to calibrate the class.","Take 1010b.","If you have to take this course for applied math\/econ it is not that bad. I'm not sure if I would have taken it if it wasn't required. So much easier than 1011a, but the midterm and final are weighted so heavily it can be challenging to do well. Also, so much less inspiring\/interesting than 1011a.","The theoretical ideas explored in the first half of the course (taught by Professor Aghion) were very interesting. The problem sets were not fulfilling or intellectually stimulating enough. I also believe the course did not cover enough macroeconomic concepts to be considered a proper, somewhat \"comprehensive\" macroeconomics course.","The fact that the course is taught by two different professors makes it really hard to find the connection between the first half and the second half of the course. Although the final was not cumulative, I would have liked to see better flow from one topic to the next rather than a disjointed conglomeration of material.","The organization of this class was a mess. I actually think that this year 1010b might have been more difficult. With two professors, one that takes over for the other after the midterm, 1011b was basically two classes. The material was pretty disjointed and the final wasn't cumulative. Still, if you want to do Econ stuff, you don't have many better options here.","If you've taken Ec 1011a, this is the easiest class you can take at Harvard.","Go to every section.","Take it if you have to (AM\/EC people), but otherwise take a more interesting course. First half of the course in my opinion was frustrating, second half was better. Not nearly as quantitative as EC1011a, but more so than EC1010b, which I heard was a joke.","Philippe is a great lecturer, but be prepared for fast (and sometimes careless) math derivations, which may not make sense at first glance. Overall, the course is a good extension of Intro Econ."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.10","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"3.10","enrollment":"80","response rate":"76.25","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1011b","course_id":"957","cat_num":"6993","1s":"3","2s":"10","3s":"30","4s":"13","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1011b","course_id":"957","cat_num":"6993","1s":"3","2s":"12","3s":"28","4s":"14","5s":"4"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1011b","course_id":"957","cat_num":"6993","1s":"9","2s":"37","3s":"11","4s":"3","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
