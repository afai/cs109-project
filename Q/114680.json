The challenge primarily comes not from the instructors, who will urge you on in a constructive and familiar fashion, but from yourself, as you struggle to exceed your own expectations of what you can accomplish. It is a tremendously valuable course, but not for the faint of heart.","It is a significant amount of work because of the video and reading components. It's not a class you should take during a busy term.","it is a lot of work but rewarding if you are interested and willing to put in the time"]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is by far the best class that I have taken at Harvard. The course format, assignments, professors, and teaching fellow provided an unrivaled education experience. As a senior about to graduate, this is one of very few courses from which I have gained such valuable skills that I will surely apply to my future education and career. Despite the time commitment, I would retake this course every semester if I could.","As long as you are willing to take on the heavy workload, this class is one of the best I have ever taken.  The dynamic of having two professors is very productive, the reading materials are interesting and chosen so that they resonate with one another, and the combination of seminar and video practicum necessitates that one approach the same subject using two different methodologies.  Peter Galison and Rob Moss have an extraordinary grasp of the academic and filmmaking issues at hand, and one is compelled to probe those areas where these practices can become intertwined.  I don't know about other TA's, but George Olken made himself really available outside of class and gave instructions on filming and FCP that could be readily understood by beginners.","Take this class if you have the time! Be prepared to give at *least* 10 hours per week, but it's completely, utterly worth it. You'll learn a ton about film and start to see the social and material in scientific practice. Also, Robb and Peter give intelligent feedback to your work, which is invaluable. This may be the best class I've ever taken.","it is a time-consuming class no doubt, between classes, filming, editing, and reading, but it is so so worth it! one of my favorite classes i have taken at harvard ever!","Approach science critically, via words each week and through your and your fellow students cameras overall -- what you put in you take out. Take it.","Be prepared to work hard!"]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"5.00","workload":"4.00","difficulty":"3.86","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"100.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 152","course_id":"2660","cat_num":"8254","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 152","course_id":"2660","cat_num":"8254","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 152","course_id":"2660","cat_num":"8254","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"2"}},"success":true}
