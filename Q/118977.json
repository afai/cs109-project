It's difficult but so rewarding. Despite the stress, I actually enjoy researching and writing.","Professor Phillips provides helpful information and guidelines in getting the first chapter done, but no amount of advice from him or your thesis adviser means anything if you yourself don't do the research and planning\/analyzing. If possible, try to have a vague idea of your topic before starting the semester and do some research and reading before class since its almost impossible to get any background research done once classes start.  But they tell us that this first chapter is the hardest part so its all downhill (or uphill? who really knows...) from here! Also, make sure you have a thesis adviser who you can talk to and provides helpful feedback. They can really make sense of blathering paragraphs or muddled topics.","You learn so much about yourself and your likes, strengths and weaknesses. It's tough to push yourself and stick to your goals. I love owning a project. And it's got me thinking about a PhD.","By doing individual research you are actually contributing to the existing knowledge base in the history of science field- a difficult, but truly respectable accomplishment with which to finish your academic career.","Writing a thesis is tough. Be committed and truly interested in your topic or it will be hell. I can assume it will be worth it in the end if I make it.","I mean, for a thesis tutorial its not half bad.","it is a lot of work to write a thesis. make sure you are committed to writing a lot over j-term","writing a thesis is very difficult but definitely worthwhile","If you want to write a thesis I think the History of Science department is a good department to be in.","Undertake the task of writing a thesis only if you really feel like it will be intrinsically rewarding for you :) - it is a new challenge that is pretty stressful sometimes, so make sure you have a topic you're interested in and are willing to try something new and different!","Think about whether you want to do this and why.  Do you have long stretches of time?  Are you doing recruiting? Do you have the patience to sit and read books and books without knowing if they will eventually end up in your thesis?","Only do this if you are interested in writing a thesis. Not worth it if you feel like you are being forced to do so.","If you aren't sure about writing a thesis, do not take this course.  It is a tremendous commitment and will take up the better part of your senior year.  Professor Phillips makes light of it, but you will basically have no life outside of writing your thesis and trying to juggle the other work you have due at the same time."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["The thesis process is quite individual in nature; you learn how to really delve into academic material with limited guidance. It's the first chance that you have at truly being a scholar--and I think it's worth doing as a History of Science concentrator! The department is incredibly supportive, and the advising staff is wonderful.","If you're interested in pursuing your own academic research now or in the future, I 'd definitely recommend writing a senior thesis through History of Science - the thesis tutorial provides really great step-by-step help and Hist of Sci has great advisers, especially really excited and smart grad students, to help out","Writing a thesis is great but a lot of work. This class itself isn't really related to that, so write a damn thesis.","Write early and often.","While time-intensive, writing a thesis is AMAZING. You get to study in depth exactly what you want, on our own time, but realize that it takes time. TOTALLY WORTH IT.","I love writing a thesis. It is not easy and at many points you are not sure how your argument will turn out. Writing so many pages and planning a narrative of such broad scope is daunting. However, it is very satisfying and intellectually compelling to identify and think through the questions raised by one's sources, and as someone who loves writing, the thesis is ultimately a very fulfilling exercise. I strongly encourage anyone interested in testing their analytic skills and contributing something original to the field to go through this process.","Great for thesis work!","I found the fall semester of thesis research\/writing to actually be quite enjoyable. As long as you set deadlines for yourself and put in work on a consistent basis, producing the first chapter by December is not that stressful. Also, doing a bit of reading\/research in the summer is helpful!"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Hard but rewarding.","If you have a great thesis topic that you know you'll love digging into, definitely write one! The History of Science department is very flexible with helping you write a thesis on something you're really interested in, so it's a great opportunity to take if you know you'd enjoy writing a long paper.","Writing a thesis is like maintaining a romantic relationship: you love it to death but it can sometimes be filled with drama and stress. Your thesis advisor is like the relationship counselor.","Be prepared to make writing a senior thesis your top academic priority!","Great opportunity to do in-depth research on a topic of your choosing. Start early and sustain your work throughout the semester so that you don't scramble to produce your first chapter at the end.","The senior thesis process is the most challenging and stressful experience at times and the most rewarding and exciting at others. Remember that this is a race and you won't always be sprinting, but that's okay. Take your time, pace yourself, be patient with your ideas, and constantly write (even if painfully difficult to get words to page).","HistSci 99 provides a good amount of structure to the thesis-writing process, but does not overburden students with unnecessary deliverables or busy work.","i recommend if you want to write a thesis. If you are really busy outside of this class, it easily falls to the backburner because there aren't many deadlines. be careful of letting that happen."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.10","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"26","response rate":"69.23","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HISTSCI 99a","course_id":"2638","cat_num":"6619","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"8","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HISTSCI 99a","course_id":"2638","cat_num":"6619","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"15","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HISTSCI 99a","course_id":"2638","cat_num":"6619","1s":"0","2s":"11","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
