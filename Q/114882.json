If you have a chance to take any course with Professor St. John, do it!  Her enthusiasm for the field is infective, and her broad knowledge of the field is exceptional.","There is a TON of reading, but the majority of the books are interesting and Rachel is a great professor","If your looking for a class that will give you a strong headstart in understanding all the major issues of the 19th century, this course is for you.","Worthwhile background for exams (and a requirement!) but lobby your instructor vigorously to cut people from the class. It really needs to be capped ata a bout a dozen students or so.","You will be expected to read an enormous amount of material, but all of it is chosen with care and consideration, so it is generally very useful."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Fantastic course for preparing for generals.","The course is a required course for Americanist PhD students, but I would recommend any course with Rachel St. John with enthusiasm. She is a great professor--accessible, approachable, good facilitator, and smart.","Given that this course is a requirement for students in the American field in history, I'd omit them from this recommendation, but I'd suggest this course with the caveat that it is incredibly work-intensive.","It is a lot of reading; large class discussion can prove frustrating if not assertive; be sure and take good notes because you won't always get what you need out of the class itself.","Read, Read, Read!","Well, it's an important\/necessary class to take as a graduate student studying U.S. history.","The class is true to it purpose as a reading course.  The course is directed at preparation for comprehensive History exams.","As with all proseminars, this course requires very heavy reading but that is necessary background and training for students who would like to continue in the History track.","St. John has prepared a rich and challenging syllabus, and she guides the course through it with patience and dedication."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Forces you to discover the possibilities of historical writing and where your commitments lie.","Professor Johnson does an excellent job of choosing readings that are worthwhile and interesting.  The class discussion is usually very productive for students who come prepared.","Quickly figure how to read and know that you can't do it all."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"3.90","difficulty":"3.70","recommendation":"4.90","enrollment":"16","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 2442","course_id":"2490","cat_num":"2383","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"11"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 2442","course_id":"2490","cat_num":"2383","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 2442","course_id":"2490","cat_num":"2383","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"6","5s":"3"}},"success":true}
