Literally.","schedule your semester around it","I would tell them that in this class you will produce an amazing piece of work all your own and learn how to write direct and edit film, which is an amazing opportunity. However, to do this they must sacrifice every single weekend, the rest of their homework and oftentimes their sanity. For me it was worth it, for many it will not be. This class should only be taken if they are absolutely sure they want to go into the film arts in the future.","You need to be prepared to make this class your first priority. You will get incredible experience but you will struggle to keep up with your other classes and get enough sleep."]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["This class is a LOT of work, but will be the best decision you probably ever made in your life.","It will really depend on your professor.

It's a great learning experience."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["You should be prepared to do a LOT of work on your own!","This class will be what you make of it; work hard on your film and don't expect much out of the professor, because most of your learning will come from what you do.","The opportunity to make your own film in the spring is amazing--but be wary of a poor teacher, it is more than likely to have a teacher that will be a detriment rather than an aid.","You need to take this if you want to do a fiction thesis, and it will be with a different professor, so I don't know how much our experience is relevant.","Prepare to pour a lot of hours into your final project.","Good for learning how to make better fiction films.","On the basis of knowledge learned versus money paid, I would never recommend this course. I must mention, however, that it must be taken to qualify for a fiction thesis."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["VES150 is really the only fiction film class at Harvard that prepares you for making movies in the real world.  If you're looking at this, you probably already have some idea of whether you want to take it, and you already know that you're going to take it if you're a concentrator looking toward a fiction thesis.  Just know that a lot depends upon the teaching staff and your classmates, and that you get out of it what you put in, but that it's no walk in the park.  It has incredibly frustrating moments, but it can also be extremely rewarding.","It will transform you in the best way possible.","Philippe is an amazing teacher. I left his class everyday feeling the strong love for cinema that he felt and finding all my ideas challenged by his teaching.
