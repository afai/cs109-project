Considering we had never seen a literature review, anthropological methodology, or theoretical contribution paper before, having his help was incredibly useful.","I'm not sure if this class will be taught in the future but if so, I think this course is very much worth taking although it is important to realize that having a prior background will help significantly (and as such, lack thereof will make things challenging) but it's a fun and engaging departure from most of the dept's courses.","Topics and instructors change every year so it's a little hard to provide comments that will be relevant to future students. The one constant is that the class is taught by a grad student in their field of interest\/research. The tutorial is a great opportunity to refresh your perspective on what it means to study anthropology. It's fun to get to know and learn from someone who just got back from fieldwork and is engaged in research and other interesting projects, in a way that feels more real and exciting, and that differs from the usual routine of \"been there, done that, published a book and 10 articles about it (and you're going to read them all)\" that professors can sometimes fall into. \r\nMake the most of it.","Social movements in India was too narrow of a topic to stay interested all semester...","Definitely take this class if you are planning to write a thesis, although you shouldn't expect that it will take you, step-by-step, through the process of writing a solid prospectus and constructing good arguments. You'll get the structure of how it works, but will do most of that learning by trial and error with help from your thesis advisor. Instead, this class will give you the tools to analyze difficult and often lengthy readings in order to extract methods and theories that will eventually help you design your own research topic. It'll also give you the opportunity to present to a seminar-style class, which is a really effective way of ensuring that you understand the material and that you locate questions that will foster interesting discussions. Go to office hours, have your work read by other people, put in effort and you'll get a lot out."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This was definitely one of the best classes I've taken this semester. It was wonderfully organized and all the different sections linked very well with each other. Great way of thinking through a project for the semester or thesis for senior year.","This is a great junior tutorial, and especially useful if you are planning on writing a thesis. The course is very focused on the final paper,however, so I recommend taking another Anthro course at the same time that will provide interesting lectures, ethnographic readings and discussions, if you think you will miss that.","only take it if you are an anthro concentrator","Jared is amazing and wonderful, and the course was really helpful in figuring out what you are aiming for with your thesis.","Start thinking of ideas during the summer to jump in to research feet-first.","While some required concentration classes seem redundant, I found this course extremely valuable in developing my thesis topic.  You will not have your hand held, but if you put in the outside work and come to class with ideas the course will likely be rewarding to you.","Jared is amazing, insightful, honest, inquisitive. The class forced me to really consider my thesis project and where it should go, be shaped","So much better than the Anthro Sophomore tutorial","The best way to begin any sort of research project. Work closely with the instructor, do a good amount of research during the semester and don't be afraid to re-frame your research questions. Direct \"teaching\" is not a big part of the tutorial, but if you pay at least some attention, you will probably learn a thing or two that are useful for anthropology in general.","This course is a great pathway for those interested in writing a senior thesis. The feedback you receive is incredibly helpful, and your experience with the work will heavily depend on your interest in the topic you choose initially (though there is certainly flexibility in changing your topic).","This course pushes you to question how you write and collect data. You get to share ideas with colleagues and go through the process of deeply researching and revising, guided by the extremely helpful feedback from faculty mentors and peers.","You don't have an option, so try to really have some solid ideas for your thesis that you think you can commit to by the beginning of the year so that when you start this course you can make the most of it. If you are pretty confident about what you want to study this class will knock out a lot of work for your thesis work, which is great. If you don't have an idea you want to commit to you are going to feel really restless by the end of the course.","This course is mandatory. Do what you want to with it, and make sure you have an excellent TF.","This past year's tutorial (Fall 2013) was great and everything that I would hope to get out of an anthropology tutorial: being influenced and guided by the professor or graduate student's project as I work to form and develop my own.","it all depends who you have....pick a tutor and wish for the best. mine happened to be great, and his field of study pretty interesting too","Junior tutorial was a great experience. It did a great job of introducing you to the process of undertaking thesis research.","Make sure to ask your professor to provide his aims and expectations for each assignment in detail. Turning in an assignment thinking you have done it well and finding out that you did not approach it in the way that was desired can be frustrating when you had no idea before. Not to mention, challenging when you go back to edit. Interesting class though.","Great introduction to grant-writing, particularly for any students interested in writing a thesis."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["The course is fairly unstructured, definitely what you make of it. You can get a lot out of it depending on how seriously you take the weekly assignments, though. Many of the assignments are very ambiguous and unstructured, indicating some level of disorganization within the department or the teaching staff for the course, though.","This class is an excellent opportunity to learn about how to create a research project through extensive writing assignments as well as interesting conversations with knowledgeable graduate students and peers.","Just be aware that if your version of this course is anything like the version I took, this will be an extremely time-consuming course with very high expectations for the amount of reading and writing students will do.  If possible, I would highly recommend scheduling some easier courses when you take this course; I think even if I were only taking this course and had no extracurriculars, I would still have a difficult time completely finishing all of the work that was asked of me.","Read a book a week, and figure out what ethnography means early on.","Pick your topic early (you sort of have to). The class has two final paper options: 20 page senior thesis proposal or an ethnographic research paper, but the class is more geared towards the first option (maybe they will change it in subsequent iterations of the class). For the final paper, know the theories you will use. The theoretical underpinnings behind your own topic are not discussed in depth throughout the course, but towards the end and in your final paper, they are essential.","This class is really enjoyable and also super helpful in teaching you what anthropology is and also how to design and carry out research. The atmosphere is also really relaxed so you don't feel stressed but you still learn a lot. I also really liked that the class balanced very well giving us enough independence to pursue ideas that interested us while also providing a lot of support and supervision as we developed our research projects. Even if you are not writing a senior thesis, this class would be super useful in helping you decide if you are on the fence but also is really useful in helping you build up your reading and writing skills. If you are writing a senior thesis, it is wonderful because it gives you a headstart by over a year over a lot of other fields which is really nice.","Emrah is an INCREDIBLE tutorial leader. Also really use this course as an opportunity to do some deep thinking and planning about your thesis research.","It gives you introduction to work in anthropology and, if you want, thesis preparation. My friends from other departments were surprised to hear how meticulous and thoughtful the preparation is - and jealous, too. The more ideas and other courses in anthropology, the better you would be able to take out of the course.","This class is an excellent class to start building your thesis topic.","As a space where you can give and receive feedback without hesitation from your classmates, this tutorial has proved to be amazing. You will find that everyone has crazy awesome ideas and plans for their research and I found myself looking forward to hearing everyone's progress. However, as a class with weekly writing assignments and biweekly one-on-one feedback sessions with the TF, this has been one huge disappointment. I came into this class with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for my potential thesis topic but I left with a feeling of tedium and exhaustion from the repetitive assignments and impractical advice on my research topic. I think I learned more from being around my classmates and discussing our topics than actually speaking with the TF despite the mandatory biweekly meetings which weren't even all that useful.","The concepts covered in this class are amazing, but just be ready for busy work.","It all geared to making you write a thesis, whether you want to or not.","This class is great to truly delve into the process of developing an anthropology research question, reading the relevant literature, and discussing with other students.  By the end I felt more prepared to take on a thesis project.  The best part is hearing what other students are interested in and working on (and to be honest, it's probably one of the best parts about anthropology--the diverse and cool interests of other students).  Ramyar is also a great tutorial leader who will guide you and keep you on track."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"6.60","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.80","enrollment":"23","response rate":"91.30","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANTHRO 98za","course_id":"116","cat_num":"4503","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"6","4s":"6","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANTHRO 98za","course_id":"116","cat_num":"4503","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"17","4s":"3","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANTHRO 98za","course_id":"116","cat_num":"4503","1s":"1","2s":"9","3s":"6","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
