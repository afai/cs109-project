If you're interested in international business or entrepreneurship or work migration, you must take this class. Overall, if you're interested in migrant workers, international business ties, networks, or entrepreneurship, learn from Prof Garip who is the nicest professor ever. Hands down best professor I've had so far. And it's a 1:7 ratio so you get your voice heard.","If you're interested in any research topic dealing with immigration, business, international markets, or anything in between, this tutorial would be perfect for you. Professor Garip did a great job in helping us through the entire writing process!","This tutorial is really excellent! The course poses an array of interesting questions and ideas. If Filiz is teaching it again, she does a great job of leading the discussion, adjusting the course to match the interests of the class, helping with research issues, and writing lots of comments on early drafts of the final paper. I would definitely recommend!","This course is really interesting and it teaches you a lot by forcing you to write response papers on the readings.  Because everyone did the readings for the assignments, the discussion was always great.  The final paper is a lot of work, but Prof. Garip was very helpful every step of the way."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"3.40","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gc","course_id":"11161","cat_num":"16127","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gc","course_id":"11161","cat_num":"16127","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"SOCIOL 98Gc","course_id":"11161","cat_num":"16127","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
