'09":{"comments":["It's a well-organized introduction to the major questions in cell biology.  It teaches you the approaches that cell biologists use through lecture examples and problem sets.  A big plus is that you end up learning not through rote memorization, but rather through application of concepts.  Would recommend for anyone interested in acquiring a foundation in cell biology.","The class was interesting and informative and run really well.","CB201 has been my favorite course in graduate school! It is well organized, well taught, and well managed. There are 4 problem sets over material presented in class, along with discussion section each week. While the problem sets can be challenging, they are manageable. I highly recommend taking this course!","The course is informative, the assignments are fair and they help you learn a lot about cell biology.","It will not be very helpfull if you took a cell biology course already","Be sure to set aside a lot of time to dedicate to problem sets.","You will spend lots of time and energy on the problem sets.","As a starter in biological science, this is definitely the course you need to take.","This course is a bit dry, but it does cover useful topics that allow one to have a better understanding of the cell.","It was a reasonable amount of work, but I think most people will have already encountered this material in undergrad. So if you had never had cell bio I think it's a great overview course.","Cell Biology 201 is everything a graduate-level introductory course should be.  Topics succeed one another with great continuity, faculty are engaging and dedicated, and discussion sections are rigorous and stimulating.  I left the course not only with a strengthened foundation in cell biology but also with improved critical thinking skills.","The sections with faculty are great; the course is well-run and well-organized; and the lectures topics are covered by stars in each field (Mitchison on cytoskeleton, Brugge on apoptosis, to name a few).","Excellent!"]},"Spring '10":{"comments":["It's nice to take a class with a bunch of your class mates.  Some of the material is great (for me, the first half of the class).  Otherwise, the presentation and assignments in this class are often rather tedious and useless.","If you have a strong cell biology background, then take it.","this is a great overview of cell biology -- the professors are leaders in their field.  the lectures don't necessarily give you a clear, cohesive view of the subjects so you should go in knowing what you want out of the course, otherwise it is easy to get overwhelmed (and bored)","overall, i thought this was the best core course that i have taken that is required because it is very organized and the assignments are reasonable and the topics interesting.","This course is great even if you've never taken a cell biology course in the past.","Don't focus so much on the details but instead on big concepts and techniques.","A basic knowledge of cell biology is useful for any field.  This course does a good job at giving an introduction to many different areas in cell biology.","A great introduction to cell biology.","The lectures were very disappointing.  I had expected lecturers to be more engaging and excited about teaching students about their field of research.","The course is very informative and comprehensive, but requires lots of efforts.","My advisor strongly advised that I take this class because cell bio seems like such a fundamental topic regardless of what field you go into.  However, I did not feel like I learned anything new.  If you are not genuinely interested in cell bio, then I don't think it's worth taking the course.","This class is an overview, some of which will be familiar, some of which will fill in gaps from undergrad.  It is amazing how much of the material covered is relevant to research, even outside of the field of cellular biology.  The optional microscopy workshop is highly recommended.","There is a lot of busy work for assignments.  The weekly sections are very intimidating.","a solid course in cell biology- a good overview","The class does not build much on cell bio that many of us have had in undergrad, but is a good refresher with some insight into current areas of research.","not useful unless you have no cell biology background","Good, well designed course.  Will strengthen your cell biology knowledge.","Be aware that this class is a tremendous amount of work and is extremely time consuming.","You might be questioned why you didn't take this course during your PQE.","it is challenging for people without a firm knowledge of biochemistry","Audit the course and sit in on the lectures that interest you - don't bother with the sections.","Take this course if you want to use cell biology ever. The sections are very useful. Make sure you work well toward the papers. Classes can tend to be pretty boring though."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["Be prepared to do a lot of group work in the sections--it gets old quickly.","useful","Needs a little more of the logistics to be sorted out before it is a fully functional course (deadlines, submission processes).","course offers good coverage of key areas of research in cell biology","Hopefully this class will be better for you than it was for us.  They were trying some new things this term which made it quite a bit more difficult for us and the section leaders.  Perhaps it will be better in the future in terms of course work.  I generally found the lectures interesting and worth attending.","My adviser tried to talk me out of this class- I wish she had succeeded. While I think taking a cell bio course is important to graduate school education- this isn't that course. If you're looking for a series of lectures on research topics, this is your course. If your looking for a well taught class to give you the bigger picture of cell bio, look elsewhere.","Though problem sets and discussion sections might seem like a lot of work (particularly toward the end of the course), this course really gets you to think experimentally.","Sections are very useful for getting practice in discussing papers and designing experiments, but don't feel you have to attend the lectures if you already took cell bio in undergrad.","It requires work and you should not rely on TA for help.","The strength is in the content, but the assignments can be an exercise in frustration.","It provides a good foundation for the latest topics and questions in science and biology!","It was helpful to put your work in context, even if you're not doing something that requires much cell bio, such as bacterial genetics or structural biology.","a lot of work for a graduate level class. it's too intense, in my opinion","Good emphasis on experimental design and data interpretation. Likely to be useful for research. Lectures can be heavy.","Interesting topics covered, but the structure of the course needs a lot of work."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.40","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"3.50","enrollment":"47","response rate":"76.60","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CELLBIO 201","course_id":"3010","cat_num":"1044","1s":"1","2s":"6","3s":"13","4s":"10","5s":"6"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CELLBIO 201","course_id":"3010","cat_num":"1044","1s":"0","2s":"5","3s":"23","4s":"6","5s":"2"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CELLBIO 201","course_id":"3010","cat_num":"1044","1s":"8","2s":"16","3s":"7","4s":"4","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
