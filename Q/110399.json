I can tell.  The concept is great, the format is interesting, the content is significant... but the class itself needs work.  The reading is way too heavy... it didn't reflect the priorities of the course. and it was impossible to tell what the professors thought was important... or if they were citing a reading.  The goals were a little fuzzy. This was clear when we had a final exam but had no idea what could possibly be on it.  It ended up being more conceptual... like a final paper... but without the benefit of time or resources to aid the writing.  Overall, though, as an English major I learned a lot about economics and the world, in general.  I will trust anything Professor Engell tells me.  And I was pleased that the college was approaching this kind of cross-departmental course.","The professors are wonderful and the subject matter is very interesting. If they take the feedback that they receive - which will be that there were too many readings and not enough focus - this course will soon be one of the best at Harvard. It's a great survey course of modern issues as they pertain to different disciplines and modes of thought - definitely one of the most fulfilling classes at harvard - even if the structure wasn't as clear as it could have been.","This class has a ton of potential and I trust Engel and Friedman to make the necessary changes to make it a great class before it is offered again."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.50","workload":"1.50","difficulty":"2.50","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"8","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ECON 1000b","course_id":"11506","cat_num":"13465","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"3","5s":"0"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ECON 1000b","course_id":"11506","cat_num":"13465","1s":"1","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ECON 1000b","course_id":"11506","cat_num":"13465","1s":"3","2s":"3","3s":"0","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
