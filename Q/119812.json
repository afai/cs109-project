It will be your favourite class: I guarantee it.","Although in terms of sheer quantity of work, this class is pretty easy, be prepared to think like you've never thought before.","It's so good, I'm taking it again.","This class is a great chance to work with both an esteemed member of the composition faculty at Harvard (in our case, Professor Czernowin) and to share your work wih and learn from your peers. It is run kind of like a graduate seminar, with a few skill-building exercises and a final composition project (and performance), and most class sessions involve students presenting a piece or some work in progress to be class. The discussions that follow each presentation are invaluable; you can learn a great deal about just about everything from talking thoughtfully with peers and professors. Other classes were essentially lessons with Professor Czernowin, which are also incredibly interesting and useful. This is a food class to take if you are comfortable composing and looking to dig in and develop yourself as a composer more deeply.","I will tell future students that Professor Czernowin is an excellent musician but that the course structure is totally insufficient to actually help composers out.","Chaya is a fantastic teacher, and her insight and perspicacity often leave you speechless. Jump at the opportunity to take this course. IMPORTANT: DO NOT BE SCARED AWAY BY MUSIC DEPT. REQUIREMENTS OF \"FOUR SEMESTERS OF THEORY OR MUSIC 150 OR EQUIVALENT.\" If you have a background in composition, just come talk to Chaya and show her a few scores."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This is a structured seminar for composers. If you compose a great deal outside of class, why not take it? In addition, it provides the opportunity to have your work performed and recorded, a highly valuable exercise. Of course, the structure of this course will vary year to year depending on who's teaching it.","If you're a composer, JLA is awesome to work with."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Chaya is a fantastic teacher and you will get great feedback from her. The class is worth taking even if solely to develop a relationship\/contact with her for the future. But more than that, she has drastically influenced my approach to writing music.","Professor Czernowin has a lot of extremely insightful things to say about composition, but it would have been helpful to receive more private instruction from her. We had very few (and short) private lessons, and as a result I didn't really grow as much as I could have from her expertise. The course was a mix of seminar format and private lessons, but I thought some of the group meetings could have been replaced by private lessons.","This is an excellent course to take if you've written some music for yourself but have never had the experience of receiving (and giving) detailed critiques of it.  I felt that my creative horizons had expanded significantly from the beginning to the end of the course, though not without a decent amount of struggle at the beginning.  Also, Trevor Baca alone could make any class worth taking.  Highly recommended, even for people like me who are not music concentrators.","The more you put into this class, the more you get out of it. I highly recommend putting more effort than you absolutely have to into this class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.70","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.70","enrollment":"9","response rate":"66.67","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MUSIC 161r","course_id":"3643","cat_num":"6714","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MUSIC 161r","course_id":"3643","cat_num":"6714","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MUSIC 161r","course_id":"3643","cat_num":"6714","1s":"1","2s":"3","3s":"1","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
