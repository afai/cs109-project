The teaching staff is amazing. You will be able to approach literature in an entirely new way if you take this course.","Take it. You won't regret it. It was by far my favorite class throughout the entire semester. The class is small and personal and all of the faculty on board are truly brilliant, thoughtful and insightful. You're tool belt for analyzing literature and various texts will be greatly supplemented in a way you did not and perhaps could not ever expect.","If you're thinking about taking this class, DO IT. Homi and Peter make a great teaching team and although the course can be frustrating occasionally (this semester there were some organizational issues but those are hopefully going to be avoided next semester). Discussions are great in seminar and section and it's a manageable workload.","This class goes BEYOND any you've ever taken before. With scholars to the likes of Professor Bhaba and Sacks, every class is a treat in its own.","Very solid class, particularly for non-humanities concentrators. The teaching staff is great and the workload is very reasonable!","This course offers a great foundation in the humanities, no matter what you ultimately decide to go into. If you have already decided your concentration, the course is a great way to satisfy Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding. The readings are interesting and the topics and issues that they raise will return occasionally in the course."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.40","workload":"2.20","difficulty":"2.60","recommendation":"4.60","enrollment":"17","response rate":"47.06","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HUMAN 11c","course_id":"11009","cat_num":"84969","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"5","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HUMAN 11c","course_id":"11009","cat_num":"84969","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HUMAN 11c","course_id":"11009","cat_num":"84969","1s":"0","2s":"6","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
