However, the department as a whole is friendly and very invested in your success.  You will learn Russian, and you will learn it correctly.  The process may not be easy, but the results are worth it.","This is a great way to improve your Russian, though a lot of it is (somewhat annoyingly) review; but there's no real way to get around that in a second-year language course. This takes Slavic A material and goes deeper, and is also more demanding, making sure you actually know all the nuances this time.

Assignments occur daily, and you truly are expected to keep up with and complete all of them.

But it's worth it: you'll be amazed how quickly your comprehension improves.","This is the best language course in any language.  If you have the ability, take up Russian just so you can take part in the Slavic Department's wonderful curriculum.","You will get as much out of it in terms of actually learning the Russian language as you put in.","Russian is a difficult language and definitely requires a heavy investment of time and patience but it is worth sticking til the intermediate level if you want any conversational ability. In intermediate, it starts to feel like the time you spent on Russian at the beginning stage is finally paying off in terms of the progress you make and the ability you have.","It takes great commitment and enthusiasm for the language itself, but it is definitely helps you to learn the language well in a very structured way. The faculty members are the the greatest asset of this course, and they are wonderful  people to be learning a language from.","This class is very well organized and it effectively teaches students the Russian language and provides ample opportunities to practice the language.","The class's function is basically to review the Russian from Slavic A.","This is a challenging but very enjoyable class. Readings and course materials are great and the teaching staff is very friendly and helpful.","Like all language classes at Harvard, it's intense.  But the very small sections and dedication of the teaching staff mean you learn a huge amount, and even in the course of one semester I feel like I've improved so much.  It's challenging, and you absolutely have to stay on top of homework.","Excellent course, but be prepared for constant hard work, especially if you have not taken Slavic A at Harvard. You must manage your time in any language course at Harvard in order to ensure that you can work over all the material, but the Slavic Department is particularly demanding.","Wonderful course with excellent materials centered on Russian literature and culture. Focus on articulation will undoubtedly improve the quality of your pronunciation. Be prepared to do a lot of work, often substantially in excess of the 15 credit hours assigned for the course, especially if you come into the course without having taken Slavic A."]},"Spring '11":{"comments":["If you want to learn Russian (well), take this class- The quality of this Russian instruction can't be beat. While its a difficult class, the faculty always makes it worthwhile and are very helpful. I would also recommend this over intensive Russian because it gives you more time to let the different components of the language sink in.","This class will teach you a great deal of Russian grammar and vocabulary, and it will prepare you to read, write, and speak Russian at a high level.","This course was by far the best and most exiting way to learn a language.","This is a really fun class in which you'll learn a lot not only about Russian language but also about Russian culture, history, and mentality. The professor and the TFs are great and the whole Department is very friendly.","Get a dictionary, and also Multitran, the online Russian-English dictionary. (It's not the easiest thing on the internet to find, but once you have it, you'll find yourself using it a lot.) Get both. Without both of them, you will find yourself confronted with unglossed words you are supposed to know.","Must have enough commitment for the language. For graduate students of other schools, especially professional schools, the schedule conflict is a major issue and it may be very difficult to manage the workload. As long as you feel committed and enthusiastic about the language, I would highly recommend future students to take this class because it truly has the best faculty and teaching quality in Russian, even compared to those offered in Russia itself. The course material (textbooks, and hand outs) are exceptional. I have personally had the chance to see and use many other textbooks in the past, but never has the quality of course materials been as high and great as the ones we used in Slavic B. And it can be entirely be attributed to Professor Reed and the teaching fellows of Slavic B because they have shown great commitment to improving and updating the course materials as fast and accurately and conveniently as possible.","This course is excellent for serious students of Russian. The professor and TFs are dedicated, open to meeting outside of class to give extra help and have high expectations.","This is an epic, intensely rigorous class. But it's also a miracle of efficiency and effectiveness that's run with precision, care, and great sophistication by hard-working, memorable scholars of language and literature. Some reservations are necessary, of course: grad-students who are taking the class purely for reading-knowledge\/article-skimming-proficiency will often feel like they're trying to light a cigarette with a flamethrower. But even if you start the class with hardly any reading proficiency at all, you'll be able to read complex materials by the end of the year-- which is pretty astonishing for this difficult language. I'm amazed by my newfound reading-comprehension, and deeply grateful to these masters of pedagogy who facilitated it. Also, grad students in this class will get a new appreciation for the work-ethic of harvard undergrads: my younger classmates were absolutely extraordinary, world-class students."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["Russian is an amazing and challenging language. It is surprisingly expressive, and it is enjoyable to learn the nuances and subtle implications of verbal aspect, which is a significant component of the first half of Slavic B.","This is a very rigorous course... It is possibly more demanding than an intensive introductory course. Nataliya Aleksandrovna is an inspirational teacher, and her perfectionism may take a lot away from you in terms of grades, but you will have a better grasp of Russian in the end.","Take it if you want to hone up your skills from Slavic A. It will teach you to be culturally aware as you actually utilize grammar. Also, Natalia Reed is simply the sweetest person ever.","Natalia Aleksandrovna is an exceptional language instructor!!!","The course is difficult and you may lose sight of why you originally decided to take Russian, but if you can push through that, it is still worth taking. Teaching staff are great as always."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Great class; really enjoyed it.","It's a lot of hard work, but that also means that this class really pushes you to move beyond beginning Russian and into more complex expression. Sometimes it feels like a lot of busy work, though (ie, memorizing that Pushkin poem and memorizing the dialogues for the oral exam), so that's why I didn't give it top marks.","The key to this class is consistent work, as it is easy to fall behind on the memorization\/exercises. Near-complete mastery of Slavic A will go a long way towards success in this class.","The class starts out slow to ensure that you still have a solid foundation in basic Russian, but the pace starts to pick up after a few weeks. Soon, you will see your language skills improve dramatically and by the end of the semester you will easily be able to converse in Russian about the course readings.","Take this class if you are willing to make Russian learning your priority","Not only will you definitely learn a lot, but this course is also a lot of fun! I highly recommend it to people further interested in the study of Russian."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["This course is necessary for continued Russian study.  We do much more textual analysis than Slavic A, and I'm sure that's getting us ready for more academic work to come.  There is less independent speaking than in first-year Russian.","My reservation is just the amount of English spoken in class by the instructor;","This course is great! Definitely take it if you liked first year Russian.","If you're going to continue with Russian, make sure that you at least enjoyed\/felt comfortable in Russian A\/Aab. It gets tougher and truly builds upon that knowledge with reasonable review, so you don't have to be an Introductory Russian expert, but at least make sure you like it because you'll be spending tons of time on it.","Slavic B is a good review of grammar and helps to deepen knowledge of the Russian language  through extensive vocabulary lists. While class may not be the most exciting thing every day, I still feel I am learning a lot and that my comfort level with the language is growing. This course accomplishes exactly what is promises--a lot of grammar and new vocabulary. Exams and quizzes are extremely fair, no surprises, and help reinforce key concepts. It was also fun to read a text in the original Russian.","This class will challenge you, but the teaching staff is incredible, and I know my Russian has improved immensely because of this course.","This is a great class! You'll learn a lot of Russian, although opportunities to apply those skills in conversation may have to be sought outside of the classroom."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Not the easiest language to study.","If you love Russian and really wish to pursue it, you should look forward to this class. By the end, you really begin to feel as if you're starting to master the language. A wonderful department, a great teaching staff, and awesome materials all help to make this a great experience.","This course is, in my opinion, a necessary part of learning Russian grammar solidly and completely. The course allows students to learn grammar more in depth while incorporating essential bits of Russian history and real Russian literature. The spring semester is definitely more challenging. The oral exams are quite frustrating to study for, however, as I spent hours memorizing monologues (five or six of them, each a page long) and only needed to perform one--selected for me at random--on the exam. Start these early to make studying and memorizing more manageable.","From what I've heard, the entire course structure of this class will be changing next year, so I can't speak to the new material. But in my experience this class provided an excellent foundation in important grammar topics and improved my vocab and writing considerably. However, there was little to no conversational speaking practice, which I saw as a pretty severe shortcoming, for a language class. Most of the times that we spoke in class, we were just reading exercises straight out of the textbook. Still, I'd recommend the class.","Someone once told me that second year Russian was much harder than first year Russian--they lied. If you're still interested in Russian, definitely take it, but if your interest is waning, very carefully consider whether you want to spend another 1 or 2 semesters going on.","This course is some seriously hard work, but so worth it. I am so much more conversationally fluent as a result of the dedication these teachers have put into this course."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["Although the first semester is grammar-heavy, this is a phenomenal course. Building on and refining what you learned in Russian A is challenging, but extremely satisfying.","do the reading.","It's a bit of a grind at times but it really helps solidify grammar","A really good Russian class. I found it to be a lot of fun and I feel that my language skills have really improved as a result of this class. It can be a lot of work, but make sure you put in the time to learn the language outside of the class, or you will begin to fall behind. Both instructors are super available and super awesome, always willing to help you with your Russian. This course really helped my confidence and speaking ability, and we also learned a decent amount about culture.","Take the class for the instructors. Veronika Aleksandrovna is new to the department, but she is just as good or better than the rest of the Russian preceptors, who have awesome reputations. Daniel is very good as well. I think it's great to have a native English speaker teach Russian B, since it is so grammar heavy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"7.80","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"7","response rate":"71.43","QCourseOverall":{"number":"RUSS B","course_id":"4521","cat_num":"3262","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"2","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"RUSS B","course_id":"4521","cat_num":"3262","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"4","4s":"2","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"RUSS B","course_id":"4521","cat_num":"3262","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"2","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
