'12":{"comments":["It requires some hard work to get used to, but definitely worth it!","a very useful course to have a general understanding of how disease may initiate and develop with some information about how disease will affect the normal physiological processes."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["If the way in which material is presented is changed to focus more on what a graduate student\/research scientist would need to know, I think the course would be improved and more useful.","Overall, the course doesn't feel that cohesive, but covers a lot of interesting topics and gives you a good overview of pathology. I really enjoyed this course for the most part. Exams are pretty easy and don't require knowing much outside of what's covered in lecture. Labs and field trip are great!","I am very grateful for what I learned in this course, but unless the course undergoes a serious revamping with involved and teaching TAs, more clear lecturers and better course organization with an established set of expectations, students will face way more aggravation than any learning opportunity. It's a shame, because I found the labs on Thursdays to be AMAZING and incredibly informative and all of the topics to be really important in human biology.","It is a comprehensive overview of a great deal of pathology, don't get bogged down in the details of the disease but just be aware of the basics. The lab is very cool, if you like gross specimens- this specimens had a great deal of impact and I will remember the details of the lung and other organs for a lifetime.","the labs are very interesting and different from any other \"basic science\" courses in the curriculum. the professors genuinely care about the students personally and academically! the speakers cover a wide range of interesting topics that are very relevant to biomedical science today. that being said, students should know that the class covers a lot of breadth with little depth, so sometimes it can feel like you're being exposed to many new topics without a clear narrative.","I like the course, but the class could be organized in a better manner. There are too many different topics arranged for one day for the second half."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["It was a fantastic class and I learned a lot.","It was super fun and interesting to learn about diseases and be given lectures by prominent doctors\/scientists in the field."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"1.80","difficulty":"3.20","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"9","response rate":"55.56","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HBTM 200","course_id":"3171","cat_num":"10575","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"3"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HBTM 200","course_id":"3171","cat_num":"10575","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HBTM 200","course_id":"3171","cat_num":"10575","1s":"3","2s":"1","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
