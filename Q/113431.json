I 'got' everything in this course, and then I got screwed in the grading). Still, I would recommend it as a statistics course based on what I have heard about other statistics courses...

You'll learn stat, but not be stressed about it!","I would recommend this course as a good way to fulfill the math requirement. There is not any calculus involved and most of the math can be done with algebra.","Course is well taught and very informative. I can now understand several academic papers with statistical language as well as design studies of my own.","While I cannot speak to the other introductory stat courses, this one is a great introduction to statistics with a manageable workload.","This is a great course. You really get to learn statistical skills that will help you throughout your time at Harvard. Please, put the work in. Problem sets will take more time than you think they will. If you get stuck, rewatch the lecture video; it helps! Also, get lots of help on the project from the TF. While this course does not require much work or time, it requires diligence.","Don't let the easiness of the first few assignments fool you.  They get progressively harder and take more and more time.  Make sure you are paying attention and learning the concepts all along rather than cramming everything at the end."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Overall, this course was a good intro stats course. Since this was the first year Professor Miratrix was teaching, there were some kinks that had to be worked out, but I think in the end, all of us learned from the experience. Professor Miratrix is super receptive to student feedback and suggestions and really helpful and understanding during office hours. A word of caution is that the material covered under Professor Miratrix's teaching is not exactly like that which is covered in Stat 104 (which my roommate took at the same time I was enrolled in Stat 100). The focus here is much more on randomization\/bootstrapping, and there was only one lecture spent on probability (and that was towards the very end). Midterm was too long for the allotted time, but the final was fair and decently timed. Finally, we learned R (instead of STATA) in this class, which has a steep learning curve and is more complicated. Definitely take advantage of the online question center Piazza if you have questions about writing your code.","take stat 104 instead, this class is way too much work for a gen ed. the homeworks will take you around 8-11 hours a week and you won't even get that much out of them.","The information is very easy. The professor was just very disorganized, which usually resulted in vague questions on p-sets and ineffective lectures. Hopefully this changes though.","Although the class is supposedly a less intensive version of Stat 100, it actually appears to be more work and more difficult.","Very fast and can be challenging.","This course was extremely useful and practical. I thoroughly recommend the course, and students should not be discouraged for a lack of background in math or science.","If you do not have a strong math background and are taking this class to fulfill the GenEd, do yourself a favor and take Stat 104. Miratrix means well, but he ends up making things a lot more difficult than he thinks they will be.","take stat 104","only really take it if you have to--otherwise the problems will seem too irrelevant","It's not necessarily hard because the material is hard; it's hard because it's taught too quickly, not very clearly, and with an unfamiliar and highly temperamental statistics program, R.","take stat 104","Lots of people don't know this course exists. I don't know why. It is a great introduction to the practice of statistics. It teaches you practical (read: computer) skills, and is taught by faculty who genuinely care about their performance. It has the downsides of a lower-level course: apathetic peers, instructors who obviously are way to qualified to be teaching this, etc. But you can look back and say \"I learned relevant, practical stuff\". That's the goal of any course.\r\nGreat way to get math out of the way-- not too demanding, you actually might use some of this stuff in the future.","If you would like to learn the more practical, computer-based uses of the statistical skills, then take this class. If not, then the class might be unnecessarily challenging.","While difficult, I now feel knowledgable enough about statistics to apply the concepts I learned to any other field I might consider."]},"Spring '13":{"comments":["This class teaches you the basics and is fairly easy to pass if you dedicate time to it.","Stat 100 is great! The smaller class size was awesome, and allowed for individual questions to be answered. Professor Harrington is SO friendly and approachable. And Viviana is amazingly helpful, so don't skip section! If you want a much smaller, slightly slower paced (but just as informative) version of Stat 104, look no further.","This class is great.","Stat 100 is a true gem. The teaching staff is fantastic and the material is relevant. You learn practical stat skills and have a good time doing it. For anyone without a statistics background, this course is a must, you will not regret it! The time commitment required is minimal, and going to section will save you lots of time on the problems sets.","This is a great class if you are looking for a crash course in statistical analysis, especially if you are hoping to become involved in the social sciences.","The usual recommendations: psets are not easy, and there were 11 of them in my semester.  Attend every lecture; the lectures sometimes diverge from the textbook in important ways.  Sections were indispensable.","Professor Harrington is a great teacher- the best teacher I have had a Harvard!","Keep up with the class, especially towards the end of the course","I don't understand why Stat 104 has overtaken stat 100 completely - Professor Harrington is awesome, so is Viviana, its a really painless course, the material is actually kind of fun - I highly recommend keeping this course when Prof Harrington is keeping it and would recommend it to anyone","What we learn is very practical, you never feel like you're learning something you'll never use in real life. Professor is clear, straightforward. Recommend this course completely.","This class isn't stressful. Just go to class and take careful notes, and you'll be fine. Access to a lot prep material for quizzes\/exams is extremely nice, and with the schedule laid out for you ahead of time, you know exactly what you're getting into.","Statistics is nothing like regular math classes. It's conceptual in a different way, so be sure you're genuinely interested in statistics itself and not jus trying to avoid numerical computations before you take this class.","if you have recently taken AP stats this might be too slow for you. However, if you like small classes this might be the right course for you. Small class = you actually have to go to class so keep that in mind"]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["I would say that this is a good intro stats course, and you will get to play with R, but you will probably want more stats because it doesn't deal with post hoc tests and more complex statistics.","Take a different course until this one gets higher q scores and better organization. Maybe 2015","Be prepared to learn on two-fronts. You must be ready to understand statistics well enough to answer conceptual questions. However, you must also be ready to understand how to use R in order to answer some other questions. Frankly, R becomes way less painful when you understand what you are statistically trying to do. Personally, I would say having some knowledge of statistics helps.","It is a great class, but more work than you think.","The easiest Stat available at Harvard- take it if you need a Stat and hate math. Miratrix is also a good professor. It's generally painless.","It's a good class to learn foundational statistics and good analytical software. Knowing a bit of stats is definitely helpful but do the reading and go to office hours and you'll be fine.","This course is slightly disorganized and is, to be honest, not the most engaging of stats course you could take. The exams are very fair (and only one final and one midterm) but the p-sets, though only nine of them, were quite painful week-to-week, as it most often required me figuring out R code, as opposed to learning concepts. Plus side- nice professor and TF that are helpful, however, be ready to put in quite a bit of work. There is also a project component and it was a good experience!","It's a great introduction to statistics taught by a professor who really knows his stuff!","It's a fun and challenging course!","This is a tricky introductory level statistics class, especially since the program used, R Software, is hard to use, especially when you are trying to translate to concepts learned into code. I definitely recommend having some computer programming background and it helps tremendously to have taken a stat class prior to this course.","This class is useful for a lot of things, but not for your GPA. Be prepared to work really hard and be discouraged by the p-sets. Overall, the information you learn will help you with future work, especially in the social sciences, but it was disorganized, confusing, and hard at times.","The course's pace is really reasonable, but it is hard to get questions answered outside of class.  Additionally, there is a coding component to the class, so if you know you do not like coding, I recommend giving it a second thought before fully committing.","The professor and the TF do as much as they could to help you out and make sure you're not lost because simulation\/ codes can be hard in the beginning. The psets did get better, and the final project and final were a lot of time and effort, but definitely worth it. Take this class!","Go to office hours for help on the pset! And read the book- which is especially helpful if you read it right after the lecture relating to it! This class is great.","This course can be a bit difficult and confusing at times, but overall is a very good introduction to statistics. More helpful is the working knowledge it gives on how to use statistics.","If you need to take this class, then it gives a good background of statics, but it can be unnecessarily difficult at times because of faulty organization or complicated problem sets. R can be annoying, but if you have some background with that technology it would be better for you going in.","this is an awesome class to take. it is not stressful and luke is a great instructor. beware of the exams though, they can throw you off track.","Very good introduction to quantitative research."]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["This class is better than Stat 104. We use a computer package that is more relevant than Stata in the current world. Plus it focuses on the most important concepts one would need to pursue further studies in Statistics, say by taking Stat 139.","do the R tutorials","The class can be a bit challenging if you don't have a background in R, but you will soon catch up and be writing code in no time! In fact, it's pretty darn empowering!","I've heard that this course is being removed, and that's definitely for the best. There are no redeeming aspects to this course.","If you cannot code or find coding extremely difficult and tedious, do not take this course. If you are looking for a statistics course that will teach you primarily mathematical statistical analysis, do not take this course. Take this course if you want to learn tools for survey analysis and data crunching -- through coding. Coding. Coding. Coding. I can't say this enough: enter with a coding background or a willingness to focus extensively on coding for the entire semester. Don't let the first two weeks deceive you. This class will eat up your semester if you aren't comfortable. With. Coding..... Coding. I will say it again. Coding.","This course will prepare you to work in an environment where data is generated (which is everywhere!).  You will learn how to look at data in many different contexts.","Easy class","The class is a fairly good introduction to statistics, but the lectures are a bit disorganized and did not generate much enthusiasm for the topic. Having never taken statistics before, I felt like I learned a fair amount, but I question whether someone looking to take an intro course should not consider this one and just enroll in 104","Too much emphasis on learning R. There are other programs with just as much utility like Stata that will frustrate you much less.","Take this class instead of STAT 104. The professor is incredibly understanding, and learning R is really useful and not that hard. I love the way R is integrated in this course, in which it's not much pressure to really learn how to code but find the usefulness of it beyond the course. I also really like the pace of this course, which is much more slow and drawn out, especially for a non-math\/stat person like me. It's not that hard if you put the work into it, and I recommend going to section even if it's optional.","Go to class, read\/skim the textbook, and use the homework to solidify concepts (and try to start it early :P ). It's not a super difficult class, although it does require a bit of time when you have your homework assignments."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.60","workload":"6.50","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"3.40","enrollment":"16","response rate":"75.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"STAT 100","course_id":"4827","cat_num":"3808","1s":"1","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"STAT 100","course_id":"4827","cat_num":"3808","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"13","4s":"10","5s":"5"},"QWorkload":{"number":"STAT 100","course_id":"4827","cat_num":"3808","1s":"2","2s":"4","3s":"4","4s":"1","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
