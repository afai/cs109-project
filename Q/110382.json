The teaching staff all work raelly hard to be engaging and to present the material in interesting ways.  Sections were actually great and added to the class in a way that most sections don't.  There was a ton of reading but I didn't do most of it and still got a lot out of the class.","I learned to like this class by the end. It is more science-heavy than humanities. During lecture it was basically all about the science behind the disease, until the last few lectures where it was pretty integrative. I often wished section were longer because only during section did we discuss the humanities aspects of the class and one hour is not enough. The Professors are very passionate about the material, though the science can be confusing and sometimes pretty dry, and the TFs are great. It was a little disorganized, but it is the first time being taught.","This is a really interesting course and worth taking. The staff is very accessible and genuinely interested in making the course the best it can be. It's interdisciplinary, which means there will be a portion of the course you may not be too fond of. If you're nervous about your science background this is an easy way to fulfill SLS. The only times you're tested on science is at 4 take-home, open book exams. Don't be fooled, they're still pretty difficult but if you refer to the relevant readings and remember lecture (and get good at googling) you'll be set. The subject is really relevant and it's a pretty rare course for focusing on it.","Hard to take the class seriously","This course has good material, but the teaching is hit-or-miss. Don's a good lecturer, but not everyone is quite so great.","The science portion of the course is great, but although the professors are very enthusiastic they have problems teaching the humanities\/social science aspect of it. The science is also fairly difficult, not sure I would take it without some sort of background in science - I did not have any background and found it hard going for the first few weeks.","This course provides a good science class for students who either think they are not \"science people\" or are not sure whether or not they are \"science people.\" The professors and TFs make the class a great experience.","The teaching staff are AMAZING and you should definitely take this course!!!","really interesting, engaging, and fun. plus excellent teaching staff.","SLS26 is new class with great ideas. It needs a little fine tuning (the readings can be long, but you don't have to finish them all; the lectures were sometimes an awkward mix of discussion and lecture) but in general it is a fascinating class that is great for non-science-y people, bolstered by a great teaching staff who really care about you. The quizzes may be a little hard if you aren't science inclined, but make sure to use all the resources you're provided (open book). The professors, and especially the TFs, really care about how you're doing, and are proactive about reaching out to you. The exam is really fair, and just requires general knowledge on the readings. I learned a lot from the this class, and would especially recommend it now that it's going into its second year.","The class effectively bridges science and the humanities, and the professors and TFs are really understanding and want you to do well. They care about you as people and not simply as students.","This class was a little disorganized, which makes sense seeing as this was the first year. I still had a lot of fun, though. I think tailoring the objectives of the course to maybe include a little less science and more humanities or finding some way to construct the curriculum to establish a clearer pattern of how the scientific element affects the humanities element or vice versa would help the course immensely. Lots of cool roleplaying activities, which was fun, but I'm uncertain as to how some of the roleplaying contributed to the integration of science and the humanities in the context of epidemics.","A great way to fulfill SLS!  The teaching staff is some of the most enthusiastic you'll ever see, and the professors have a long line of experience in health fields.  It's a great survey of all the major diseases and their impacts on society.  Sometimes it can get a bit bogged down in the science (without much motivation to remember it since the basic science is only tested in open notebook quizzes) but usually the material is engaging and interesting.  Plenty of guest lecturers too!  Section is great and fun, the TF's are amazing, and you'll look forward to it!  My only major complaint is that the reading assignments were extremely variable in length and sometimes felt unfocused or completely unnecessary.","This class was everything that a humanities concentrator would want out of a science class. At moments, I felt myself leaning towards premed again but was always well supported by the teaching staff for not being premed. They truly welcomed individuals from all backgrounds, concentrations, and points of view.","Definitely take this because the professors are willing to work with you and help you learn.","This is a fun and enjoyable Gen-Ed. Though the frequent small assignments are a bit of a bother, the teaching staff is amazing and fully dedicated to making the course work. You'll learn a ton about a variety of diseases both scientifically and otherwise. Whether your angle is art, ethics, development, history, or english this course has something to offer you.","Heads up for a lot more science than you might have thought","It's a good SLS class for those who are not scientifically inclined as it doesn't have weekly PSets or anything like that, but there is still a good amount of science, so be prepared to deal with that. The teaching staff is very enthusiastic and works hard to make the class interesting, and they have a ton of experience on the subject. Not the most difficult class, but switching between hard science and looking at plague art can be taxing.","Class is pretty easy but can be interesting if you take advantage of all of the readings (which you don't actually ever have to do).","Despite being a fairly new course, this class is very well-structured, with a highly knowledgeable and accessible teaching staff and a well-chosen, though vast, set of readings and materials. Though occasionally quite challenging in the area of the science studied, this class is great at providing you with the support you need, and encouraging you to appreciate how amazing the material is. This class has a lot of guest lecturers, all of which who bring diverse and fascinating perspectives to the material; it was wonderful, for example, to listen to Dr. Richard Cash lecture on his experiences developing ORS in Bangladesh."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.00","workload":"4.40","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.10","enrollment":"31","response rate":"87.10","QCourseOverall":{"number":"SCI-LIVSYS 26","course_id":"12392","cat_num":"73923","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"16","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":null,"course_id":null,"cat_num":null,"1s":null,"2s":null,"3s":null,"4s":null,"5s":null},"QWorkload":{"number":"SCI-LIVSYS 26","course_id":"12392","cat_num":"73923","1s":"3","2s":"21","3s":"1","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
