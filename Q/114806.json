I initially took the course to fill my theory requirement but I got more out of it than I had expected. I think the material covered is fun and widely applicable to all areas of computer science.","CS 223 provides a very challenging but satisfying introduction to important and often underappreciated ideas in computer science.","It starts out easy and gets hard...","dont collaborate to learn best.","it's a hard class, but very cool and very worth it.  mitzenmacher is the best cs professor!","If you are interested in learning how to harness randomness and probability for the construction or analysis of computer science algorithms, this is a solid, fundamental course that does just that.","This is an extremely challenging course, professor wasn't too accessible which made the experience frustrating at times. It's an interesting course, but could use some improvements.","Great class, awesome professor, and useful material."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["It's math.","I enjoyed very much taking this course. I view it as an upgraded version of CS124, where Prof Mitzenmacher seems a lot less intimidating. Interesting material and well written book\/ notes.","The homeworks are challenging and there is often a trick to the problems that you need to see in order to get them. I'd probably work with a partner if I were doing it over again.","I feel that I have much deeper understanding about probability, and how to use probability to analyze many things. I highly recommend this class.","An interesting class, starting by reviewing the basics to finish by providing nowadays applications and discoveries. Very good professor.","This is an incredibly interesting, fun class... and really useful if you ever become a software engineer!","This is a very nice class. The pace feels slow, and the techniques are very elementary, but it covers some pretty sophisticated and powerful ideas, e.g. applications of martingales to discrete problems. It's not so much a probability theory-building class as a class on topics and problems that Mitzenmacher likes, which to his credit are generally very interesting. The workload was pretty chill."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.28","workload":"3.33","difficulty":"3.83","recommendation":"4.39","enrollment":"20","response rate":"90.00","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 223","course_id":"1258","cat_num":"4740","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"3","4s":"7","5s":"8"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 223","course_id":"1258","cat_num":"4740","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"6","4s":"9","5s":"3"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 223","course_id":"1258","cat_num":"4740","1s":"0","2s":"3","3s":"7","4s":"7","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
