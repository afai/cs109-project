While there is some repetition in the course material, I feel that the freedom of the final paper and the presence of Professor May make up for this.  While the final assignment is a big one, there is a great deal of guidance and suggestion given throughout the course from both the teaching staff and the other students in the seminar.","Wonderful instructor, engaging material, and ample time to develop, research, and write a seminar-length essay.","You can't really go wrong with this class: the professor is excellent, the subject matter is captivating, and the work you will do every week is fascinating."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is a really interesting and well-taught course! The workload was fairly hefty, but if you're interested in the subject matter it's definitely worth it.","If you want to learn historiography, take the class. If you want to learn about Vietnam and why the Vietnam War continues to be an open wound in American society, look elsewhere. This class does a disservice to the war and the cultural trauma it caused.","This class is a highly rewarding history class that leaves you feeling well informed about an incredibly complex era of US and Vietnamese History. The class has a high workload, but it is worth it in the end if you have an interest in this topic.","The class was amazing, as were the professors. This is a great example of a well-taught small sized class. I loved that every lecture was a discussion, and that the professors were super engaging. It was a challenging class that I found very much worth it. The professors are also very willing to meet outside of class, and besides learning the material, I thought that my over writing skills improved as well."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["This class is fantastic. It gives a fantastic background of the events that led to American involvement in Vietnam from both Vietnamese and American perspectives, and covers cultural, political, and military elements of the American war in Vietnam. It was a great class overall.","If you like the subject matter, this is an awesome course. The teaching team was great and we covered so many factors of the war that wouldn't have been possible to cover in a different course.","If you want to have an introduction to the Vietnam War, this is the class for you. If you already know a lot about the Vietnam War, this is not the class for you.","Here in the US, we typically learn about the Vietnam War from a strictly American perspective. This was a great opportunity to broaden my horizons. Lectures were good, not always great, but overall, I would recommend this class.","This course has a lot of reading and may be difficult for someone who is not used to history courses at Harvard, but is well worth it in the end. Brett Flehinger is one of my favorite course instructors!","This class provides a good background on the Vietnam War from both the American and Vietnamese perspectives, as well as the war's legacies and contemporary relevance.  I think the team-teaching approach is good, in principle, for a course like this.  However, Professor Tai's lectures, while very informative, were a bit dry at times.  Professor Flehinger's lectures were highly engaging but tended to be a little bit all-over-the-map.  Overall, the course could have been better in terms of organization and communication regarding assignments (the syllabus and website were not always up to date).","This class is absolutely awesome. Both professors are very knowledgeable and engaging, and the reading is very interesting. The TF was only okay - sections were a little awkward at times and her comments on my work weren't always that helpful, but overall you should DEFINITELY take the class.","Truly fantastic class taught by two amazing professors.  If you've ever been curious about the Vietnam War, take it.","Great class on the Vietnam War. This class is just as much on the Vietnamese experience as it is the American experience of the War. Understanding both helps you understand each individually on a deeper level.","If you need this for a history nonwestern requirement and are interested in America, this course focuses on both America and Vietnam, which is nice."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.20","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"3.10","recommendation":"4.30","enrollment":"17","response rate":"70.59","QCourseOverall":{"number":"HIST 1063","course_id":"2458","cat_num":"3447","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"2","4s":"5","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"HIST 1063","course_id":"2458","cat_num":"3447","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"11","4s":"1","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"HIST 1063","course_id":"2458","cat_num":"3447","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"4","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
