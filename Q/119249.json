Even if you're not interested in data management, there are some useful things you can pick up in 165.  It's also a fairly easy CS elective.","Great course. Great teacher.  You should take it. Compared to other computer science courses, workload is manageable.","The course will give you a very solid understanding of data management problems and design decisions. Professor Margo Seltzer is very friendly and creates a very collaborative discussion environment during lectures, which are a lot of fun. The course's final project is an excellent opportunity to find thesis topics. You can learn a tremendous amount from this course as long as you put in the effort in the assignments and pay attention to readings and lectures. It's one of the most rewarding classes I've taken in college.","The course matter is fairly interesting, but the problem sets were not especially valuable if you already had exposure to relational database problems.","It's a good course (caveat: by its nature, it holds less appeal for those whose interests lie outside systems). Prof. Seltzer is excellent.","Margo is a great professor that will make you understand the different ways to approach a problem. The course is all about picking the best possible solution for a problem among many different options, and the course teaches very well how to decide which the best solution is.","If you're new to CS, this might be a good class to take to get a better feel for the concentration. As a more experienced CS concentrator, you will be bored to death.","Margo is reason enough to take the class. But, read over the syllabus and make sure you understand what material the class is covering. Be sure that you're really interested in the guts of transactions and concurrency control, otherwise you're in for a really dull month in the middle.","It's a class about data management design. You will want to be comfortable designing things and arguing for that design and against alternative designs. It's not just about making things work. It's about doing it in a way that works best.","Asst 4 sucks","Margo is awesome!  Her enthusiasm turns what some might consider a boring topic into something quite interesting.  The knowledge gained is also invaluable for anyone planning on being a software developer.","Interesting perspective on different approaches to data management. Take it if you want to learn about different storage technologies people use and what's behind them.","Ambiguous questions galore.  Also, while some of the stuff you learn is nice to know, you don't walk away with any new skills.","It's a good, low workload, systems class with the opportunity for a fun final project.","This is the most practical computer science course I've taken as a computer science concentrator."]},"Spring '14":{"comments":["Very useful, and the ideas discussed are interesting, but the workload is INTENSE.","This class was in its first new form this year, being about Data Systems, not databases. That being said, if you want a class where there's a clear correct answer and follows a textbook religiously, this is NOT that class. Stratos is very big on the discussion and working together in the course. It was cool being able to take conversations about topics in lecture and continue them during Office Hours with him as he explained about what related research is going on with that.\r\n\r\nYou are expected to defend your reasons for why you built up your data system (all in C btw) in a certain way. And yeah you will be debugging for most of this class. So GDB and valgrind, and a lot of CS61 concepts will be your best friends if you choose to take this class. If that's in your wheelhouse you'll find this class quite rewarding. It's a really good feeling to go from 0 lines of code in March to a working data system that out performs MySQL in May!","This was a great class, we learned a bunch of stuff that's so new regarding databases and data systems that most of the industry doesn't even use it yet. Also Stratos is great, really down to earth and a great professor. That being said, the workload for this class was literally insane. We basically have to write a version of MySQL, a feat that led to some problem sets to require 80+ hours of coding and 2000+ lines. My final database was 4,500 thousand lines and took over 160 hours to put this in perspective. You will not sleep, especially if you take this concurrently with another Computer Science class; I regularly went to bed around 4:30, having made very little progress from the previous day.","Good if interested in building databases.  focus is no longer on basic database usage and concepts in software engineering.  Hopefully, the workload will be more manageable and better structured in future iterations of the course.  Stratos and the rest of the staff were highly invested and definitely want the course to succeed.","It is certainly a useful course, especially if you are interested in databases. Many topics (B+ Trees, different design paradigms) are pretty interesting as well. I felt the expectations of the course were somewhat unclear, and some of the material could be covered more clearly. The course workload was also heavily biased towards the start\/middle of the course, although the courseload will probably be smoothed out in subsequent offerings.","Very interesting course but definitely takes a lot of work","If you are interested in systems, design, big data and of course databases themselves, this is class is for you. It requires a lot of work but really helps you see the details of the most frontier issues. It was a bit unorganized at first since it's the first time it's offered and there were different expectations.","This is a difficult, work-intensive course, and whether you find such work to be worth it depends on what you're looking for as a programmer. I did not feel comfortable with systems, and hadn't really had to design and implement a large-scale project from scratch before, so I found the class to be a really good learning experience. Building up your own codebase and having to debug\/maintain it over the duration of the course is pretty difficult, but it also makes you really appreciate being able to work with a clean codebase. While the work you do outside of class is very implementation-based, the course itself focuses a lot on high-level design decisions (tradeoffs are everywhere!). DB cracking (Stratos's own research) is a pretty interesting topic, and it's pretty cool to see people creating algorithms for DBs that make intuitive sense (rather than it all being grounded in abstract theoretical math). The course + workload next year will likely more balanced, since Prof Stratos is receptive to feedback and will probably adjust things accordingly.","I think the assignments asked for too much--the assignments should have focused more on the actual database algorithms, as opposed to building all the glue in between (networking, rpc, threadpool, error handling, parsing, etc.). Because of this, I spent more time working on the glue than on the actual material in the class. I think this can be solved by giving some optional distribution code for the unrelated parts of the assignment so that students have more time to focus and optimize the database code.","This class was a bit of a mess this year (the first year its being run). The first assignment was way too time-consuming and not very instructive. It would have been better to have some distribution code, and have us build the more interesting parts of the assignment. Overall, the material is interesting, but the course was not very well run this year.","I absolutely, wholeheartedly loved 165!!!! That includes several late nights and OH with the awesome TFs and Stratos. This class made me think like a true computer scientist, increased my confidence in my coding skills, made me so proud for having built an awesome data system and inspired me to just look up cool things about databases on my own. A few words on Stratos. He is just the best. He is one of the nicest people I have met, devoted to make sure you LEARN rather than get a stupid grade and this just caused me to truly learn and appreciate the material. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I have learned more in any other class at Harvard. Please go to his office hours, he is super approachable and just a sweet person overall. Really excited and looking forward to taking CS265 with him in the fall. Harvard needs more professors like him to inspire students! Also, Mike, Peter and Rob are awesome :)\r\nOn the more practical side, you become really good with C, you understand how the memory hierarchy works, how databases are built, you build your own super modern column store database. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, I had no idea what a column store is and now I built a super fast one. \r\nPreReqs: CS61 is good but only because it exposes you to C. Other than that, CS61 concepts are not that important. Also, I think general CS maturity is necessary.\r\nTAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING AND BECOME A TRUE COMPUTER SCIENTIST!","Don't just hack together code; think carefully about how to design your system and organize your code into isolated components","The information presented in this class is interesting, but the class is going to need a lot of structural changes before I recommend it to friends. For an intro databases class, the assignments had too large scope and were too open-ended. We essentially built a small database system through the semester, and I spent over 40 hours on my system some weeks. Many of the assignments had us programming things that weren't core to an understanding of databases; having distribution code would have saved us many hours per week of unnecessary coding by allowing us to focus on implementing actual db concepts rather than just getting our system running. Feedback was also pretty poor this year, with comments\/ grades arriving very very occasionally; I'm sure that will get better in future years though when the problem sets get more streamlined.","This was the first year of this course, so it was kind of rocky. The overall assignment for the semester was to build a database system for storing integers, in C with no external libraries. This was quite challenging to do, but I learned a lot about system design and databases through this process. I imagine the course will be more effectively structured next year, but it is by no means an easy class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"3.80","workload":"4.30","difficulty":"4.10","recommendation":"3.70","enrollment":"34","response rate":"67.65","QCourseOverall":{"number":"COMPSCI 165","course_id":"1241","cat_num":"0560","1s":"1","2s":"0","3s":"8","4s":"5","5s":"7"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"COMPSCI 165","course_id":"1241","cat_num":"0560","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"4","4s":"8","5s":"8"},"QWorkload":{"number":"COMPSCI 165","course_id":"1241","cat_num":"0560","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"5","4s":"5","5s":"11"}},"success":true}
