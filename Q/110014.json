Very interesting. Thought-provoking.","If you are interested in ancient Mesopotamia at all take this class. Professor Barjamovic is very approachable and knowledgeable about the subject, and takes the time to answer questions and value student opinions. This course serves as a wonderful introduction to Mesopotamia if you have no experience in this field, but is also appropriate for students well versed in the subject. Overall, a very interesting and enjoyable class."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.80","workload":"2.30","difficulty":"2.80","recommendation":"5.00","enrollment":"7","response rate":"85.71","QCourseOverall":{"number":"ANE 103","course_id":"11046","cat_num":"65695","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"1","5s":"5"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"ANE 103","course_id":"11046","cat_num":"65695","1s":"0","2s":"1","3s":"5","4s":"0","5s":"0"},"QWorkload":{"number":"ANE 103","course_id":"11046","cat_num":"65695","1s":"0","2s":"4","3s":"2","4s":"0","5s":"0"}},"success":true}
