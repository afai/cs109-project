'07":{"comments":["This class is extremely difficult and I would take it only if you have sufficient experience with theoretical math and at least 10 hours per week to complete problem sets.","If you need a math class, this is a good one, but it can be very confusing at times.  Also, it's not as elegant as some other math courses, though it is more applicable.","This class is very challenging. For applied math concentrators, there are certainly many easier ways to fulfill the analysis requirement. However, the concepts taught in optimization are more relevant to application in economics than those covered in other classes.","The class is pretty good and not particularly difficult.  If you want to learn a lot about optimization you would probably be better served by taking a grad class at MIT assuming you have the time to throw at it.","They should not miss the chance of taking a special course like this one.","As long as you're ready for a bumpy ride with Paul (who hopefully will continue to polish this though) and working through some hardcore math... get ready for one astonishing ride through the powerful world of math to solve problems and questions in the world we live in! If all permits, I would love to take the course again perhaps with more apt preparation so maybe I'll run into some of you =).","It's quite fun and relatively painless. Don't take it as a blowoff though, it takes a decent amoutn of work.","It's hard (if you aren't a math concentrator), time demanding, and maybe not immediately useful for applications. But it's worth it.","It covers really cool topics and appears as though it will really be useful in my future, which I think is awesome.","The problem sets were of highly varied difficulty; at times I finished a problem set in under an hour; at other times I spent over ten hours piecing together seemingly abstract concepts, just to find an actual application to a deviously simple two-variable problem.","take applied math 121 if you're interested in economics, scientific computing, etc."]},"Fall '08":{"comments":["Some portions of this course are useful for econ\/engineering types, but though the exams are largely applications the content tends toward the theoretical.  The class is hard and time consuming and not an easy way to fulfill the analysis requirement or the math secondary field.","The homework is incredibly time consuming, and the material isn't taught in an incredibly interesting way from a theoretical mathematical perspective.","Excellent course with good mix of theoretical and applied material. Problem sets are well-designed, the professor's lecture notes are helpful, and the professor himself is one of the best I've had at Harvard - not only is he enthusiastic about the material, but he also tries to make things easier for students (e.g. setting the class time so that it is more convenient for Extension students, giving us the choice between quizzes and a midterm, etc.).","Make sure you will make a strong commitment and dedication, both time and energy, before decide to this course","Don't let the first weeks of the class fool you.  The material gets very difficult very quickly after you have already committed to taking the class.  Also, it's very easy to not know what the heck you are learning has to do with optimization.  The first half of the class seems just like any other math class, but the last half finally uses that stuff to solve problems.  It's just hard to lose sight of the purpose of the class.","More work than it appears, and not particularly rewarding.","very difficult, students must be willing to work hard","This is class is interesting but challenging. If you are diligent and have a mathematically-oriented mind, this course is probably reasonable for you."]},"Fall '09":{"comments":["This is a great class to take if you want a view into some applications of the more abstract things that you learn in upper-level mathematics classes. While the math does get advanced, it doesn't get too in-depth, with more emphasis on the applications.","Long homeworks."]},"Fall '10":{"comments":["Be ready for a VERY heavy workload.  For me, what I think makes or breaks the class is the quality of the TAs - without their help I would have been totally lost.  Make sure you take advantage of them.","Take AM121 unless you are interested in theory.","It's a hard class, no doubt about it.  Interesting, though, and well-taught.  I would recommend it if you're in a more applied field, but you're still interested in the pure\/proof side of things.","This class skims the surface of a lot of material but does not leave you with a big-picture understanding of the concepts. Most of the class is devoted to contrived examples which can be solved with single-variable calculus in the first place. The workload is heavy; the payoff is light.","Brilliant course with great material but make sure you take the extra time outside of class to really understand the material each week because it builds fast","Many, many assignments. However, knowledge of the optimization problems we solved promises to be very useful.","Pretty useful class.  Definitely spend time reading Luenberger.  It's very easy to just rely on the class notes, but if you go through the book yourself, you gain a much better understanding of what's going on.  Homeworks can be annoying but they are tolerable (wish that the homeworks would at least be weighted more given how much effort we put into them).  Quizzes and final are very reasonable.","It is a challenging but fun and rewarding class.","This semester's class definitely had some structural issues (i.e. we didn't finish on time, had extra classes, and two full length problem sets due during reading period) However, the material was interesting  (but often incredibly difficult) and aside from that, well structured. \r\nFor Math 23 students considering 116:   The class is doable. But 23 and 116 aren't really comparable. The material is more difficult, and the psets more time consuming (especially since we have less proof experience than those in 25\/55)","the class is not extremely difficult. The hard part is to understand the methods after that is very much the same and it may make the class boring - i.e. you either know how to do it or you don't know.","This course will come to *define* how you think about optimization problems, and it's completely rigorous.  It takes some work, especially toward the beginning, but it's completely worth it.","It teaches a decent mix of theory and applications. But be warned, the P-sets are pretty hard."]},"Fall '11":{"comments":["This is really a cool class in which you get to both learn new theoretical concepts and get to see them in action as they are applied to optimization problems. Paul really cares about his students, and it's just an overall fun mathematical experience. Note for students who are coming from Math 23, this class is more difficult and more time consuming.","Overall, it was a great class. Be prepared to work hard though, as the problem sets are labor intensive. Paul is enthusiastic about the material, and if you keep an open mind, it can be contagious.","Having a problem set per week is a good amount of work. It is easy when taking this class to feel as if you're doing problems that are seemingly useless. The course has a tendency to miss the forrest for the trees. But with some effort from reading the textbook, the course has the potential to help you think more broadly about what optimization actually is.","It's an interesting class that tries to present the connections among many different ways of optimization. Worth the time to think about the all the problems and develop the ability to synthesize.","Problem sets are hard. I put a couple of nights into them, went to section, and still had a near-weekly struggle to finish them. That said, the course is graded really fairly, and tests are very, very manageable. It's a hard course, but one where you can do well."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Even if you don't have the requirements, you can definitely take the course as long as you are willing to work hard and put in a lot of time.","It certainly adds much to your understanding of almost all aspects of mathematics from real analysis to calculus of variations.","This is a class where you might be left alone a little bit, so be prepared to motivate yourself to really learn the material - it's definitely possible, though the material is difficult sometimes - but what makes the course hard is that you sometimes have to teach yourself.","This is a great class, which I'd highly recommend. The one caveat is that there's quite a bit of homework, and the problem sets are usually long. If you can power through them, though, you'll get a lot out of this course. Paul's a great lecturer.","Extremely interesting material. A bit old-fashioned, but you will learn about optimization in a very useful way.","Paul is always entertaining with his stories, and his notes make the material more digestible. Dan was helpful and always available with office hours and sections. Definitely take it if it is with Paul and Dan","Challenging course, but well worth it","This course is a solid, interesting and rigorous introduction to a difficult subject in functional analysis. The Luenberger textbook is great, and the course will train you to think much more precisely about vector spaces.\r\n\r\nIt is not strictly necessary for Economics 2010a, however (despite being listed as such).","The class isn't well organized. We had two psets due during reading period, one of which was due the day before the final. So a good portion of your reading\/finals period will be learning new material from this class as well as reviewing for it. \r\n\r\nOther than that, the work during the semester isn't too onerous and I did like the mix of theory and application of functional analysis, although the course did shift to the computational side later on in the semester.","The material of this class ranges from trivial to very difficult. Be sure to stay on top of it as the beginning of the course is not representative of the difficulty by the end.","If Daniel Cooney is the CA, you will have a fantastic learning experience.  Daniel is truly dedicated, and his teaching style is wholeheartedly synergistic with that of Paul Bamberg.  Daniel's energy, intellect, and teaching acumen, in combination with the brilliant and lucid lectures given by Paul, combine to form a math course which is a true gem in the department."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["Preview the notes and read the book, go to class, review the notes, do problem sets, and you will learn tons.","You know what you're going to get with a Bamberg class. His regimented teaching formula works very well with this material though. It's challenging and hard to wrap your head around and there are times when you have to just trust him that all the functional analysis will eventually lead to applications, but there is always a light waiting at the end of the tunnel. Also TF is smoking hot","This class is difficult, especially since my background wasn't great (I had taken a proof-based class, but it was much easier than something like Math 23). Paul is engaging and usually clear enough to follow. The homework problems vary in difficulty, with several problems repeating what you did in class but occasional problems that are much more difficult than anything from class. Memorizing proofs is annoying since I don't think it will help me produce proofs on my own. The methods you learn are theoretically very useful, but the problems we see still need to be \"cooked up\" to be simple enough to solve - and at that point single-variable calculus would often do just as well.","Great class.  You will learn a lot, and yet it never seems all that difficult because of Paul's teaching.  Sometimes not the most fascinating topics, but they are important and Paul teaches in a way that makes it easy."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"3.10","difficulty":"3.30","recommendation":"4.40","enrollment":"8","response rate":"87.50","QCourseOverall":{"number":"MATH 116","course_id":"2855","cat_num":"5253","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"0","4s":"3","5s":"4"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"MATH 116","course_id":"2855","cat_num":"5253","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"2","4s":"2","5s":"1"},"QWorkload":{"number":"MATH 116","course_id":"2855","cat_num":"5253","1s":"0","2s":"2","3s":"3","4s":"1","5s":"1"}},"success":true}
