Stick to it, study hard, and do the supplementary exercises. Plus, the long trek to Vanserg is a great time to bond with your classmates, and I have become good friends with many of the other students in my section.","This class will be quite challenging.

The course is so much fun and the teachers are hilarious. You'll end up coming out of it learning a ton and having fun while you're doing it.","If you want to learn Chinese, there is no better way. But brace yourself for the ride.","I would recommend it, but only to students very interested in Chinese with a relatively light courseload for that semester. (Do not take it with 5 classes, as I did).","Chinese BA is very difficult for the first 6-8 weeks.Then it becomes better, but the workload never decreases and the intensity does not let up.This course was the reason I stayed up till 3 am most nights. The lecturer and the TF's are amazing! By far the best I have experienced, but the pace and workload negate that, so much so that it possible to completely lose ones passion for the language. Do not take this as a freshman ( your schedule will just be too intense) and do not take this unless you have a definite unwavering passion for Chinese.","It is a lot of work but manageable.","This class is REALLY time consuming.","It's definitely a LOT of work, especially at the beginning, but the teachers make it fun and the work isn't too hard, so it's not that bad.  Expect to take 1-2 hours or so a day studying characters.  Concerning work load, memorizing characters took the most time, but speaking isn't as hard and overall it's pretty enjoyable.  Definitely my favorite class this semester.","If you are new to Asian languages, then only take the course if you are willing to put in time daily.","Be prepared to work hard if you want to make the most of this course. If you are enthusiastic, you will have a brilliant time. The teachers are excellent and drill sections are always a giggle. Go for it!","I have not had more dedicated, hardworking, and funny teachers in any other class.  If you want to learn Chinese, and are willing to put in the time, this class can be amazing.  If you do the work, you will learn an impressive amount of Chinese and will probably get a good grade.  Also, the head lecturer, Wang laoshi, is HYSTERICAL.","This class is amazing. It's a little painful in the beginning, but it definitely gets better over time (especially getting used to the tones and memorizing characters). The exams are fair. As long as you study, you should be able to do well. If you want to learn Chinese and have no previous experience, definitely begin with this course.","The teacher's are extremely resourceful - you just have to want to learn the language.  They've made it incredibly accessible through extra practice exercises, office hours, and individual drill sections.","Make the effort to learn all the characters. Make flashcards if necessary. Do not allow yourself to put off practicing Chinese as you will get left behind.","Its a good class if you want to work hard and learn alot","Try to take the placement exams for any other foreign languages that you might know anyways even if you're thinking of taking this to fulfill the language requirement. Take the placement exam for Chinese if you have any exposure at all--and yes, that includes if you're ethnically Chinese and your parents speak a dialect at all. \r\nMost importantly: Learn enough Chinese so that you can be placed into Chinese Ba instead of trying to start this as a new language or as a new dialect. If possible, also know how to read and write Japanese and\/or Korean. Also, if there's any reason you might not want to take this class, shop it. If there's still any doubt, don't take the class. If you can't keep up in this class during shopping period, you'll fall behind in this and the rest of your classes if you try to do well in this. Plus, you'll still be having trouble in Chinese.","You will have a great time learning the Chinese language! Although it sounds daunting at first, it is a lot of fun and you will see yourself improving in no time!","The instructors are fantastic and they make learning Chinese enjoyable (even if the language itself has so many difficult characters).","Having to do a significant account of work every night for the class becomes tedious. Make sure you really want to learn Chinese.","This is a great introduction to Chinese. It is hard and will take up a great deal of time, but it is SO worth it. The teachers are fantastic and really care. You will see so much progress in your skills and get to know a group of other very dedicated students weel.","Even if you're only the slightest bit interested in Chinese, TAKE this class. You won't regret it. Promise.","I would highly recommend this course to those willing to work hard. The class is rather time consuming but certainly worth the investment. The best past of the course is the teaching staff. They are extremely funny, engaging, and even stylish!","Wang laoshi is AMAZING!!!","This is a great class. You will need to study a little every day, but after three months, you will be able to speak Chinese.","This is one of the best language courses at Harvard.  The teaching staff are phenomenal, and if you put in the work you will see significant results!  Yet, it is important to realize, especially if you are an incoming freshman, that this is a very challenging course-- you'll be spending a good 2-3 hours on it everyday.  This shouldn't be a turn-off, but just make sure that it fits in well with the rest of your schedule, and that once you start classes that you reach out to the teachers ASAP if you start falling behind or struggling.  With that, I encourage everyone who is interested in Chinese to consider taking it!  The amount of dedication and passion seen from both students and teachers is inspiring.","It gets harder every week, and you will fall behind if you slack off for even a little bit.","it's hard work, but if you want to learn Chinese, it's a great course to take.","Be ready to work.","They teach you Chinese extremely well! I feel like I know the language a lot more even though I took three years in high school.  Definitely one of the most useful classes where I actually learn that I have ever taken.","needs about 15-20 hours a week.","Good, and you'll learn, but if you don't have at least 3 hours a day to spend on it then you will not do as well as you'd like. Extraordinarily time-consuming.","Best class I took this semester: great teachers, lots of personal attention, well worth the time. The progress I've made is amazing.","Be prepared to work! The work will definitely pay off though.","You should be expecting and ready to spend \"decent\" amount of time for this course.","This course gets a lot of hype for being difficult, but honestly if you just set aside a few hours a day to do the work and repetitiously speak\/write the vocabulary, it is totally manageable and quite rewarding.","Don't get behind - it's ridiculously annoying to catch up on even a day's worth of work.","It is A LOT of work! Only take it if you are serious about continuing your study of the Chinese language.","It is very, very hard work, but the work pays off.  The class is really fun, and if you work hard you will see the rewards in your speech.","you need to put much effort and time into this course. don't be discouraged in the first few weeks because you need some time to get adjusted to the massive amount of work.","you should be ready to be challenged!:) but it'll be fun!","It's a spectacular course that truly rewards hard work and persistence.","hard, but worth it.  I feel culturally enlightened","This course is really tough but the amount that you learn makes it worth it.  The instructors are both great teachers and caring people who all know you by name (although it will be your Chinese name, of course!).","If you've ever wanted to learn Chinese (which you should) you should take this class. It will challenge you; the workload is staggering at times. I remember one day, when I did all the optional assignments, that I spent literally 6 hours on this class. \r\n\r\nProfessor Wang, who does the lectures, is engaging and hilarious. I enjoyed going to lecture immensely. The section leaders are critical, sometimes in non-constructive ways; however, this is a Chinese cultural difference. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to work a lot. It will take at least an hour or 2 (most times 2-3) nightly. However, you will learn so much.","Perhaps the best language course I have ever attended (I studied 4 languages in 4 different countries) but be prepared for a lot of work. A perfect way to channel your productivity.","this course, while not terribly difficult, is a fair amount of work. But the reward-- a basic understanding of written and spoken Chinese-- outweighs any late nights that you may spend recording dictation homework or studying characters.","It does get a bit easier after the first month, but be prepared to work hard throughout the entire term.","I would recommend this course to anyone who a) wants to learn Chinese, or b) wants to learn a completely different language in general. While the work may be tough, and the language completely different from English, it's rewarding in the end. However, you need to be aware what you would be getting into: the course is fast-paced, yet filled with content.","You will learn a lot of Chinese, but you will work hard.","It's a character building course. You'll not only learn to speak Chinese but also to be happy in times of crisis and to make friends out of suffocation. At the end, you'll be so happy you took the course because you were happily suffering for your own good."]},"Fall '12":{"comments":["Chinese Ba is so much fun. The teaching staff is incredible and the language itself is so interesting and fun to learn. . It was one of my favorite classes this year. Take Chinese Ba!","This class was fantastic. All the teachers are very enthusiastic and helpful. Both lectures and drill sections are very, very well structured.","Just make sure you keep up with the work, make full use of all materials offered, and you will really enjoy this course.","This was one of my favorite classes I took this semester. I learned so much that it's actually incredible to look back and realize that before this semester I didn't know any Chinese at all. The teachers are great and section is really helpful; you get a lot of personal attention. That being said, don't take this class unless you are willing to put in a lot of time. There is a lot of vocabulary and grammar to memorize and to do well, you have to consistently be putting in a considerable amount of work. It's not really difficult, just a lot of hours and effort. Totally worth it though!","It is one of the best language classes I have ever taken. But beware: Bring time and a high frustration tolerance! It is not easy.","The Chinese language program is AMAZING. There is so much help available, the office hours are every day, you see the teachers everyday, and the teachers are so friendly.","Practice as much as you can. The more you practice, the more amazing you will be at speaking and writing. Seriously.","It's definitely a lot of work. You have two dictations - short vocabulary quizzes - and at least one homework assignment each week, and you will be expected to be prepared to work with new material during each section. BUT, the teachers are absolutely fantastic - just incredibly nice, helpful, and good, enjoyable people to be around in general - and you really learn a ton of material very quickly. Worth it both if you want to just get the language requirement out of the way or if you want to get a citation in Chinese.","This is an excellent class for anyone interested in learning Chinese. It's not easy. It takes time to get used to tones, practice speaking, and memorize characters, but it is more than worth it. There are dictations twice a week and it can be hard to be prepared for every one, but even if you aren't, they help you keep up with course material. All of the teachers are wonderful, extremely approachable, and helpful.","For students who have never taken Chinese before and are totally unfamiliar with the language, the course is very fast paced, especially at the beginning. You have to be ready to hit the ground running and expect that not everyone in the class is a real beginner.","For those with no experience with an Asian language whatsoever, this will be a very hard, fast-paced, time consuming course. That said, if you have even the tiniest bit of experience, it should be much easier.","Only take this course if you are very certain you want to learn Chinese. It requires time and effort and will be harder than you expected, so you really have to want it. But they are very, very good at teaching the language to you if you do!","Very difficult class. Be prepared to put an extraordinary amount of time just to get by, let alone do well.","This is a great class! Sun laoshi and the drill session leaders are really great. They're understanding and there to help you.","While this class is rewarding and extremely well-taught, I recommend that you are aware of the intense time commitment the class requires.","This course is the best. The teachers are so hilarious and they make Chinese very fun. My Chinese has improved so much because we speak Chinese everyday. The small sections help students to practice what they learned in lecture and to get to know other students. I feel that my Chinese section is like a family to me.","This class is a quick and strong way of learning the Chinese language, meeting daily to enforce an efficient curriculum that will optimize students exposure to the Chinese language.","This class keeps you busy all throughout the week. There are two quizzes, character sheets, exercise sheets, and a recording due every week, so be prepared to set aside enough time to finish everything. On average you're learning 30 characters a week also, so it takes some review to remember past vocabulary. Overall it's a fun class and you feel very accomplished learning so much material.","This course will be very time consuming. It is not that difficult but you have homework multiple times a week and it moves at a fast pace. Make sure you have the time to put in to get the most out of this course.","This class was great! It is amazing how much you learn in just a semester going from not being able to identify a single character to having conversations completely in Chinese. It goes very quickly and you absolutely have to be on top of things (with there being daily class and biweekly dictations) but its quite rewarding. It's a lot of work though so take it only if you know this is something you absolutely want to pursue. Plus it's actually awesome when you realize you can start to pick up bits and pieces of the tourists' conversations in the yard :)","be prepared to learn traditional characters!","This is a great opportunity to learn a great language. Chinese is extremely difficulty but also very fun to learn. You definitely won't regret taking this class.","The teachers and program are excellent-if you are interested in learning Chinese sometime or other, this course is a great place to start. It is not a gratuitously easy course, but as long as you put the effort in every day, you will do well. I highly recommend it.","This class takes a lot of time if you don't have experience. Many of your peers taking the class will have had 2+ years of experience with the language.","If you want to learn Chinese, take this course. If you want to learn a foreign language well, take this course. Harvard is known for its Chinese program. It's hard, it's challenging, but it all pays off.","This language course is very well designed. Lecture is only twice a week - the other three days are spent in section with a small group. Both the lecture and section leaders rotate, so you get to learn from a ton of different professors - there's no chance of being stuck with someone you don't like (and the professors are great, seriously). The variety of assignments also gives a very comprehensive education - recordings and individual sessions help improve pronunciation while written homework helps grammar, writing, and listening. The teachers are very invested in students' success, all you have to do is put the time in and take advantage of the multitude of opportunities they offer.","This class is amazing. If you think you want to learn Chinese this is the place to do it. I could not imagine a better course staff than Chinese Ba they are all so nice and fun. You will learn so much while feeling like you're just having a good time.","This course was just fantastic! It is UNBELIEVABLE how much progress you make in this class! This was my first and only college level language class and it blew my mind-it doesnt even compare to language classes you take in high school because you make so much progress so so so fast. the teachers are fantastic and while the course does require commitment on your part-dont be scared off it by the workload, its definitely manageable! also, the instructors are fabulous!","The memorization of characters is the hardest part","It is very fun, rewarding and effective! You will not believe how much you can speak within 2 months!","If you want a strong and thorough introduction to Mandarin Chinese, this is certainly the class to take! The teaching staff is phenomenal -- all of them are incredibly dedicated and go out of their way to make themselves available. Section is also super educational and fun. Note, however, that it is a fast-paced course, and you have to be ready to work every night. Character memorization for dictation takes lots of time, as does the weekly homework.  Still, I give this class my highest recommendation!","The teachers are incredibly enthusiastic and extremely eager to help their students learn. Their dedication is very apparent. Excellent class--great experience overall.","Chinese BA is by far the most fun class I've taken at Harvard. However, be aware that you'll need to put in the effort and time outside of class to keep up with the characters since we learn about 50 new vocabulary words a week. If you're serious about learning Chinese, take this class!","This class is taught amazingly well. The teachers are friendly and helpful (office hours are perfect opportunities for one-on-one practice). Sections are engaging and lectures are fun. However, fall behind a day or two and you'll start dreading class, because (at least in my section) your peers and the teacher keep up the pace. So, practice everyday. Actually. By the end you'll be able to at least write more than many Chinese-Americans your age.","This course is excellent! I highly recommend it to those interested in Chinese. Although it is a larger time commitment because of 5 classes a week, if you have a genuine interest in the topic you will find it very enjoyable. While there are a lot of commitments and quizzes in this class, it becomes fairly routine so you aren't stressed out by each one. The teachers are superb - funny and friendly. And if you chose a section with a good group of people, you'll end up looking forward to class everyday. Lots of resources provided to help you learn and just an overall great course.","If you feel that learning Chinese is something you really would like to do in your lifetime - now is your perfect opportunity! This class certainly will give you one of the most useful skills you could learn as an undergraduate - a foreign language.","The teachers are great. Their english is perfect. The classes are all very fun (we laugh a lot), but get ready to study.","I would tell them that this class is a lot of work, but it's also very rewarding. You will definitely come out of the class being able to speak some Chinese!","Definitely know that you are coming into this class to work really hard and put a lot of time into this. You won't be able to miss lectures and then cram everything the night before the exam.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the class. However, it is very rewarding.","This is truly a phenomenal class. Every teacher is excellent and you'll be surprised by how much Chinese you can read and speak at the end of one semester. Be prepared to put in a significant amount of time into the course, especially if you have no prior experience with Chinese. But don't worry. Lots of people are in the same boat as you are.","This class is really fun. Chinese is a very cool language, and other people will be impressed that you are learning it. With that being said, it definitely isn't the easiest language out there. If you are simply looking for the easiest way to fulfill your language requirement, look elsewhere. Don't let me scare you out of taking it. This class is very doable, and all of the instructors are nice and understanding. They don't grade too harshly, and they make jokes during class. I would highly recommend this class to everyone. You learn so much in such a short period of time, and you feel good about yourself when you are doing things right.","Very fun and different from other classes","The expectations are at times unreasonable given the pace (particularly near the end) and you have to really make sure you have few other obligations.","Take it! The professors and section leaders are awesome, nice, and really help you learn Chinese.  I'm a senior with no reason to take this, and I still loved every moment!","Take it! You quite possibly will never have another chance to learn a new language, and Mandarin is extremely useful and interesting. (The class is also taught extremely well.)","Be aware that this class will take up a lot of your time.  Much more than you would expect.","This course is extremely time consuming: I would say that is the most negative thing I can say about this class. It is often hard to keep up with the material, but if you put your time and effort into it, then the class is worth your while, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn a new language that is becoming more and more important at the world stage. In other words, the class is hard in that it is time consuming like any language class, but if you are prepared to put in the time, by the end you will already know common expressions and how to both write and speak basic Mandarin.","I took this class to clear my language requirement, but it ended up being my favorite class. I'm so glad I took it!","This course will require a lot of time but in the end you do learn a substantial amount of Chinese. It'll take time to get used to studying so many characters every week","This course is an absolutely fantastic way to be introduced to Chinese. The teachers make this course marvelous and the weekly dictations will keep you on your toes at all times. I wholeheartedly recommend this course if you want to learn Chinese. The class are lively and well-taught and having a section you love makes it even better.","It takes a lot of work, but if you have time it is definitely a class worth taking.","A pretty fast paced class, but leaves you with a conversational understanding of Chinese.","Take it! You won't regret it!!!","If you, like me, are looking for a course that is different than all your typical pset or reading heavy courses, this is for you. It is a ton of work, but really fun and interesting, and a great break from other types of work.","This class is fantastic. It was definitely my favorite class this semester. The teachers are all very enthusiastic about and dedicated to teaching the course, and by the end of the semester, you learn a surprising amount of Chinese (over 400 characters and quite a bit of grammar).","This is an absolutely fantastic class. Every single teacher is amazing-- and I definitely cannot say that for most other classes I've taken. It's a rigorous course, so be ready to work hard, but by the end of the semester you realize you've learned so much. Definitely take time to learn radicals. It's a time investment, but it makes studying so much easier.","Just take it. Superbly taught.","Get ready to spend a lot of time studying. It's a great course, Chinese is an important language, and its very well taught, but it demands out of you and could be difficult to handle with a large courseload.","a little chinese background can be really helpful. the class tends to move quite fast. there's dictations (aural quizzes) every tuesday and thursday on the new vocab (they pick about 5 from a list of maybe 20-30 words). chinese is a substantial time commitment but you really learn a lot.","This class is intense. It is very difficult and you will learn traditional characters (rather than simplified) so it can be a pain. However, the payoff is remarkable.","You will learn a lot whether you want to or not. This course somewhat assumes that you don't have any other work on your plate. In other words, you'll be spending 2-3 hours a night learning for the vocabulary\/grammar quizzes, plus huge, comprehensive reviews for the exams. None of this will be a waste of time, as it will actually and effectively cement the language in your mind. Just be prepared to put Chinese at the center of your life all term long.","Definitely take this language if you get the chance--the teachers are all wonderful and extremely nice. Grading is very fair--the consistent homework and dictations\/quizzes help keep students on track (this alleviates a lot of cramming). Everyone in my section has a ton of fun in class!","It's a great class to take, but you have to be ready to put in a lot of time. Even if it comes naturally, it is a lot of character memorizing each night, and if you struggle with it, it can become a nightmare.","You'll learn more in a semester of this class than you ever could have imagined. The professors are funny, accessible, and excellent teachers. However, if you're a beginner and want to succeed, this class is very time consuming. I would only recommend taking it if you can commit more than ten hours a week (outside of class).","It's hard work, but if you are committed, you can guarantee that you will learn the language pretty quickly.","This class is an engaging introduction to Chinese language and culture. Be sure to take advantage of office hours! The instructors are such a fantastic resource.","This course was a great way to start learning Chinese, and much of our vocab revolves around life at Harvard. Be prepared for a lot of studying though.","This is an excellent course if you are prepared to do the work outside of class. It is difficult and a lot of work but you will learn a lot.","This class and its teachers are fantastic. You should definitely take it! You get to learn a lot of Chinese and the class is really fun.","its a huge time committment","You have to have a thick skin to take Chinese Ba. The teachers are very enthusiastic and open to answering questions; however, there is a lot of time involved in studying for Dictation twice a week and completing the weekly homework of character sheets, exercises, and audio recordings. Plus every other week you have individual sessions with a teacher and do a mini oral presentation. \r\n\r\nI have learned a lot, but it wasn't easy - especially initially. I remember feeling completely overwhelmed and like, \"How in the world am I supposed to memorize and write so many of these random marks in such a short period of time?\" It was completely foreign. \r\n\r\nEven though it was tough particularly in the beginning, I'm proud to have completed the course and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the teachers and other students in my drill section. I plan on continuing Chinese, but I now understand the workload that comes with it (especially since I'm premed and this is not my main focus - already finished the language requirement and I'm only doing it for my personal knowledge). Overall, I think it's worth it though.","You'll work hard, you'll curse the Chinese department at times, but at the end of the day you'll learn more Chinese in semester than you ever could have imagined.","While this class is definitely difficult, it is very rewarding. You need to spend a lot of time reviewing characters and it can get frustrating, but in the end you'll be surprised by how much you learn. If you are interested in learning Chinese, don't be afraid to take the class because you think it might be hard. While there is a time commitment, the teachers are always ready to help you. My only complaint is that we have to learn traditional, while it would make more sense to learn simplified.","I would recommend this class to future students. It's extremely fun and interactive. The teachers are also very good.","Chinese is a really difficult language to learn and is very confusing. However, the instructors are fantastic and really want you to do well so that makes it a bit less stressful. The accent is really hard to get down, but if you talk like a stereotypical japanese shogun you apparently can sound pretty legit."]},"Fall '13":{"comments":["It's a lot of work but it's fun and you will learn a lot of Chinese in very little time.","It is definitely an intensive course, but worth the effort.

Don't be intimidated by the difficulty of learning Chinese, this class is excellent.","The teachers for this course are wonderful--they're always willing to help you work on tones or pronunciation or just to explain the meaning behind certain words or grammar structures.

If class five days a week wasn't enough for you, the weekly grammar homework, character sheets, audio recording, and vocab quizzes pile up. That being said, if you're interested in learning Chinese and putting in the work, this class has amazing results. All of the Chinese teachers are incredibly helpful and funny, and class is always fun.","i just love, love, love this course! the language is already incredibly interesting and useful, but the teaching staff made the semester a delight. sun and zhou laoshi make lecture go very smoothly and dispense the language is a very easy-to-understand manner. the drill section leaders are all incredibly good at what they do and i liked each and every one of them. yes, you have to do a lot of homework and put in a lot of time, but it is worth it!","I would like to tell future students to study vocabulary as you go along because it will help you a lot in the long run and save you time on every homework. There is a lot of work in this class so unless you really want to take Chinese I would not recommend it.

Super enjoyable, especially in section, but you're gonna have constant pressure to keep up with everyone. That being said, if you study and do your flashcards or whatever, you'll be golden on the (biweekly) assessments, which constitute the majority of work required. Take this class.","Extremely tough; you have to REALY want to learn Chinese. I did, but got behind due to some problems...once that happened there was no catching back up.

It's certainly an intensive introduction to the language, but well-worth it.","This is an amazing class for whoever intends to speak, read and write Chinese.

You will learn in all areas much more quickly than you think - it's been fantastic to see how much I can do now compared to when I began.","I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Chinese, but I would warn you that you really need to pay attention in lecture from the start and make sure you are following the course requirements from the start. The class is extremely fast paced and it can often feel like you are being left behind if you don't make yourself stick to the schedule.","This is by far the best course I've taken here! The Chinese department is simply brilliant! I enjoyed every moment of Chinese class and also learned a lot! After just one semester I'm on the road to fluency. I'm not as lost in Boston's Chinatown as I was before and I can string together basic sentences in Chinese. I can also sort of fish out what people are saying in Chinese. The teachers are really good and fun-loving and I've gotten really close with my section. So much so that we don't even know each other's English names anymore! This is easily one of the best courses at Harvard. If you're considering it, stop hesitating and take it! I promise you won't regret it!","It's a lot of fun, but a lot of work","Amazing course, probably the best place to learn Chinese in the world.","This class is worth it if you are willing to put in time every day.","If you are not willing to put in the time to learn in this intensive Chinese program, look elsewhere. If you give yourself to the program, you will learn so much! It's definitely challenging, even frustrating at times, but my Chinese is SO much better for the time and energy I and the Chinese Ba staff have invested in the program.","This class is AMAZING!! Sun Laoshi is a VERY effective lecturer and the rest of the teaching staff is also VERY good. This class is very time consuming and can get quite difficult, but you WILL learn a lot. Best language class I've taken at Harvard.","Chinese Ba is a great course to explore for students interesting in both Chinese language and culture. The course requires a lot of dedication and outside preparation for class, but it is also incredibly rewarding. The Chinese department fosters a great sense of community I've yet to experience in other classes--students become close with students in their section through collaborative exercises and outside studying time.","If you haven't taken Mandarin before expect to spend 2-3 hours studying for every hour in class.  You should also consider making private investments in complementary grammar guides or dictionary software applications because it can take a very long time to search through the text for certain words or characters.  Office hours are a help but it is best to attend with a Ba instructor because the other Chinese instructors may not know what you have learned and won't be able to offer as appropriate advice as would a Ba instructor.","A great class. Make sure you are committed and will spend time learning all the stuff they throw at you, or you will flounder. But if you do the work, you'll learn an incredible amount. The entire teaching staff seems really dedicated. They know all the student's names, strengths, weaknesses, etc. All lectures and drill sessions are impeccably organized and designed to maximize the amount of time spent using the words you're learning. It's fun, challenging, and you'll learn a ton.","Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying. The class itself is incredibly fun and you will learn a ridiculous amount, but you're definitely going to have to work.","Chinese Ba is an excellent class, and I would highly recommend it.","If you really want to learn Chinese, this class is great. I can read and speak to native speakers and they all say how great I speak and how much we learn. It can be intense and at times very difficult, but in the end it is worth it. As long as you put in the work, you will learn Chinese, not to mention that the teachers will be there to help you along the way.","Take this class only if you are serious about wanting to learn Chinese. The work is heavy and difficult, but you learn so much. You have class every day which is time-consuming and sometimes inconvenient, especially since the building is so far away from all of the dorms!\r\nI appreciate how the class is very organized and what you have to do for good marks is very clear. The pace is very fast, you memorize about 50 words per week and more than 4 grammar usages. You have vocabulary quizzes twice a week. Don't be deceived by the three page homework packet, it will take you hours. But in the end it's all worth it! I absolutely love all of the teachers! This is my favorite class by far.\r\nGo to office hours! The teacher makes you tea!","I've never been more excited about learning a difficult language!","Ba is not a particularly difficult class at all. In fact, if you like languages enough to be okay with spending a few hours a week memorizing characters, then it's pretty easy. What's more important is how rewarding it is. I'm always so excited when I look at a page of characters that look so foreign and realised I can completely understand it and could probably read it out loud (although my accent still isn't great). The teaching staff are all wonderful, too. I learnt a lot more chinese than I was expecting to learn. Great language to take!","Chinese is hard, take it if you're actually interested but if you've never been exposed to it at all, you're going to be doing a lot of work to keep up with the pace","Beware that Chinese ba is intense.","do the work, and you will love the class","Chinese is more work than any of my other classes (maybe even combined), but it was by far the most rewarding and enjoyable class this semester.","Great course! Very challenging, but totally worth the effort. I came out of this class every day feeling excited about learning Chinese. The teachers are animated and helpful, and the coursework is never pointless. If you've ever thought about taking Chinese, consider this class.","The class is demanding, and you really need to make time for it every single day because the material is cumulative. It's extremely rewarding, though; I learned so much in one semester.","If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the place to do it. It'll be time consuming, but they are very supportive and want you to succeed. You'll feel like you're succeeding quickly, so just find a good routine and stick to it. Make sure you learn the foundations such as pronunciation and tones perfectly; it makes things so much easier in the end. This class has been so fun and I got so much out of it, all of the time spent was worth it.","Get ready to do a whole lot of work. This was the most difficult class I have ever taken. However, it was also the most interesting and exciting class I have ever taken. The characters are the most difficult, especially the writing, but, in the end, you will not regret taking this class.","This is class is extremely difficult, but so incredibly rewarding. You will be able to speak Chinese. That's CRAZY.","You must have interest in learning the Chinese language. Not just some curiosity but a real interest.","if you want to learn Chinese, then take this course and put weekly effort into it. Even though you will feel overwhelmed, stick with it -- you will be surprised how much you can speak after even just one semester. There is no better program for learning the language.","Chinese Ba undoubtedly requires a good deal of work, but if you are interested in really learning Mandarin and you are willing to put in the time, it is an extremely rewarding course. This is not a class to that you take to fulfill a requirement - you have to truly want to learn. But you will be amazed by how much you are able to learn in just a semester. I definitely recommend this course!","if you want to do well in this course make sure you have a lot of time set aside for it because it requires a lot of memorization and studying since there are two quizzes a week.","Be prepared for Chinese to become an integral part of your life. It will be there when you aren't busy, and it will be there when you have three midterms and a paper due all in one week. However, also be ready to be utterly enchanted by this new friend of yours who is always around. You'll laugh in class, you'll be enthused in class, at times, you may even cry in class, but you'll never be in any doubt in class that this course is worth taking"]},"Fall '14":{"comments":["If you're looking to learn Chinese this is the absolute best place to do it. The teachers really care about your experience in the class and are willing to help you individually anytime you need it.","From someone who has studied several languages, Chinese Ba is far and above the best language course I have taken. Mandarin is a difficult language to learn, but throughout this course I felt a tangible sense of progress each class session. The teachers are helpful and enthusiastic, and all of the work assigned pointed at a goal of being able to converse fluently in the language, which it accomplished very well.","Do the work diligently, don't fall behind. The course is easy if you put enough time in and are consistent.","It is a great class to pick up a difficult language that Chinese is. You will get a lot out of it if you put in the time and the effort.","You will learn quite a bit of Chinese for a beginning class. However, be prepared to commit time to memorizing characters especially. The grammar is not especially hard.","This class will be a lot of work, but the language skills you will emerge with are extremely rewarding.","Chinese Ba is an excellent and very well organized course. All the instructors are very helpful and genuinely try to make the course fun. The drill section was probably the best part of the course. It both reinforced the material from lecture, and allowed people to get to know their classmates. That said, Chinese is a very difficult language, and be aware that it's very easy to fall behind in lecture if you don't study for a few days.","This class is awesome -- if you have any interest in Mandarin Chinese, you should definitely consider taking it. Admittedly, the workload is rather immense, but the good thing is that you are never really faced with one huge assignment; rather, you end up doing a ton of smaller pieces of work (weekly homeworks, dialogue memorization, character practice for dictation etc) over the course of the entire semester. Do not do what I did and fall behind; the course can get very nerve-wracking in that case. This class is also great for those who think they simply \"don't possess the language gene\". After 3 months, you will be amazed when looking at the progress you've made.","This is an awesome course that teaches you a ton over the course of just one semester. If you have a lot of exposure to Chinese please don't take this class, you just make it harder on actual beginners like myself who are easily intimidated by people who took Chinese in high school. Great class if you're willing to put in the time!","Great way to learn a lot of Chinese in a short amount of time! Definitely requires work, but the teaching staff is amazing, and will make it worthwhile! I think anyone is capable of doing it if they put in the work.","Fantastic class with a great teaching staff who really want to help you. I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue studying Chinese after fulfilling my language requirement, but now I plan to take Chinese beyond the first year because the teachers made it such a great experience. This class does have a good amount of work, so be prepared to study a decent amount every week, especially in the beginning when you're doing the foundation work. It'll make the rest of the course much easier!","Keep up with the vocabulary and grammar! It will only make the later lessons easier to understand","If you want learn Chinese, this is the best way to learn it.","This class comes with a significant time commitment, but is well worth it. It gives you a functional knowledge of speaking\/reading\/writing Chinese.","This is not an easy class but if you love languages definitely take it.","This is a really solid introduction to Chinese. The teaching staff's teaching methods are very good. It feels like there has been research into language learning that went into designing this course","Chinese Ba is extremely strong in teaching spoken Mandarin. The instructors, who are extremely enthusiastic and friendly, reinforce language learning through call-and-response exercises and dialogues. Sections and lecture are genuinely fun (and, at times hilarious), which is a good thing, because this class meets every day. Every week, students are expected to teach themselves how to read approx. 40 characters, and write half as many. There are also weekly homework sheets, dialogue memorizations, and dictation quizzes. Though the workload ramps up towards the end of the course, it is completely do-able so long as you are diligent about practicing about half an hour every night. By the end of the semester, class will be taught almost entirely in Chinese, and you'll find yourself understanding every word.","It's tough but worth it! Very fast paced but at the end realizing how much you've learned in a completely new language is extremely rewarding.","Such a rewarding class!","This is a thorough, well-structured, and fun class.","If you're serious about wanting to learn Chinese, this course is for you. It moves at a quick but manageable pace. Don't expect to move through it like a romance language (I studied French), they're very different and Chinese requires a lot of your time. However, after one semester it'll feel extremely rewarding and I'm excited to continue studying it. I studied Chinese in China for a summer and while I learned a lot of spoken Chinese I left China not knowing how to read or write anything. This course is comprehensive and it covers it all!","Chinese Ba is hard. Even if you work diligently, it's hard. You're going to wake up some days and hate it, then feel okay about it, then hate it again. But it's worth it.","TAKE THIS COURSE if you have any interest in learning Chinese! It is challenging and time-consuming, especially if you aren't particularly adept at learning languages, but totally worth it. If you are willing to put in the work you will be amazed at how much you can learn in just one semester. I can't wait to continue my study of Chinese in this excellent department!","To master the language and truly excel in this class, you need to practice every single day. Chinese is very difficult, and if you don't maintain a strong study routine it could be a very long semester. But if you're willing to put in the time, this is an amazing opportunity; rarely at this university will you receive so much individual attention from excellent teachers.","Teachers are wonderful!","Very good and fun class to be, but don't slack off because you might be left behind forever due to its fast pace. But if you come to all the classes and sections, you'll be fine.","Take the course if you wanna learn Chinese. Don't take it for fun, unless you already know some Chinese. If you are true beginner, meaning you've had zero Chinese language experience, than be ready for a tough semester with a lot of studying. In the end, you learn a ton of Chinese, and the language that seemed so hard before starts looking easier and easier.","If you're interested in learning a language, learn chinese! It might be difficult at first (especially the tones!) but after a while, you get adjusted to the pace. Zhou Laoshi and the rest of the staff are very enthusiastic about teaching and will help you learn the most chinese you possibly can.","Wonderful course. You'll not only learn a ton (and watch your skills grow exponentially by the week) but have a ton of fun. I've never taken a class that's made me laugh so hard on a regular basis. The class exhibits some of the best teaching at Harvard (these instructors straight-up care about your learning), and if you've got a bit of a knack for languages, the work won't crush you whatsoever (the weekly assessments and homework are extremely reasonable). Lastly, you'll make friends in this course. Section thrice a week develops a real community.","This class moves at a very fast rate, but it a nice introduction course to learning Chinese.","If you've ever had any desire to learn Chinese, take this course!!! It was amazing from the instructors to how well the material is taught to the other students to how much you'll learn in just one semester (significantly more than one semester of a high school language class). The Harvard Chinese department is famous for how well it teaches around the world for good reason. It's also great, because the instructors rotate sections, so you get to have each for a bit. Unlike previous years, you could also opt to just learn simplified characters this year, which was great.  Also, even if you're an upperclassman, don't be hesitant to take it--I did, even though I've already satisfied my language requirement and had a fantastic time. The course is a mix of all years and graduate students, which was fun. As long as you do the work for each day (although there is something due virtually every day, it's not a lot), it's not as hard as others may make it out to be. Only downside--the course is located in Vanserg, which is absurdly far. It's hard to take classes on either side, because you'll be perpetually late.","It takes a lot of hours of work per week, but the progress you make toward the goal of learning the language is insane. But, seriously, sooooo much work.","Spend time practicing with a teacher and also on your own. Practice literally makes perfect.","It is a great course that is taught exceedingly well (much better than high school Chinese classes). That being said, there will be individuals in the class that have taken some Chinese before, just don't get discouraged.","Good course to start off learning Chinese. Lessons are structured logically and progress as a decent pace that is neither fast not slow. By the end of te semester, you will be surprised at how much you have learned and honestly be able to carry at least basic Chinese conversations. The only annoying part is that there are a lot of people with prior Chinese experience which may make it frustrating if you are just starting to learn. Overall great class and the teachers were all wonderful and sections is actually really fun!","Do not be afraid to take this class just because it's a completely new language! The regularity of the schedule makes sure that you can't fall behind as long as you put in a little work everyday, and the teachers are all very available and quick to help. There's also a lot of small assignments that end up as padding for your grade, so the course is overall very manageable.","Pay attention, and don't slack off, and you will be fine.","I decided to take Chinese as a junior after previously taking Spanish. I never studied Chinese before, and this class was very difficult. However, I have taken few classes at Harvard as rewarding as Chinese BA. Be ready to work, and, if you commit to the course, you will see incredible results.","This is the best taught class offered at Harvard. It is very difficult, but equally rewarding. This class is so awesome. I looked forward to going to Chinese everyday and I want to now pursue a Chinese citation so I can continue to work with this incredible department.","Be prepared to invest a ton of energy and time into this course. It is not a joke. If you're looking for an easy way to fulfill the foreign language requirement, look elsewhere.","The amount of work you do in this class depends on how much prior experience you have studying Chinese. If you have no exposure whatsoever, it will be a very challenging course. If you have studied a little bit of Chinese before, the class will be much, much more managable.","Even though many students come into Chinese Ba with a few years of Chinese classes, total beginners shouldn't be afraid to take this course; after all, it is supposed to cater to beginners. The professor and TFs will hold your hand in the beginning and through to the end of the course if you find you need it. The dialogues are fun and the class is quick and dynamic, so I personally enjoyed the class very much. I don't really recommend Chinese Ba to people who are looking to painlessly knock out a language requirement, but I definitely do to anyone who is remotely interested in the Chinese language.","Workload can get rigorous for someone with no background in Chinese, but it's well worth it. If you put in the time, you will look back and be amazed at how much you learn over the course of the semester.","If you are willing to be attentive and motivated throughout a semester in Chinese Ba, and if you recognize that your commitment (or lack thereof) one week will affect your understanding the next week, you are prepared for this class. Anyone with an interest in beginning Chinese should take this class; with enough study, you can excel.","1. You have a choice of whether to learn simplified or traditional.  Only learn traditional if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going into East Asian studies (or planning on studying something where you would need to be able to read older texts that are in traditional), or if you want to go to Taiwan and Hong Kong and want to be able to read things. Although even then, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not necessary.  Traditional is NOT helpful for if you want to go to mainland China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at all.  At first, professors use traditional all the time in class (in powerpoints, grammar handouts, etc.).  However,  by the end of the year, everything was being written in simplified.  \n\n2. Be prepared to spend a lot of time studying characters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking traditional.  You need to learn how to write 20 per week, but be able to recognize ALL the characters in the book for each lesson.  I made flashcards for everything, which was really helpful.  \n\n3. Overall, would recommend this class.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll really learn a lot, even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had Chinese before.  I was pleased with the amount of characters we learned and how much we could read by the end of the semester.  If your other classes involve a lot of writing (or if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a grad student), this class will be a nice departure from that.   Of course you still need to dedicate a lot of time to the class, but when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a different kind of homework from what you usually have, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice break.  It may be a lot of work, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel like you really learned and accomplished a lot by the time the semester is over. Definitely recommend!","This class is definitely worth your time! It is very fun and engaging, and you will learn a lot. All of the teachers are fantastic!","THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT HARVARD THUS FAR!!! Seriously, the Chinese Language Department is the most interactive and attentive department at Harvard. All the TFs and the Professor truly want you to succeed and they offer so many opportunities for you to ask questions and seek help. I have nothing bad to say about this course.","This is an excellent class! Teachers are supremely amazing, and the way they structure the classes are so efficient. Definitely take it, they make learning Chinese fun and enjoyable!","This course is very fast-paced and you have to be ready to put in a lot of outside work to be prepared in class and for assessments.","It is a lot. Work every day, so only take it if you are dedicated. But you learn so much.","A very instructive and even fun class to expose you to Chinese language as well as culture. The teaching staff is also wonderful and receptive.","teaching faculty is great and many opportunities to practice. very rewarding if you put in the work","If you are interested in chinese, take it 100%.  If you're not passionate about it, it might be a challenge","You can't go wrong with this class - it's harder to learn than some other languages because characters are completely different from letters, but it has a lot of applications and it also opens up the possibility of working\/studying abroad in Asia.","If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the best way to get started.  You learn so much, and build such a good foundation with such little time.","Chinese is a great language to learn, and this course does a great job doing it. It can require a good deal of work and memorization, but it is worth it.","really amazing program. take advantage of the languages at this school, you won't regret it. You need to put time in and it's not an easy class, but if you want to learn Chinese there is no better place to do it."]}},"mostRecentQ":{"overall":"4.60","workload":"6.90","difficulty":null,"recommendation":"4.50","enrollment":"92","response rate":"81.52","QCourseOverall":{"number":"CHNSE Ba","course_id":"755","cat_num":"4375","1s":"0","2s":"0","3s":"4","4s":"19","5s":"51"},"QDifficulty":{"number":"CHNSE Ba","course_id":"755","cat_num":"4375","1s":"0","2s":"8","3s":"26","4s":"37","5s":"15"},"QWorkload":{"number":"CHNSE Ba","course_id":"755","cat_num":"4375","1s":"11","2s":"25","3s":"21","4s":"5","5s":"4"}},"success":true}
