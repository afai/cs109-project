    "The Q data we received consisted of about 2300 JSON files, each one representing a unique course's historical Q scores for each available semester. Out first task was to combine these individual JSON files into a single JSON Lines file; the JSON files were stored locally outside of the repository directory, and we used the `shututil` and `glob` libraries to concatenate these into `qall.jsonl`. Because the individual JSON files are local, we used the `os.path` library to check if the JSONL file already exists and to prevent the code from running if it does."
